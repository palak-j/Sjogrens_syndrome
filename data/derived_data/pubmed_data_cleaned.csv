0,1,Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is the 2nd most common chronic autoimmune rheumatic disease and associated with a high burden of illness.
1,1,Morbidity arises not only from untreated xerostomia and keratoconjunctivitis sicca but also from extra-glandular manifestations including the development of non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphomas.
2,1,Proper diagnosis of SS requires objective evidence of dry eyes and/or objective evidence of dry mouth as well as proof of autoimmunity.
3,1,The recent development of new international classification criteria and clinical practice guidelines for SS should not only enhance the existing standards of care but also facilitate further studies to improve future diagnosis and outcomes.
4,2,Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease affecting the lacrimal glands resulting in dry eye disease (DED).
5,2,Ophthalmologists may be the first line of detection of Sjogren's syndrome given the frequency of DED in SS and that dry eye is often the presenting symptom.
6,2,"Numerous symptom questionnaires and tests have been developed to help diagnose DED, but as of yet, there is no ""gold standard."""
7,2,Minimally invasive objective metrics are needed for a reliable diagnosis of DED.
8,2,Currently there is no single test to diagnose SS-associated DED.
9,2,"Although there are several approaches to treatment, none are specific for DED in SS, and, generally, several methods need to be tried to find what works best for a specific patient."
10,2,"Treatment for DED continues to be an unmet medical need, especially given that DED in SS is typically on the severe end of the spectrum."
11,3,"Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the exocrine glands, resulting in dryness of the eyes and mouth due to lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary and lacrimal glands along with arthritis, kidney, liver, and lung involvement, chronic fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, vasculitis, and so on."
12,3,Considerable advance has been made for the classification and treatment of primary SS in the past few years.
13,3,This article reviews the recent classification criteria for primary SS and briefly discusses the conventional and novel therapies of the disease.
14,4,"Sjgren's syndrome is a lymphoproliferative disease with autoimmune features characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration of exocrine glands, notably the lacrimal and salivary glands."
15,4,"These lymphoid infiltrations lead to dryness of the eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), dryness of the mouth (xerostomia), and, frequently, dryness of other surfaces connected to exocrine glands."
16,4,Sjgren's syndrome is associated with the production of autoantibodies because B-cell activation is a consistent immunoregulatory abnormality.
17,4,The spectrum of the disease extends from an organ-specific autoimmune disorder to a systemic process and is also associated with an increased risk of B-cell lymphoma.
18,4,Current treatments are mainly symptomatic.
19,4,"As a result of the diverse presentation of the syndrome, a major challenge remains to improve diagnosis and therapy."
20,4,For this purpose an international set of classification criteria for primary Sjgren's syndrome has recently been developed and validated and seems well suited for enrolment in clinical trials.
21,4,"Salivary gland biopsies have been examined and histopathology standards have been developed, to be used in clinical trials and patient stratification."
22,4,"Finally, ultrasonography and saliva meet the need of non-invasive imaging and sampling methods for discovery and validation of disease biomarkers in Sjgren's syndrome."
23,5,A 41-year-old woman presented with paresthesia and inability to walk for 7 days.
24,5,"She had history of fatigue, polyarthralgia and difficulty in swallowing food for the last 1year."
25,5,She became edentulous over the last 5 years and wore dentures for the same.
26,5,"She appeared pale, emaciated and had oral thrush."
27,5,She had areflexic quadriparesis with weakness more in lower limbs compared with upper limbs.
28,5,"With the initial diagnosis of Guillian-Barre syndrome, she was given five cycles of plasmapheresis following which there was a significant improvement in power."
29,5,Sjogren's syndrome was suspected based on edentulous state in a middle-aged woman with multisystem involvement.
30,5,"Evaluation with Schirmer's test, parotid scintigraphy and labial minor salivary gland biopsy confirmed the diagnosis."
31,5,She was treated with steroids following which a dramatic improvement in haemoglobin and total leucocyte count was noted.
32,5,We report a varied presentation of primary Sjogren's syndrome.
33,6,BACKGROUND: To systematically review and assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treating primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS).
34,6,"METHODS: Five electronic databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of science, Ovid, Cochrane Library) were searched for randomized controlled trials and retrospective or prospective studies published in English that reported the effect of HCQ on pSS."
35,6,"The subjective symptoms (sicca symptoms, fatigue and pain) and the objective indexes (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and Schirmer test) were assessed as main outcome measures."
36,6,A meta-analysis and descriptive study on the efficacy and safety of HCQ were conducted.
37,6,"The estimate of the effect of HCQ treatment was expressed as a proportion together with 95% confidence interval, and plotted on a forest plot."
38,6,"RESULTS: Four trials with totals of 215 SS patients, including two randomized controlled trials, one double blind crossover trial and one retrospective open-label study, were analyzed in this review."
39,6,"For dry mouth and dry eyes, the effectiveness of HCQ treatment was essentially the same as placebo treatment."
40,6,"For fatigue, the effectiveness of HCQ was lower than placebo."
41,6,The efficacy of HCQ in treating pain associated with pSS was superior to that of the placebo.
42,6,"There was no significant difference between HCQ-treated groups and controls in terms of Schirmer test results, but HCQ could reduce the erythrocyte sedimentation rate compare with placebo."
43,6,A descriptive safety assessment showed that gastrointestinal adverse effects were the most common adverse effects associated with HCQ.
44,6,CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review showed that there is no significant difference between HCQ and placebo in the treatment of dry mouth and dry eye in pSS.
45,6,"Well-designed, randomized, controlled trials are needed to provide higher-quality evidence to confirm our findings, and future studies should focus on some other index or extraglandular measures, such as cutaneous manifestations, to further explore the therapeutic effect of HCQ in pSS."
46,7,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a condition that predominantly affects women.
47,7,Reports of pregnancy outcome in these patients are limited and contradictory.
48,7,OBJECTIVE: To describe pregnancy characteristics and outcomes and newborn morbidity in women with pSS.
49,7,MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included women with pSS who became pregnant after the onset of the symptoms of the disease.
50,7,"Clinical and serological characteristics, risk factors and previous maternal comorbidities are described."
51,7,"For each pregnancy in a woman with pSS, we recorded pregnancy course and outcome and newborn condition."
52,7,RESULTS: We assessed 11 patients with 18 pregnancies after the onset of pSS symptoms.
53,7,All of them presented FAN +; 10 anti-Ro / SSA + and 7 anti-La / SSB +.
54,7,The mean age in years at the onset of symptoms was 24.9 (SD 6.9) and at the time of pregnancy was 30.3 (SD 5.4).
55,7,"Thirteen pregnancies happened before the diagnosis, reporting only one miscarriage."
56,7,"Two preterm births, 1 case of oligohydramnios, 2 of premature membrane rupture and 2 low birthweight babies were reported after the onset of pSS symptoms."
57,7,There was 1 newborn with congenital atrioventricular block and another with neonatal cutaneous lupus.
58,7,All the women with pregnancy complications (n=6) had anti-Ro/SSA antibodies.
59,7,CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of the pregnancies assessed in women with pSS were associated with complications not attributable to factors other than the disease.
60,8,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a complex systemic autoimmune disease primarily characterised by a focal chronic inflammation of glandular parenchyma, with chronic and persistent involvement of major salivary gland remaining a key element of the disease."
61,8,"Indeed, classification criteria proposed for pSS have always included items for histological and/or imaging salivary gland assessment."
62,8,"Over time, the approach to the definition of glandular involvement in pSS is constantly evolving."
63,8,"In this review we will therefore illustrate the state of the art of imaging techniques in pSS, focusing on conventional and novel modalities and discussing their advantages, drawbacks and possible future developments."
64,9,"PURPOSE: Sjgren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease affecting approximately 3 million Americans, primarily perimenopausal women."
65,9,"The syndrome is characterized by dysfunction and destruction of exocrine glands leading to oral and ocular manifestations, xerostomia and keratitis sicca."
66,9,Sjgren's syndrome commonly remains either undiagnosed or is diagnosed years after the onset of symptoms.
67,9,"Diagnosis is based on the concurrent presence of various signs and symptoms of the disease as established by 6 diagnostic standards set by the American European Consensus Group standards: oral symptoms, ocular symptoms, evidence of oral signs, evidence of ocular dryness, evidence of salivary gland involvement with positive Anti-Ro/La autoantibodies and a positive gland biopsy."
68,9,Currently no definitive test or cure exists; treatment is predominately palliative and supportive.
69,9,"CONCLUSION: With an aging population and heavier reliance on medications and treatments which cause xerostomia, oral health professionals are likely to encounter a higher incidence of xerostomia and Sjgren's syndrome more than ever before."
70,9,"The dental professional must recognize the signs and symptoms of xerostomia, include Sjgren's syndrome in their differential diagnosis, and communicate those findings and concerns to other health care providers, including the primary care physician, rheumatologist and ophthalmologist for evaluation in a timely fashion."
71,9,"This article discusses the dental professional's role in formulating a preventive oral health plan: meticulous oral hygiene instructions, dietary counseling, a complement of chemotherapeutic agents and more frequent recall care to avoid oral complications and improve quality of life."
72,9,"Dental hygienists can help patients understand the wide range of products available to substitute or stimulate salivary flow, prevent or remineralize early carious lesions and relieve candidal and bacterial infections."
73,9,Ultimately this collaboration of care by the dental and medical professionals will benefit the Sjgren's syndrome patient and lead to better patient outcomes.
74,10,"This review discusses important aspects of the diagnosis and management of Sjgren's syndrome, covering clinical features, diagnosis and management, and summarizes recent developments in diagnosis, prognostication and treatment."
75,11,"Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease, among the most common ones, that targets mainly the exocrine glands as well as extra-glandular epithelial tissues."
76,11,"Their lymphocytic infiltration leads to manifestations from other organs (e.g., kidneys, lungs, liver, or thyroid), apart from sicca symptoms (xerostomia and keratoconjunctivitis)."
77,11,SS is more prevalent in women than in men (9:1).
78,11,"Moreover, p.SS patients are in increased risk to develop lymphoma."
79,11,"Certain autoantibodies (e.g., antibodies against ribonucleoprotein autoantigens Ro-SSA and La-SSB) are ultimate hallmarks for the disease."
80,11,It was not known until recently that culture-independent techniques like next-generation sequencing (NGS) facilitate the study of the microbe communities in humans and scientists achieved to define the outlines of the microbiome contribution in health and disease.
81,11,"Researchers have started to investigate the alterations in diversity of the oral, ocular, or intestinal microbiota in SS."
82,11,Recent studies indicate that dysbiosis may play a significant role in SS pathogenesis.
83,11,"At the same time, the cause or effect is not clear yet because the dysfunction of salivary glands induces alterations in oral and intestinal microbiome which is linked to worsen of symptoms and disease severity."
84,11,"If the human microbiome proves to play a key role in pathogenesis and manifestation of SS, the next step could be new and promising therapeutic approaches such as probiotics or prebiotics."
85,11,"This mini review focuses on the alterations of microbiome of SS patients, their connection with immune tolerance and new therapeutic strategies involving diet manipulation toward future personalized medicine."
86,12,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate current evidence on the efficacy and safety of topical and systemic medications in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (SjS) to inform European League Against Rheumatism treatment recommendations.
87,12,"METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for case-control/prospective cohort studies, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews."
88,12,"RESULTS: Current evidence in primary SjS patients fulfilling the 2002 criteria is based on the data from 9 RCTs, 18 prospective cohort studies and 5 case-control studies."
89,12,Two Cochrane systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have reported that topical treatments for dry mouth and dry eye are safe and effective.
90,12,Ocular cyclosporine A was safe and effective in two RCTs including 1039 patients with dry eye syndrome.
91,12,"Two Cochrane SLRs on serum tear drops and plugs showed inconsistency in possible benefits, both for symptoms and objective measures."
92,12,Five RCTs reported significant improvements in oral dryness and salivary flow rates for pilocarpine and cevimeline.
93,12,"An RCT showed no significant placebo-differences for hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day for the primary outcome (visual analogue scale (VAS) composite of dryness, fatigue and pain)."
94,12,We identified seven RCTs carried out in primary SjS patients.
95,12,"RCTs using infliximab, anakinra and baminercept found no placebo-differences for the primary outcomes."
96,12,"The two largest RCTs randomised 255 patients to receive rituximab or placebo and reported no significant results in the primary outcome (VAS composite), while prospective studies suggested efficacy in systemic disease."
97,12,"CONCLUSION: The current evidence supporting the use of the main topical therapeutic options of primary SjS is solid, while limited data from RCTs are available to guide systemic therapies."
98,13,OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that the extravasation of saliva from damaged ducts with lymphocytic infiltration in patients with Sjgren's syndrome causes ranulas.
99,13,There are too many uncertainties to support this hypothesis.
100,13,The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an association between Sjgren's syndrome and ranulas.
101,13,MATERIALS AND METHODS: We observed three cases of patients with ranulas who were also diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome at the same facility.
102,13,"These cases led to the question of whether there are other such cases, and thus, an exhaustive literature search was conducted."
103,13,RESULTS: Three cases in two case reports of mucocele of the floor of the mouth associated with adult Sjgren's syndrome were noted.
104,13,"Including our cases, until now, there have been six cases of ranula with adult Sjgren's syndrome."
105,13,"CONCLUSIONS: It could be useful to investigate whether patients presenting with a ranula are also affected by Sjgren's syndrome and, conversely, investigate patients with Sjgren's syndrome longitudinally to see whether they develop ranulas."
106,14,Sjgren syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune connective tissue disorder (CTD) that principally affects the lacrimal and salivary glands.
107,14,"Although SS is 1 of the 3 most common autoimmune CTDs alongside systemic lupus erythematosus and progressive systemic sclerosis, it is the least researched CTD overall."
108,14,SS poses a particular diagnostic challenge because it shares multiple clinical and immunologic features with other CTDs.
109,14,"However, there are some characteristic cutaneous clinical features that can precede the well-known sicca symptoms by years."
110,14,"By familiarizing themselves with these clinical features and having a high suspicion for SS, dermatologists can play an important role in the early diagnosis and treatment of this disease."
111,15,"BACKGROUND Sjgren's syndrome is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, which is also known as sicca syndrome, due to the symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth, and is associated with other connective tissue diseases and autoimmune diseases."
112,15,Sjgren's syndrome can also be associated with renal involvement.
113,15,Fanconi's syndrome is associated with impaired reabsorption in the proximal renal tubule associated with tubulointerstitial nephritis and is associated with renal tubular acidosis and hypophosphatemia.
114,15,"Osteomalacia is a rare association with Sjgren's syndrome, which may result from renal disease."
115,15,"CASE REPORT We report the case of a 34-year-old woman who presented with xerostomia, xerophthalmia, bone fractures, and osteomuscular pain."
116,15,"A Schirmer test showed reduced tear production, and a biopsy of a minor salivary gland of the lip, with high titers of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and positive anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies confirmed the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome."
117,15,Serum and urinary laboratories tests and clinical manifestations confirmed Fanconi's syndrome associated with osteomalacia.
118,15,"The patient was treated with potassium supplements, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone, with a favorable response."
119,15,"CONCLUSIONS This case is of a rare association between Sjgren's syndrome, Fanconi's syndrome, and osteomalacia."
120,15,"Even though these are rare clinical associations, early detection can improve the quality of life and prevent further complications."
121,16,The diffuse cystic lung diseases have a broad differential diagnosis.
122,16,A wide variety of pathophysiological processes spanning the spectrum from airway obstruction to lung remodeling can lead to multifocal cyst development in the lung.
123,16,"Although lymphangioleiomyomatosis and pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis are perhaps more frequently seen in the clinic, disorders such as Birt-Hogg-Dub syndrome, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, follicular bronchiolitis, and light-chain deposition disease are increasingly being recognized."
124,16,"Obtaining an accurate diagnosis can be challenging, and management approaches are highly disease dependent."
125,16,"Unique imaging features, genetic tests, serum studies, and clinical features provide invaluable clues that help clinicians distinguish among the various etiologies, but biopsy is often required for definitive diagnosis."
126,16,"In part II of this review, we present an overview of the diffuse cystic lung diseases caused by lymphoproliferative disorders, genetic mutations, or aberrant lung development and provide an approach to aid in their diagnosis and management."
127,17,The neurologic manifestations of primary Sjgren syndrome are varied and can be divided anatomically into 2 categories: peripheral neuropathies and central nervous system (CNS) conditions.
128,17,Distal sensory and sensorimotor neuropathies are the most common manifestations of peripheral nerve disease in primary Sjgren syndrome.
129,17,"CNS manifestations associated with primary Sjgren syndrome include focal central lesions, conditions that mimic multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, cerebellar syndromes, movement disorders, and problems with memory, cognition, and depression."
130,17,"The heterogeneity of neurologic manifestations in primary Sjgren syndrome complicates the approach to treatment, which should be directed toward the underlying neuropathologic mechanism."
131,18,"Small fiber neuropathy, which affects the sensory A and Cfibers, is now a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge."
132,18,Nearly 7% of the general population have chronic neuropathic pain responsible for severe quality-of-life impairments.
133,18,"Awareness must therefore be raised among clinicians of the somatosensory and autonomic symptoms that can reveal small fiber neuropathy, appropriate diagnostic investigations, most common causes, and best treatment options for each patient profile."
134,18,"To help achieve this goal, the present review article discusses the clinical presentation of neuropathic pain and paresthesia and/or autonomic dysfunction due to involvement of nerves supplying exocrine glands and smooth muscle; normal findings from standard electrophysiological investigations; most informative diagnostic tests (epidermal nerve fiber density in a skin biopsy, laser-evoked potentials, heat- and cold-detection thresholds, electrochemical skin conductance); main causes, which consist chiefly of metabolic diseases (diabetes mellitus, glucose intolerance), dysimmunity syndromes (Sjgren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, monoclonal gammopathy), and genetic abnormalities (familial amyloidosis due to a transthyretin mutation, Fabry disease, sodium channel diseases); and the available symptomatic and etiological treatments."
135,19,PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjgren syndrome are chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorders that can present with multiorgan involvement including the lungs.
136,19,"This review will focus on recent literature pertaining to the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation and diagnosis and management of SLE and Sjgren syndrome-associated pulmonary conditions."
137,19,RECENT FINDINGS: Pulmonary manifestations of both disease entities have been well characterized and lung involvement can be observed during the course of the disease in most cases.
138,19,"Pulmonary manifestations of SLE and Sjgren syndrome can be classified based on anatomical site of involvement; and the large and small airways, lung parenchyma, lung vasculature, pleura and respiratory muscles can be involved."
139,19,"The pleura is most commonly involved in SLE, whereas the airways are most commonly involved in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
140,19,Sleep disturbances have also been described in both entities.
141,19,"SUMMARY: Although further research into treatment strategies for the pulmonary complications seen in SLE and pSS is needed, the clinician should be aware of the risk factors and clinical presentation of the various pulmonary complications in SLE and pSS in order to identify patients who should be screened and/or have modifications in treatment strategies to mitigate the morbidity and mortality associated with these complications."
142,20,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a complex and heterogeneous disorder characterised by a wide spectrum of glandular and extra-glandular features.
143,20,"Novel insights into disease pathogenesis and the discovery of novel biomarkers are allowing us to characterise the disease not only phenotypically on the basis of clinical presentation, but also on the basis of the endotype."
144,20,"Ultimately, a better stratification of patients may pave new avenues for novel targeted therapies, opening new possibilities for the application of personalised medicine in pSS."
145,21,"OBJECTIVES: The present cross-sectional study aimed to estimate the prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and define the clinical, functional and imaging characteristics of symptomatic pulmonary disease in pSS."
146,21,METHODS: Four hundred and fourteen consecutive pSS patients were interviewed for the presence of chronic respiratory complaints (cough and/or dyspnea).
147,21,Symptomatic pSS patients without respiratory or other comorbidities underwent further investigation with clinical evaluation and assessment with pulmonary functional testing (PFTs) and chest high resolution CT (hrCT) on inspiratory and expiratory phase.
148,21,Comparison of clinical and laboratory features between symptomatic and asymptomatic pSS patients was also performed.
149,21,RESULTS: Prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms in pSS was estimated at 21.5% (89/414).
150,21,Symptoms were attributed to underlying comorbidities in approximately one third of cases (30/89).
151,21,Thirty nine of the remaining 59 patients were finally assessed with PFTs and hrCT.
152,21,Small airway disease was diagnosed in 20 individuals with an obstructive pattern in PFTs and/or compatible radiological signs.
153,21,"Seven patients were diagnosed with interstitial lung disease, while in the remaining 12 pSS patients, with normal PFTs and hrCT, symptoms were attributed to xerotrachea."
154,21,Raynaud's phenomenon occurred more frequently in symptomatic than asymptomatic patients (p=0.024).
155,21,CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one fifth of a large cohort of pSS patients presented chronic respiratory symptoms.
156,21,"Small airway disease was the most commonly recognized pulmonary disorder among symptomatic pSS patients, followed by xerotrachea and interstitial lung disease."
157,22,The prevalence of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is between 1:100 and 1:1000 and it is therefore the most common connective tissue disease.
158,22,"Nevertheless, it can be difficult to diagnose pSS as the symptoms are frequently unspecific and diagnostic markers are lacking in many patients."
159,22,"In addition, only few controlled therapeutic studies of pSS have been carried out so that the optimal management is not yet clear."
160,22,"Meanwhile, outcome parameters to monitor clinical improvement have been developed and alarge number of therapeutic studies are currently being performed."
161,22,This review article summarizes the current diagnostic and treatment options for pSS.
162,23,This study investigated the clinical characteristics and risk factors for overlapping rheumatoid arthritis and Sjgren's syndrome (RA/SS).
163,23,Patients with RA/SS in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2012 to January 2017 were retrospectively analysed and compared to those of sex- and age-matched RA or SS controls.
164,23,Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors.
165,23,"Altogether, 105 consecutive patients with RA/SS were enrolled."
166,23,"Ninety-seven (92.4%) of them were female, with a mean age of 51.513.3 years or 45.214.7years at the diagnosis of SS or RA, respectively."
167,23,"In addition to arthritis and Sicca symptom, patients with RA/SS had more visceral involvements including interstitial lung disease (ILD), and haematologic involvement, and received more glucocorticoid treatments than controls (p<0.05)."
168,23,"RA-onset, simultaneous-onset and SS-onset patients had significant differences in age at RA diagnosis, fever and thrombocytopenia (p<0.05)."
169,23,"Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that arthritis (OR=44.804), rheumatoid factor (RF) (OR=5.973), and anti-CCP (OR=2.545) were independent risk factors for SS overlapping with RA."
170,23,"Xerostomia (OR=3.960), ILD (OR=6.210), and anti-SSA (OR=24.640) were independent predictors of RA overlapping with SS."
171,23,RA/SS patients have more visceral involvements.
172,23,Our findings highlight the roles of arthritis/RF/anti-CCP and xerostomia/ILD/anti-SSA in the development of this overlapping disease.
173,24,"Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that mainly affects the exocrine glands, leading to generalized mucosal dryness."
174,24,"However, primary SjS may initially present with non-sicca (systemic) manifestations."
175,24,"When these features appear before the onset of an overt sicca syndrome, we may talk of an underlying 'occult' SjS."
176,24,The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) has promoted and supported an international collaborative study group (EULAR-SS Task Force) aimed at developing consensual recommendations to provide a homogeneous approach to the patient with primary SjS presenting with systemic involvement.
177,24,"This review summarizes the key factors that should be taken into account in the diagnostic approach in a patient with suspected SjS according to the main clinical patterns of presentation, and is especially focused on organ-specific systemic disease presentations, including a consensus set of recommendations in order to reach an early diagnosis."
178,24,Close collaboration with the different specialties involved through a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach is essential in SjS patients presenting with systemic involvements.
179,25,OBJECTIVE: Review the clinical manifestations and treatment of primary Sjgren's syndrome.
180,25,"DATA SOURCES: Articles indexed in PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library in the past 10 years using the key words ""Sjgren,"" ""Sjgren's syndrome,"" ""Sjgren's disease,"" and ""Sjgren's syndrome AND treatment."""
181,25,Primary sources were used to locate additional resources.
182,25,STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Forty-six publications were reviewed and criteria supporting the primary objective were used to identify useful resources.
183,25,"DATA SYNTHESIS: The literature included practice guidelines, review articles, original research articles, and prescribing information for the manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of primary Sjgren's syndrome."
184,25,"CONCLUSION: Primary Sjgren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease with various clinical manifestations, notably dry eye, dry mouth, fatigue, and inflammatory musculoskeletal pain."
185,25,"Most patients are under the care of a dentist, ophthalmologist, and rheumatologist."
186,25,"There is currently no cure; therapy is tailored for each patient to reduce symptoms, avoid complications, and improve quality of life."
187,25,Respondents to a recent survey conducted by the Sjgren's Syndrome Foundation reported using more than eight medications and treatments for their symptoms; more than 60% of respondents were older than 60 years of age.
188,25,Pharmacists familiar with recommended treatment options can provide advice and counseling to Sjgren's syndrome patients on multi-drug regimens prescribed by different health care practitioners.
189,26,BACKGROUND: Determinants of diagnosis in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) in tertiary care settings is not well understood.
190,26,METHODS: Patients were screened by tracing reports of anti-SSA (anti-Ro) antibody assays between January 2008 and October 2015.
191,26,Electronic health records (EHR) were reviewed.
192,26,Patients fulfilling the 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria were included.
193,26,"Variables including the specialties of first consultation, initial clinical presentations, investigations ordered at first consultation, number of hospital visits prior to reaching the final diagnosis of pSS and the baseline EULAR SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) were noted."
194,26,RESULTS: A total of 275 patients with pSS consulted 24 different specialties at first visit.
195,26,Rheumatology accounted for 128 (46.55%) patients.
196,26,"At first consultation, initial suspicion for pSS was 48.4% for all specialties together and 64.84% for the rheumatologist."
197,26,"Median number of visits prior to arriving at the final diagnosis was 1 (1-6), when the initial impression was pSS and 3 (1-14), if the initial clinical impression was a non-SS differential (P<0.001)."
198,26,"A first impression of pSS, enquiry about sicca symptoms and ordering anti-SSA (anti-Ro) antibody test at first consultation were strong predictors of early diagnosis with odds (95% CI) of 5.01 (1.72-14.55) P<0.001, 4.79 (1.16-19.84) P=0.03 and 9.60 (3.0-30.67) P<0.0001, respectively."
199,26,None of the clinical variables proved to be useful predictors of early diagnosis.
200,26,CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of pSS is challenging even in tertiary care centers as patients present with myriad features to several specialties.
201,26,Initial suspicion was limited to 48.4% for all specialties together and 64.84% for the rheumatologist.
202,26,High suspicion of pSS along with ordering anti-SSA (anti-Ro) antibody could hasten diagnosis.
203,27,"In 9-20% of cases, Sjgren's syndrome is associated with various respiratory symptoms."
204,27,The most typical manifestations are chronic interstitial lung disease (ILD) and tracheobronchial disease.
205,27,The most common manifestation of ILD is nonspecific interstitial pneumonia in its fibrosing variant.
206,27,"Other types of ILD, such as organising pneumonia, usual interstitial pneumonia and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, are rare."
207,27,"Their radiological presentation is less distinctive, and definitive diagnosis may require the use of transbronchial or surgical lung biopsy."
208,27,"Corticosteroid therapy is the mainstay of ILD treatment in Sjgren's syndrome, but the use of other immunosuppressive drugs needs to be determined."
209,27,ILD is a significant cause of death in Sjgren's syndrome.
210,27,"Tracheobronchial disease is common in Sjgren's syndrome, characterised by diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of the airway."
211,27,It is sometimes responsible for a crippling chronic cough.
212,27,"It can also present in the form of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis or recurrent respiratory infections."
213,27,The management of these manifestations may require treatment for dryness and/or inflammation of the airways.
214,27,Airway disease has little effect on respiratory function and is rarely the cause of death in Sjgren's syndrome patients.
215,27,"Rare respiratory complications such as amyloidosis, lymphoma or pulmonary hypertension should not be disregarded in Sjgren's syndrome patients."
216,28,"Sjgren's syndrome is a complex and potentially disabling slow progressive, systemic disorder."
217,28,"During the last twelve months several original and important contributions have been published on the pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy of the disease."
218,28,"This review, following the others of this series is aimed at summarising some of the most significant studies that have been recently published."
219,28,"Regarding the pathogenesis, we will specifically focus on novel insights on miRNA, gut microbiota, adaptive and innate autoimmunity and animal models."
220,28,"Concerning novelties in pSS diagnosis, we will focus on salivary gland ultrasonography and histology."
221,28,"Finally, we will conclude with an update of the clinical manifestations of the disease and with an overview of the future therapies."
222,29,"BACKGROUND: Besides CSF-flow obstruction, syringomyelia is associated with inflammatory spinal cord lesions."
223,29,"However, syringomyelia-like syndrome concomitant with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is extremely rare."
224,29,"Here, we would like to report a case of a patient with syringomyelia-like syndrome in NMOSD complicated with Sjogren's Syndrome."
225,29,"CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-old male Han Chinese, presented with three episodes of acute demyelinating processes in the central nervous system within 5years."
226,29,"Firstly, he presented with ascending left lower extremity weakness and numbness, and initially progressive loss of vision in the right eye before 5years, and subsequently in the right eye 2months later."
227,29,High dose corticosteroid therapy was prescribed for this attack.
228,29,"Second, he suffered from refractory gastrointestinal symptoms."
229,29,"such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and early satiety."
230,29,"After the second episode, he received long-term azathioprine and prednisone treatment in low dosages."
231,29,"Six months before admission, he developed the lower back pain and numbness in lower limbs, and urinary incontinence."
232,29,"This time, he complained of acute onset of right lower limb paralysis, paresthesia and urinary incontinence."
233,29,MRI of the spine revealed a syringomyelia extending from the C7 to T4 levels with serum positive anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-Ab) (indirect immunofluorescence on AQP4 transfected cells).
234,29,he was serologically positive for both anti-Sjgren's syndrome-related antigen A and B antibodies and there was reduced salivary flow on scintigraphy.
235,29,Lip salivary gland (LSG) biopsies were graded (grade four lymphocytic infiltration) according to the Chisholm and Mason classification system and by morphometric analysis.
236,29,"And finally, diagnosed as syringomyelia-like syndrome in NMOSD complicated with Sjogren's syndrome."
237,29,"CONCLUSIONS: Although extremely rare, This index patient highlights that syringomyelia could be associated with underlying NMOSD and pSS, and autoimmune disorders should be considered in the initial differential diagnosis, This is very helpful for the therapeutic implications and evaluating curative effect."
238,30,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic multisystem autoimmune rheumatic disease characterised by female predominance.
239,30,"Although the disease is rare in the male and paediatric populations, it has been suggested that it may have a different disease phenotype, which has not been investigated before using a systematic approach."
240,30,"A systematic literature search of PubMed databases (updated to December 2016) was performed to identify all published data on the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory manifestations of pSS in the male and paediatric populations."
241,30,"The literature search of the male and paediatric pSS studies identified 2025 and 186 citations, respectively, out of which 7 and 5 fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were analysed further."
242,30,The range of age at disease onset was 9.4-10.7years for children and 39.4-56.9years at diagnosis for male patients.
243,30,"We identified a prevalence of extra-glandular manifestations between 52.6-92.3% in the male population and 50.0-84.6% in children, while abnormal sialometry was only reported in the paediatric population, with a prevalence between 71.4 and 81.8%."
244,30,"There was a significant variation of positive serological markers, with anti-Ro antibodies reported between 15.7-75.0% and 36.4-84.6%, and anti-La antibodies between 5.6-51.7% and 27.3-65.4%, in the male and paediatric populations, respectively."
245,30,The characteristics of pSS in the male and paediatric populations varied according to different studies.
246,30,"When compared to data available from pSS adult populations, children diagnosed with pSS reported less dryness and had a higher prevalence of parotitis, lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms and male patients were younger at the time of diagnosis."
247,30,This systematic review contributes to a better understanding of the epidemiology of pSS in rare populations.
248,30,Large longitudinal cohort studies comparing male with female patients and adult with paediatric patients are needed.
249,31,PURPOSE: Diagnostic testing for dry eye disease (DED) in Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is well described.
250,31,Little is published about monitoring this systemic autoimmune DED.
251,31,We analyzed the SS related DED tests used in North American optometric practices and compared academic settings to private practice settings.
252,31,METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 123 SS charts from 6 optometric practices in North America was conducted.
253,31,Testing done during the first examination following a SS diagnosis was recorded on Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database.
254,31,The complete data file was reviewed and testing type and methodology were compared.
255,31,"RESULTS: Symptoms of DED (98.4% of charts),meibomian gland dysfunction (76.4% of charts), corneal staining with fluorescein (75.6% of charts) and anterior blepharitis (73.2% of charts) were the most frequently recorded variables."
256,31,Clinicians used different methodologies to measure and grade these variables.
257,31,Private practitioners were more likely to use symptom questionnaires and grading scales and to describe anterior blepharitis.
258,31,Academic settings were more likely to record TBUT and tear meniscus height.
259,31,CONCLUSIONS: The monitoring of DED in SS is not uniform in optometric offices across North America.
260,31,Creating accepted standards of testing will improve the ability of clinicians and researchers to communicate and understand the course of DED in SS.
261,32,"Sjgren syndrome (SjS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the exocrine glands (mainly the salivary and lacrimal glands) and results in the severe dryness of mucosal surfaces, principally in the mouth and eyes."
262,32,"This disease predominantly affects middle-aged women, but can also be observed in children, men and the elderly."
263,32,The clinical presentation of SjS is heterogeneous and can vary from sicca symptoms to systemic disease (characterized by peri-epithelial lymphocytic infiltration of the affected tissue or the deposition of the immune complex) and lymphoma.
264,32,"The mechanism underlying the development of SjS is the destruction of the epithelium of the exocrine glands, as a consequence of abnormal B cell and T cell responses to the autoantigens Ro/SSA and La/SSB, among others."
265,32,Diagnostic criteria for SjS include the detection of autoantibodies in patient serum and histological analysis of biopsied salivary gland tissue.
266,32,Therapeutic approaches for SjS include both topical and systemic treatments to manage the sicca and systemic symptoms of disease.
267,32,"SjS is a serious disease with excess mortality, mainly related to the systemic involvement of disease and the development of lymphomas in some patients."
268,32,"Knowledge of SjS has progressed substantially, but this disease is still characterized by sicca symptoms, the systemic involvement of disease, lymphocytic infiltration to exocrine glands, the presence of anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB autoantibodies and the increased risk of lymphoma in patients with SjS."
269,33,"Sjgren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by exocrine glands damage, resulting in the development of dry eyes and dry mouth, as well as extraglandular manifestation."
270,33,It usually starts between the ages of 30 and 50.
271,33,"Late-onset Sjgren's syndrome should be considered as a disease that appears after age 65, but the literature also reports of the age 50, 60, or even 70."
272,33,The prevalence of late-onset Sjgren's syndrome is estimated about 20%.
273,33,The course of late-onset Sjgren's syndrome may differ when compared with patients with a younger onset.
274,33,Lack of sicca symptoms and marker antibodies may be associated with a delay in Sjgren's syndrome diagnosis.
275,33,"Particularly in the elderly, the occurrence of sicca symptoms may be considered as age-related and medication-related."
276,34,OBJECTIVE: Optimize the diagnosis of pediatric Sjgren's syndrome in children who present with parotitis.
277,34,METHODS: Twenty children presented to a pediatric otolaryngology or rheumatology clinic with recurrent parotitis.
278,34,"Presenting symptoms, serologies, sialendoscopy findings, and minor salivary gland biopsy pathology results were reviewed."
279,34,RESULTS: Twenty patients aged 3-17 years presented with recurrent parotitis.
280,34,Ten percent of this cohort met the American-European Consensus Group adult diagnostic criteria for Sjgren's syndrome.
281,34,Forty percent of this cohort met diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome when utilizing Bartunkova's proposed pediatric criteria for diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome.
282,34,CONCLUSION: Sjgren's syndrome is surprisingly common in pediatric patients who present with recurrent parotitis.
283,34,Otolaryngologists who treat pediatric parotitis should have a high index of suspicion for Sjgren's syndrome.
284,34,LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.
285,35,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease affecting the salivary and lachrymal glands.
286,35,"The patients complain of symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth, but up to 50% may additionally develop extraglandular manifestations such as arthritis, vasculitis, polyneuropathy, pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial nephritis."
287,35,"Most therapeutic studies on the glandular manifestations of pSS failed to meet their primary endpoints, possibly since many of the patients had already advanced and irreversible disease.In recent years several important advances have been made."
288,35,The role of B and T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of pSS has been identified.
289,35,The disease activity scores ESSDAI and ESSPRI were developed and can now be used as endpoints in therapeutical studies.
290,35,"Since then, numerous promising new drugs, mostly affecting B and T lymphocytes, have been studied in clinical trials."
291,35,"New classification criteria have been proposed, which will be an important tool in making a diagnosis in an early disease stage, in which the glandular function may still be normal."
292,35,"It is very likely therefore, that we will soon have efficient therapies, which will be able to stop the disease progression in an early stage of pSS."
293,36,"Sjogren's syndrome most commonly presents with dry eyes, dry mouth, joint pain and fatigue."
294,36,"However, recurrent aseptic meningitis, reported as the most uncommon initial symptom, was the presenting feature in our case."
295,36,We present the case of a 19-year-old female with recurrent episodes of aseptic meningitis.
296,36,"She presented with fever, headache, vomiting and photophobia."
297,36,Neurological examination showed neck stiffness.
298,36,Fundoscopy was normal.
299,36,"On two previous occasions her cerebrospinal fluid analysis was consistent with meningitis; however, it was normal at this presentation."
300,36,Review of system revealed history of fatigue and sicca symptoms since early childhood.
301,36,Autoimmune workup showed antinuclear antibodies with a titer of 1:400 and positive anti SSA (Ro) antibodies that led to the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome.
302,36,"She responded well to intravenous steroids, followed by oral prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine."
303,36,"To conclude, diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome may also be considered in a patient presenting with recurrent aseptic meningitis."
304,37,One of the main characteristics of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is chronic dysfunction and destruction of the salivary and lacrimal glands; their secretory biofluids should reflect the glandular biological status.
305,37,Saliva is a heterogeneous biofluid comprised of biomolecules and omics constituents that are altered in response to various diseases.
306,37,"Scientific effort has evaluated saliva proteome to diagnose, monitor, and prognosticate pSS."
307,37,"This article reviews the recent advances in salivary proteomics in the context of pSS, highlighting the most significant and promising findings."
308,37,Determining saliva as a credible means of early disease detection could lead to translational advantages and significant clinical opportunities for pSS.
309,38,"Salivary gland (SG) biopsy is a technique broadly applied for the diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), lymphoma accompanying SS, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and IgG4-related disease The most peculiar feature of pSS on biopsy is focal lymphocytic sialadenitis."
310,38,"In the past, several histological scores have been reported in the literature to describe glandular involvement during pSS."
311,38,"However, the variability among centres in reporting glandular scores is one of the rationales behind the development of standardised consensus guidance."
312,38,"SGs as well as lacrimal glands are involved in up to 50% of patients with IgG4-related disease with 3 histopathological hallmarks such as dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis."
313,38,SGs can be also affected by amyloidosis with MSG biopsy being more sensitive than that of rectal mucosa or subcutaneous fat.
314,38,"SG involvement is a rare manifestation during sarcoidosis, and the presence of non-caseating granulomas needs to be differentiated from granulomas of other etiology."
315,38,"This review article provides an overview of normal and pathological SGs in the context of rheumatic diseases, identifying key elements in the tissue as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, useful in the current clinical practice."
316,39,OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy of needle-knife and hydroxychloroquine sulfate in the treatment of dry mouth and eyes symptoms of primary Sjgren's syndrome.
317,39,"METHODS: A total of 60 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 30 cases in each group."
318,39,"In the observation group, needle-knife was used in the range of 2 cm and 2-3 cm below the occipital protuberance, the left and right lateral bone edges of the C(2) spinous process, between and within the range of 1.5-3 cm beside the C(3) and C(4) spinous processes, points between the left and right mandibular angle and the mastoid, the treatment was given 1 time a week for 8 times."
319,39,"The hydroxychloroquine sulfate was applied 0.2 g each time, 2 times daily, 4 weeks as a course and a total of 2 courses in the control group."
320,39,"The changes of salivary flow rate, tear volume, serum immunoglobulin IgG, IgA, IgM contents and Chinese medicine symptom score were observed before and after treatment in the two groups, and the efficacy was evaluated."
321,39,"RESULTS: The total effective rate in the observation group was 86.7% (26/30), which was better than 70.0% (21/30) in the control group (P<0.05)."
322,39,"The salivary flow rates, tear volume, serum IgG contents and Chinese medicine symptom scores in the two groups were significantly improved after treatment (all P<0.05), and the improvement degree in the observation group was better than the control group (all P<0.05)."
323,39,There was no significant difference in IgA and IgM between the two groups and before and after treatment (all P>0.05).
324,39,CONCLUSION: Needle-knife is superior to hydroxychloroquine sulfate in improving dry mouth and eyes symptoms and reducing serum IgG content in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome.
325,40,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that is estimated to affect 35 million people worldwide.
326,40,"Hallmarks of the disease are a loss of salivary and lacrimal gland function as well as lymphocytic infiltration, elevated proinflammatory cytokines, and circulating autoantibodies."
327,40,Patients often experience significant fatigue and a decrease in their quality of life.
328,40,Approximately 30-50% of pSS patients develop extra-glandular manifestations including malignant lymphoma.
329,40,"Although therapeutic approaches for pSS target both dryness and systemic manifestations, effective treatments are limited."
330,40,"However, new therapies targeting specific immune pathways associated with pSS are being developed."
331,40,This review describes current and future targeted therapies against pSS.
332,41,"PURPOSE: To describe the presentation of dry eye in Sjogren's syndrome (SS) in optometric practices, to report on the methodology used in dry eye monitoring and to explore the level of corneal staining versus age and time of disease."
333,41,METHODS: Records of SS patients were reviewed in 6 optometric sites.
334,41,"A standardized abstraction tool was developed to collect data from the records including: health history, medications and symptoms and signs of dry eye."
335,41,The methods of testing symptoms and signs of dry eye were recorded.
336,41,Variables were recorded at each site and collated at the University of Waterloo.
337,41,"The first visit after January 1, 2000 was selected for description in this paper."
338,41,RESULTS: 123 charts were included.
339,41,The average time since diagnosis was 7.2 years 5.1 years.
340,41,Symptoms of dryness were present in 110/123=89.4% of charts.
341,41,Corneal fluorescein staining was present in 96/123=78% of charts.
342,41,MGD was present in 52% of charts.
343,41,There were significant differences in the protocols and grading systems used in these 6 sites.
344,41,Corneal staining levels did not change with greater age or length of disease.
345,41,CONCLUSION: These 123 SS patients presented with a large variation in their symptoms and signs.
346,41,Symptoms of dryness and corneal fluorescein staining were the most commonly recorded presentations.
347,41,There was a great deal of inconsistency in dry eye protocols among offices.
348,41,Future prospective research with standardized testing will contribute to our understanding of the best dry eye protocols for SS patients.
349,42,To evaluate the efficacy and safety of total glucosides of peony (TGP) in adults with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
350,42,"A multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted between March 2012 and July 2014 at ten Chinese hospitals."
351,42,"In total, 320 pSS patients-classified according to the 2002 American-European Consensus Group Criteria-were randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive TGP(600mg, tid) in the TGP group or placebo for 24weeks in the placebo group."
352,42,"Study personnel, investigators, and patients were blinded to the treatment grouping."
353,42,The primary endpoint was the improvement of EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) at week 24.
354,42,"The secondary endpoints were dry eyes/mouth/skin/nose/throat/vagina visual analogue scale (VAS), pain and discomfort VAS, fatigue VAS, mental discomfort VAS, patient global assessment (PGA), EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), Schirmer's test, basal/stimulated salivary flow-rate values, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)."
355,42,All adverse events were recorded during the trial period.
356,42,ESSPRI improved more in the TGP than the placebo group (p<0.001).
357,42,"Dry eyes/throat/vagina VAS, fatigue VAS, mental discomfort VAS, PGA, Schirmer's test, and ESR also improved more in the TGP group than in the placebo group (all p<0.05)."
358,42,Stimulated salivary flow-rate values increased in the TGP group at week 12 but not at week 24.
359,42,Adverse events in TGP group were 10.9%.
360,42,TGP can alleviate some dryness symptoms as well as disease activity in pSS patients over 24weeks.
361,42,TGP was well tolerated by study subjects.
362,42,TGP seems to be an effective and safe treatment for pSS.
363,43,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic and progressive multisystem autoimmune disease typically managed by rheumatologists.
364,43,"Diagnostic delays are common, due in large part to the non-specific and variable nature of SS symptoms and the slow progression of disease."
365,43,"The hallmark characteristics of SS are dry eye and dry mouth, but there are a broad range of other possible symptoms such as joint and muscle pain, skin rashes, chronic dry cough, vaginal dryness, extremity numbness or tingling, and disabling fatigue."
366,43,"Given that dry eye and dry mouth are typically the earliest presenting complaints, eye care clinicians and dental professionals are often the first point of medical contact and can provide critical collaboration with rheumatologists to facilitate both timely diagnosis and ongoing care of patients with SS."
367,43,"Current diagnostic criteria advocated by the American College of Rheumatology are predicated on the presence of signs/symptoms suggestive of SS along with at least two objective factors such as traditional biomarker positivity, salivary gland biopsy findings, and/or presence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca."
368,43,"Traditional biomarkers for SS include the autoantibodies anti-Sjgren's syndrome-related antigen A (SS-A/Ro), anti-Sjgren's syndrome-related antigen B (SS-B/La), antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers, and rheumatoid factor (RF)."
369,43,"While diagnostically useful, these biomarkers have low specificity for SS and are not always positive, especially in early cases of SS."
370,43,"Several newly-identified biomarkers for SS include autoantibodies to proteins specific to the salivary and lacrimal glands [SP-1 (salivary gland protein-1), PSP (parotid secretory protein), CA-6 (carbonic anhydrase VI)]."
371,43,Data suggest that these novel biomarkers may appear earlier in the course of disease and are often identified in cases that test negative to traditional biomarkers.
372,43,"The Sj() test is a commercially available diagnostic panel that incorporates testing for traditional SS biomarkers (anti-SS-A/Ro, anti-SS-B/La, ANA, and RF), as well as three novel, proprietary early biomarkers (antibodies to SP-1, PSP, and CA-6) which provide greater sensitivity and specificity than traditional biomarker testing alone."
373,43,"Timely diagnosis of SS requires appropriate clinical vigilance for potential SS symptoms, referral and collaborative communication among rheumatology, ophthalmology, and oral care professions, and proactive differential work-up that includes both physical and laboratory evaluations."
374,44,"Dry eye and dry mouth symptoms are each reported by up to 30% of persons more than 65years of age, particularly in women."
375,44,Medication side effects are the most common contributing factors.
376,44,The evaluation of these symptoms requires measures of ocular and oral dryness.
377,44,Sjgren syndrome is the prototypical disease associated with dryness of the eyes and mouth and predominantly affects women in their perimenopausal and postmenopausal years.
378,44,"In addition to topical treatment of the mucosal dryness, patients with Sjgren syndrome may require treatment with systemic immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents to manage a variety of extraglandular manifestations."
379,45,OBJECTIVE: To develop a disease activity index for patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS): the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI).
380,45,"METHODS: Thirty-nine SS experts participated in an international collaboration, promoted by EULAR, to develop the ESSDAI."
381,45,Experts identified 12 organ-specific 'domains' contributing to disease activity.
382,45,"For each domain, features of disease activity were classified in three or four levels according to their severity."
383,45,Data abstracted from 96 patients with systemic complications of primary SS were used to generate 702 realistic vignettes for which all possible systemic complications were represented.
384,45,"Using the 0-10 physician global assessment (PhGA) scale, each expert scored the disease activity of five patient profiles and 20 realistic vignettes."
385,45,"Multiple regression modelling, with PhGA used as the dependent variable, was used to estimate the weight of each domain."
386,45,"RESULTS: All 12 domains were significantly associated with disease activity in the multivariate model, domain weights ranged from 1 to 6."
387,45,"The ESSDAI scores varied from 2 to 47 and were significantly correlated with PhGA for both real patient profiles and realistic vignettes (r=0.61 and r=0.58, respectively, p<0.001)."
388,45,"Compared with 57 (59.4%) of the real patient profiles, 468 (66.7%) of the realistic vignettes were considered likely or very likely to be true."
389,45,CONCLUSIONS: The ESSDAI is a clinical index designed to measure disease activity in patients with primary SS.
390,45,"Once validated, such a standardised evaluation of primary SS should facilitate clinical research and be helpful as an outcome measure in clinical trials."
391,46,Primary Sjgren's syndrome is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that causes destruction of lacrimal and salivary glands.
392,46,The most common and earliest symptoms are oral and ocular dryness.
393,46,"Dry mouth makes talking difficult, tasting and chewing properly, impairing quality of life of these patients."
394,46,"The most common oral signs and symptoms are hyposialia with or without xerostomia, tooth decay, fungal infections, traumatic oral lesions, dysphagia, dysgeusia, and inflammation of salivary glands."
395,46,"There are different therapeutic strategies, depending on the severity of each case, and the increase in the amount of saliva, to reduce the number of cavities and oral infections."
396,46,"It is particularly important to establish a close relationship between the dentist and the rheumatologist in order to make an early and correct diagnosis, promoting appropriate dietary and hygiene measures, as well as to treat and prevent potential oral complications."
397,47,"Juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (jSLE), mixed connective tissue disease (jMCTD), and Sjgren syndrome (jSS) are systemic autoimmune and inflammatory disorders with distinct patterns of organ involvement."
398,47,"All are characterized by autoantibody formation, with antinuclear (ANA) and anti-double-stranded DNA common in jSLE, ANA with high-titer ribonucleoprotein antibody in jMCTD, and Sjgren syndrome A and Sjgren syndrome B antibodies + ANA in jSS."
399,47,"Recognition, monitoring, and management for primary care providers are discussed, focusing on the role of primary physicians in recognizing and helping maintain optimal health in children with these potentially life-threatening diseases."
400,48,There are approximately 4 million Americans diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome.
401,48,"This article discusses the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostics, and implications for home care clinicians who may encounter patients with this syndrome."
402,48,"Chronic pain is discussed as well as interventions to manage symptoms such fatigue, dry eyes mouth and skin."
403,49,AIM: This study aimed to retrospectively describe 15 new primary Sjgren's syndrome-pulmonary arterial hypertension (pSS-PAH) cases confirmed by right heart catheterization (RHC).
404,49,Demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed and risk factors for PAH in pSS were explored.
405,49,METHOD: We retrospectively described 15 new pSS-PAH cases confirmed by RHC referred to our institution between January 2013 and March 2018.
406,49,"We present PAH and pSS characteristics, hemodynamic evaluations, medical management, and outcomes."
407,49,A matched case control study was carried out to determine the risk factors of PAH in pSS compared with pSS-non-PAH patients.
408,49,RESULTS: All patients were female with a mean age at PAH diagnosis of 52.914.6years.
409,49,The delay between the first symptom and PAH diagnosis was 18.719.7months.
410,49,The most common primary manifestation at PAH onset was exertional dyspnea (13/15).
411,49,"At diagnosis of PAH, PAH was severe with a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 48.813.7mmHg (range, 27-72mmHg) and a mean cardiac index of 2.30.6L/min/m(2) (range, 1.47-3.41L/min/m(2) )."
412,49,"Compared with the pSS-PAH without pericardial effusion, pSS-PAH with pericardial effusion had larger right arterial (53 [45-56.75] vs 38 [35.5-46.5], P=.018) and right ventricular sizes (47 [42.75-51.25] vs 36 [32.5-41], P=.007)."
413,49,"Compared with the pSS non-PAH group, we identified 2 risk factors for PAH in pSS: pericardial effusion (odds ratio [OR] [95% CI], 14.29 [1.14-166.67], P=.039) and liver involvement (OR [95% CI], 14.71 [1.14-166.67], P=.035)."
414,49,"CONCLUSION: For pSS patients, PAH can be the first manifestation."
415,49,"We believe that systemic evaluation, especially in patients with pericardial effusion and liver involvement, is important to identify high-risk patients for PAH, improving their prognosis."
416,50,BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren's syndrome is the second most common rheumatological disorder after rheumatoid arthritis.
417,50,It typically presents as xerophthalmia and xerostomia in postmenopausal women.
418,50,"Involvement of the central nervous system has been recognized, although its pathogenesis and characteristics are poorly understood."
419,50,Central nervous system complications are a diagnostic challenge and emphasize the need for systematic screening of patients with new peripheral and central neurological symptoms.
420,50,CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 58-year-old Swiss woman presenting with rapidly progressive sensorimotor distal polyneuropathy together with new-onset generalized seizures.
421,50,"Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain performed after the first seizure showed multiple, bihemispheric, confluent white matter hyperintensities with contrast enhancement."
422,50,Follow-up imaging 3 days after the initial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a fulminant disease progression associated with the serious clinical deterioration of the patient.
423,50,"In light of the results of a minor salivary gland biopsy, autoantibody testing, nerve conduction studies, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging, primary Sjgren's syndrome with cryoglobulinemia type II was diagnosed."
424,50,Response to plasmapheresis and subsequent administration of cyclophosphamide was favorable.
425,50,"CONCLUSION: Even though exocrinopathy is the hallmark of Sjgren's syndrome, systemic symptoms are observed in one-third of patients."
426,50,There is an urgent need to better characterize the mechanisms underlying different disease phenotypes and to perform randomized controlled trials in order to provide tailored and evidence-based treatment for primary Sjgren's syndrome.
427,51,A neutered male Golden Retriever was referred with a 2-week history of dry mouth.
428,51,Multiple and bilateral enlargement of the lacrimal and salivary glands showing heterogeneous internal enhancement was identified on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT).
429,51,"Ultrasonographic examination detected multifocal hypoechoic areas within the swollen submandibular salivary glands, which were histopathologically diagnosed as lymphoplasmacytic sialoadenitis."
430,51,"As both imaging and histopathological findings were in accordance with those in human Sjgren's syndrome, a provisional diagnosis of Sjgren's-like syndrome was made."
431,51,"Immunosuppressive drugs promptly improved clinical signs concurrently with the abnormal sonographic findings, indicating the feasibility of ultrasonography in monitoring therapeutic outcomes."
432,51,"Herein, we discuss a proposed criteria set for diagnosis of Sjgren's-like syndrome in veterinary medicine."
433,52,Primary Sjgren syndrome (PSS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease.
434,52,Interstitial lung disease (ILD) can be an extraglandular complication.
435,52,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with PSS with ILD.
436,52,METHODS: Multicentre cohort study with 25 patients diagnosed with PSS and ILD.
437,52,"Data of PSS, prognostic factors, pulmonary involvement variables, complementary tests that suggest a worse diagnosis and treatment given were collected."
438,52,EULAR index was measured for Sjgren's syndrome.
439,52,RESULTS: We identified 25 patients.
440,52,In 15/25 the diagnosis of ILD was done before the diagnosis of PSS.
441,52,"The histopathological patterns found were: 12 NSIP, 5 UIP, 4 OP, 2 LIP."
442,52,PFRs showed restrictive pattern.
443,52,"The majority of the patients received glucocorticoid therapy, antimalarial or immunosuppressive treatment."
444,52,CONCLUSIONS: Patients affected with PSS must be screened to catch a precocious diagnosis of ILD.
445,52,The majority of the patients were diagnosed of ILD before being diagnosed of PSS.
446,52,Multicenter cohorts are increasingly demanded and a multidisciplinary management is needed.
447,53,A 31-year-old woman experienced tetany and was diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis and hypoparathyroidism.
448,53,"At 33 years of age, her renal function gradually decreased."
449,53,"At 39 years of age, she moved to our hospital and was diagnosed with tubulointerstitial nephritis by renal biopsy."
450,53,"Simultaneously, she was diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome by autoantibodies and salivary gland biopsy."
451,53,"At 40 years of age, based on hypoglycaemia and eosinophilia, she was suspected of adrenal insufficiency, and was diagnosed with primary adrenal insufficiency by both corticotropin stimulation and corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test."
452,53,"She was diagnosed as autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) (Hashimoto thyroiditis and possible primary adrenal insufficiency) as well as primary hypoparathyroidism and Sjgren's syndrome, which are very rarely complicated in APS-2."
453,53,"Therefore, in this patient, it was helpful to pay attention for new onset of other autoimmune diseases."
454,54,Salivary gland ultrasonography (US) has recently been re-discovered as a useful tool to assess salivary gland involvement in primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
455,54,"In this review, we discuss US of the major salivary glands in the diagnosis of primary SS and analyse the possible added value of inclusion in classification criteria."
456,54,"We review the literature concerning associations between US of the major salivary glands, salivary gland histology and serology, with the possibility that US may be of value in disease stratification."
457,54,We also examine the possible utility for US to monitor patient response to therapy in both clinical research and standard clinical care.
458,55,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that mainly targets the exocrine glands.
459,55,"The disease overwhelmingly affects women around 30-60 years old, and more than 95% of patients present with oral and/or ocular dryness, although they may also develop a wide number of organ-specific systemic manifestations."
460,55,The variable presentation is often linked to the influence of multiple personal determinants.
461,55,"In this review, we analyse the main geoepidemiological, immunological and histopathological determinants involved in the phenotypic expression of SS."
462,55,"With respect to sicca involvement, some patients (Asian, young-onset diagnosis, males and Ro-carriers) present with a less pronounced involvement in contrast to others with more pronounced dryness (seronegative, isolated La-carriers)."
463,55,"With respect to the risk of developing systemic disease/poor outcomes, we propose a phenotypic-driven prognostic classification into patients at low risk (elderly-onset diagnosis, seronegative, isolated La-carriers), moderate risk (Black/African-american, young-onset diagnosis, Ro-carriers) and high risk (males, high focus score or presence of germinal centers in histopathological studies, RF-carriers, cryoglobulinaemic and hypocomplementaemic patients)."
464,55,"Phenotype-based clustering of systemic autoimmune diseases may help physicians to offer a more personalised, cost-effective medical care of patients affected by these complex chronic diseases."
465,56,"OBJECTIVES: To define disease activity levels, minimal clinically important improvement (MCII) and patient-acceptable symptom state (PASS) with the primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) disease activity indexes: European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) SS disease activity index (ESSDAI) and EULAR SS patient-reported index (ESSPRI)."
466,56,"METHODS: For 790 patients from two large prospective cohorts, ESSDAI, physician evaluation of disease activity, ESSPRI and patients' satisfaction with their current health status were recorded."
467,56,Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses and anchoring methods were used to estimate disease activity levels of ESSDAI and the PASS of ESSPRI.
468,56,"At follow-up visit, patients and physicians assessed, respectively, whether symptoms and disease activity have improved or not."
469,56,An anchoring method based on this evaluation was used to estimate MCII of ESSDAI and ESSPRI.
470,56,"RESULTS: Low-activity (ESSDAI<5), moderate-activity (5ESSDAI13) and high-activity (ESSDAI14) levels were defined."
471,56,MCII of ESSDAI was defined as an improvement of at least three points.
472,56,The PASS estimate was defined as an ESSPRI<5 points and MCII as a decrease of at least one point or 15%.
473,56,"CONCLUSIONS: This study determined disease activity levels, PASS and MCII of ESSDAI and ESSPRI."
474,56,These results will help designing future clinical trials in SS.
475,56,"For evaluating systemic complications, the proposal is to include patients with moderate activity (ESSDAI5) and define response to treatment as an improvement of ESSDAI at least three points."
476,56,"For addressing patient-reported outcomes, inclusion of patients with unsatisfactory symptom state (ESSPRI5) and defining response as an improvement of ESSPRI at least one point or 15% seems reasonable."
477,57,IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) has emerged as a new entity in the last decade.
478,57,It comprises numerous conditions previously thought to be unrelated.
479,57,"Macroscopically, these diseases cause diffuse organ swelling and formation of pseudotumorous masses."
480,57,"Histopathologically, they are characterized by a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with increased IgG4+ plasma cells and storiform fibrosis."
481,57,"Despite rapid progress within the last years, our knowledge on these conditions is still fragmented."
482,57,"To date, more than forty organs have been reported to be included in IgG4-RD, and salivary gland involvement is amongst the most common organs affected [IgG4-related sialadenitis (IgG4-RS)]."
483,57,"Interestingly, IgG4-RS shares commonalities with Sjgren's syndrome (SS), like glandular enlargement, sicca symptoms, arthralgias, hypergammaglobulinemia, hypocomplementemia, and circulating antinuclear antibodies."
484,57,"Nonetheless, they differ in that the incidence of anti-Ro and anti-La reactivity is not frequently found in patients with IgG4-RS, their salivary glands are infiltrated by a large number of IgG4+ plasma cells and IgG4-RS symptoms respond promptly to steroids."
485,57,"The aim of this review was to describe the clinical, serological, histopathological and pathophysiological aspects of IgG4-RS in the context of IgG4-RD and highlight the differences between IgG4-RS and SS."
486,58,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is one of the most frequent autoimmune systemic diseases, mainly characterized by ocular and oral dryness due to the progressive destruction of lachrymal and salivary glands by an inflammatory process."
487,58,"A noteworthy proportion of patients also features extraglandular manifestations, sometimes severe and life-threatening."
488,58,"Until now, its management relies mostly on symptomatic interventions, long-term monitoring, and, in patients with severe systemic complications, immunosuppressive drugs can be provided."
489,58,"However, recent years have seen great progresses in the understanding of the pathological processes of the disease."
490,58,"The central role of regulatory lymphocytes, the implication of the type 1 interferon pathway in some patients or the importance of epigenetics have been highlighted."
491,58,"New classification criteria have been recently published and have shed in light an international attempt for a better recognition of the patients, probably thanks to the development of new diagnostic procedures such as salivary gland ultrasonography."
492,58,"To facilitate the detection of treatment efficacy in clinical trials and to help in determining which subgroups of patients would have benefits from intensive therapies, a better definition of activity scores and the availability of new prognostic markers are urgent."
493,58,"Thereby, the development of future therapies should be based on specific molecular signatures that will enable a personalized management of each patient."
494,58,"This review focuses on the most striking advances in the fields of pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of pSS, which generate a great hope for pSS patients."
495,59,Primary Sjgren's Syndrome - News on Diagnostics and Therapy Abstract.
496,59,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease that affects primarily the exocrine glands and is mainly characterized by sicca symptoms of the eyes and mouth, but also nose, throat, vagina and skin can be affected."
497,59,Fatigue and pain are also very characteristic.
498,59,"Systemic manifestations can occur, e.g."
499,59,"in joints, muscles, lungs, kidneys, skin or the nervous system."
500,59,"A feared complication is the development of a lymphoma, the risk being especially high in case of positive anti-SSA-(Ro) antibodies, but also in case of a high ESSDAI score, hypocomplementemia, cytopenia or evidence of ectopic germinal centers in salivary gland biopsies."
501,59,Diagnosis is principally made by verification of sicca symptoms (e.g.
502,59,Schirmer's test) and detection of typical antibodies or a typical gland biopsy.
503,59,Sicca symptoms are primarily treated symptomatically (e.g.
504,59,artificial tears or saliva).
505,59,"In case of systemic manifestations glucocorticoids, conventional DMARDs or biologics (mostly rituximab) are treatment options."
506,59,"In severe cases, intravenous immunoglobulins or plasma exchange may be required."
507,60,"In rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, cardiovascular disease is frequently one of the leading causes of mortality or morbidity."
508,60,"Studies have shown that acute systemic inflammation and chronic systemic vasculitis are associated with endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic plaque formation, subsequently leading to cardiovascular disease."
509,60,This meta-analysis aimed to explore the association of subclinical atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness in primary Sjogren's syndrome.
510,60,A comprehensive search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases was performed from date of inception through August 2017.
511,60,"The inclusion criterion was observational studies evaluating the association between primary Sjogren's syndrome, subclinical atherosclerosis, and arterial stiffness by measuring pulse wave velocity (PWV) and intima-media thickness (IMT)."
512,60,Definitions of PSS and methods to assess PWV and IMT were recorded for each study.
513,60,"Different locations of IMT were evaluated including common carotid, internal carotid, and femoral arteries."
514,60,The pooled mean difference (MD) of PWV and IMT and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect meta-analysis.
515,60,The between-study heterogeneity of effect size was quantified using the Q statistic and I(2).
516,60,Data were extracted from eight observational studies involving 767 subjects.
517,60,Pooled result demonstrated a significant increase in PWV in patients who have PSS compared with controls (MD=1.30m/s; 95% CI 0.48-2.12; p value=0.002; I(2)=85%).
518,60,Patients with PSS also have higher IMT (MD=0.08mm; 95% CI 0.04-0.11; p value<0.01; I(2)=72%).
519,60,Our study suggests that PSS is associated with arterial stiffness and subclinical atherosclerosis.
520,60,"Further studies need to be conducted to find the correlation of subclinical atherosclerosis in PSS with the cardiovascular event, the pathophysiological changes of arterial stiffness in PSS, and the benefit of statins, because controlling cardiovascular risk factors or disease activity could potentially help avoid progression of atherosclerosis to overt cardiovascular disease."
521,61,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that presents with sicca symptoms of the main mucosal surfaces.
522,61,"Patients with pSS have a broad spectrum of laboratory features, such as cytopenias and hypergammaglobulinemia."
523,61,"Although hematological abnormalities are usually seen in pSS patients, agranulocytosis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) are rare."
524,61,Here we describe a 40-year-old woman with pSS who developed both agranulocytosis and mixed-type AIHA.
525,61,An increased risk of malignancies has also been reported in pSS patients with hematological changes.
526,61,"Although there is no evidence of malignancies, this patient should be closely followed up in case of developing lymphoma."
527,62,"BACKGROUND: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a frequent manifestation of Sjgren's syndrome (SS), an autoimmune disease of salivary and lacrimal glands, and affects approximately 20% of patients."
528,62,"No clinical or serological features appear to be useful to predict its presence, severity or progression, and chest high-resolution computed tomography (CT) remains the gold standard for diagnosis."
529,62,"Semiquantitative CT (SQCT) based on visual assessment (Goh and Taouli scoring) can estimate ILD extent, although it is burdened by relevant intra- and interobserver variability."
530,62,Quantitative chest CT (QCT) is a promising alternative modality to assess ILD severity.
531,62,AIM: To determine whether QCT assessment can identify extensive or limited lung disease in patients with SS and ILD.
532,62,"METHODS: This multi-center, cross-sectional and retrospective study enrolled patients with SS and a chest CT scan."
533,62,SQCT assessment was carried out in a blinded and centralized manner to calculate both Goh and Taouli scores.
534,62,An operator-independent analysis of all CT scans with the open-source software platform Horos was used to evaluate the QCT indices.
535,62,Patients were classified according to the extent of ILD and differences in QCT index distribution were investigated with non-parametric tests.
536,62,"RESULTS: From a total of 102 consecutive patients with SS, the prevalence of ILD was 35.3% (36/102)."
537,62,There was a statistically significant difference in QCT index distribution between the SS with ILD and SS without ILD groups (p<0.001).
538,62,"Moreover, SS-ILD patients with ILD >20% (by Goh score) had a QCT index statistically different from those with limited ILD extent (p<0.001)."
539,62,"Finally, QCT indices showed a moderate-to-good correlation with the Goh and Taouli scores (from 0.44 to 0.65; p<0.001)."
540,62,CONCLUSIONS: QCT indices can identify patients with SS and ILD and discriminate those with lesser or greater lung disease.
541,63,"OBJECTIVE: Juvenile Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a rare, poorly defined, and possibly underdiagnosed condition affecting children and adolescents."
542,63,The aim of this study was to characterize symptoms and clinical findings of juvenile SS and to explore the clinical application of major salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) in patients with juvenile SS.
543,63,METHODS: A cross-sectional multicenter study recruited patients with disease onset until age 18 years (n = 67).
544,63,"Disease characteristics were recorded, and unstimulated whole sialometry and SGUS examination of the parotid and submandibular salivary glands were performed."
545,63,RESULTS: The female:male ratio was 58:9.
546,63,The mean age at first symptom was 10.2 years and 12.1 years at diagnosis.
547,63,"Ocular and oral symptoms were noted in 42 of 67 patients (63%) and 53 of 66 patients (80%), respectively."
548,63,The American-European Consensus Group or American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for primary SS were fulfilled by 42 of 67 patients (63%).
549,63,Pathologic SGUS findings were observed in 41 of 67 patients (61%); 26 of 41 SGUS+ patients (63%) fulfilled primary SS criteria.
550,63,Salivary gland enlargements/parotitis were noted in 37 of 58 patients and were nonsignificantly associated with SGUS+ status (P = 0.066).
551,63,The mean levels of saliva were 5.6 ml/15 minutes in SGUS- patients compared to 3.3 ml/15 minutes in the SGUS+ patients (P = 0.049).
552,63,A total of 36 of 41 SGUS+ patients (88%) were anti-Ro/La+ compared to 14 of 26 SGUS- patients (54%) (P = 0.001).
553,63,"In addition, 24 of 39 SGUS+ patients (62%) were positive for rheumatoid factor (RF), whereas only 5 of 25 SGUS- patients (20%) were RF+ (P = 0.001)."
554,63,CONCLUSION: Juvenile SS is characterized by a large spectrum of clinical symptoms and findings.
555,63,"Several glandular and extraglandular parameters such as hyposalivation, swollen salivary glands, and autoantibodies are associated with pathologic SGUS findings."
556,64,BACKGROUND: Investigation of morphological differences in relation with serological variables between primary versus secondary Sjgren's syndrome associated with systemic scleroderma (Scl-SS).
557,64,MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 69 primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and Scl-SS patients were grouped according to the American-European Consensus Group criteria.
558,64,Serum autoantibody information was obtained from the patient records.
559,64,"Hematoxylin and eosin sections of the minor salivary gland biopsy were reevaluated, and the lymphocyte focus score (FS), plasma cell focus, and fibrosis rates were all evaluated."
560,64,RESULTS: There were 43 pSS and 26 Scl-SS cases.
561,64,Both biopsy and autoantibody were positive in 16 pSS cases while only biopsy was positive in 25 cases and only antibody in 1 case.
562,64,Both biopsy and antibody were positive in 5 Scl-SS cases while only biopsy was positive in 18 and only antibody in 3 cases.
563,64,The plasma cell focus was statistically significantly higher in pSS cases (P = 0.003).
564,64,"No difference was seen between Sjgren' syndrome (SS) subtypes in terms of lymphocyte FS, fibrosis, and autoantibody positivity."
565,64,CONCLUSION: We found that plasma cell focuses could be found more frequently in pSS than Scl-SS.
566,64,"In addition, our study reveals that the coexistence of SS and systemic scleroderma decreases the incidence of FS value 1 compared to pSS."
567,65,Neurological manifestations are reported as a consequence of primary Sjgren syndrome (PSS).
568,65,Any part of the brain and peripheral nervous system can be involved in PSS.
569,65,"However, cerebellar degeneration and atrophy associated with PSS have been rarely reported."
570,65,"Our report describes a 22-year-old woman who presented with cerebellar ataxia, arthritis and arthralgia."
571,65,"Evaluation of her symptoms, autoantibodies and salivary gland pathology was in favour of the diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome."
572,65,"Also, her brain MRI revealed cerebellar degeneration."
573,65,There are only four patients reported to be affected by cerebellar atrophy associated with PSS.
574,65,Administration of high doses of methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide leads to substantial improvement in the cerebellar symptoms of this case.
575,65,"In addition, after 2months of follow-up, the patient's ataxia recovered significantly."
576,65,"It could be concluded that in addition to neurological degenerative disorders, in some cases cerebellar atrophy could also be associated with autoimmune conditions such as PSS."
577,66,"OBJECTIVE: In the 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), pre-existing lymphoma is not an exclusion criterion for pSS diagnosis, as in earlier criteria."
578,66,We aimed to explore whether there are differences between pSS patients with and without pre-existing lymphoma at pSS diagnosis.
579,66,METHOD: Patients with ICD-7-10 codes for Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma before or after SS diagnosis were identified by linking the Swedish Patient Register 1964-2007 with the Cancer Register 1990-2007 (n=224).
580,66,Clinical data were collected from medical records.
581,66,Lymphoma diagnoses were evaluated by tissue review.
582,66,Characteristics of pSS patients with and without pre-existing lymphoma were compared.
583,66,RESULTS: We identified 107 patients with pSS as the reason for an SS diagnosis code and a verified lymphoma.
584,66,"Of these, 18 (17%) had a pre-existing lymphoma at pSS diagnosis, defined as lymphoma diagnosed before or within 6months of pSS diagnosis."
585,66,"Male gender (39% vs 10%, p=0.006), enlarged lymph nodes during the pSS disease (61% vs 27%, p=0.01), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (50% vs 22%, p=0.02), and salivary gland lymphoma (61% vs 26%, p=0.006) were more common in patients with a pre-existing lymphoma at pSS diagnosis."
586,66,Other pSS characteristics were similar.
587,66,"CONCLUSION: In a substantial proportion of patients, particularly in men, pSS remains undiagnosed until after lymphoma diagnosis."
588,66,"The study highlights the importance of pSS investigation in patients with lymphoma, especially MALT lymphoma, in the salivary glands."
589,67,"The 11th International Symposium for Sjogren's syndrome was held in Athens, Greece in September 2011."
590,67,This symposia is part of a long series of meetings that have attempted to meet the needs of both scientists and physicians in improving the healthcare of their patients with Sjogren's syndrome.
591,67,Sjogren's syndrome affects almost 0.5% of the general population and is second only to rheumatoid arthritis amongst the systemic autoimmune diseases.
592,67,"More importantly, it has daily implications for the millions of sufferers around the world."
593,67,"The goal of this meeting, which included nearly 200 abstracts and invited lectures, was to address the critical needs in the clinical practice of Sjogren's syndrome."
594,67,This volume is a composite of select papers that were presented at this meeting and attempts to provide a critical overview of clinical and basic science.
595,67,"The volume includes a variety of themes and, importantly, raises issues that are still unresolved but which are important in our future diagnostic and therapeutic efforts."
596,68,OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to assess the pathological sonoelastographic changes in the major salivary glands and to demonstrate the diagnostic effectiveness of Sonoelastography as an additional method to US in Sjgren's syndrome.
597,68,METHODS: Fifty eight patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) were selected according to the American-European Consensus Group Classification criteria.
598,68,Twenty five healthy volunteers involved in this study.
599,68,All patients were evaluated with B-mode and elastography by using Hitachi EUB 7500 digital ultrasound equipment.
600,68,All subjects were female.
601,68,"The sonoelastography examination, which allowed us to assess the elasticity of the parenchyma, was performed and strain ratios were measured by comparing with the adjacent tissues."
602,68,RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between the pSS and control groups for the elastographic scores and strain ratios (p<0.001).
603,68,The highest sensitivity and specificity levels were obtained when the strain ratio cut-off value was taken as 1.55 for the submandibular gland and 2.45 for the parotid gland (sensitivity and specificity were 83% and 88% respectively for the submandibular gland and 83% and 92% respectively for the parotid gland).
604,68,"However, no statistically significant differences were found between the disease duration and the elasticity scores or strain ratios in pSS group (p>0.05)."
605,68,CONCLUSION: US examination is an efficient method to assess major salivary gland involvement in the diagnosis of pSS.
606,68,Sonoelastography is a modality which can contribute to the diagnosis by improving specificity in the differential diagnosis of pSS.
607,68,"Strain ratio measurement, which is a semi-quantitative method, increases the diagnostic effectiveness by providing high sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values."
608,69,"Sjogren syndrome (SS) can occur alone, primary Sjogren syndrome, or in association with other rheumatic diseases, secondary Sjogren syndrome (sSS), such as Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)."
609,69,The occurrence of Sjogren syndrome with RA makes it course worse and increases high morbidity and mortality of RA.
610,69,"In this exploratory study we aim to determine the prevalence of sSS (diagnosed based on the revised version of American-European consensus Group Classification Criteria: AUCG-criteria), sicca symptoms (dry eye, dry mouth), positive autoantibody tests (Anti RO or Anti-LA antibodies), UWSFR (Unstimulated Whole Salivary Flow Rate), Schirmer and Lissamine test."
611,69,"In this cross-sectional study, eighty three consecutive RA patients (according to American College of Rheumatology criteria 1987) who were visited at rheumatology clinic of Razi General Hospital located in the north of Iran entered into our study."
612,69,"Our exclusion criteria was a positive history of past head and neck radiation treatment, Hepatitis C infection, acquired immunodeficiency disease (AIDS), pre-existing lymphoma, sarcoidosis, graft versus host disease, use of anticholinergic drugs (including neuroleptics, antidepressants, antihypertensive and parasympatholytics)."
613,69,They examined with UWSFR by a rheumatologist and with Schirmer test and Lissamine test by an ophthalmologist.
614,69,Participants were 90.4% female with the mean age 48.313 years.
615,69,"Duration of RA was in 36.1% less than 5 years, in 22.9% 5-10 years, in 12.1% 11-15 years and in 28.9% more than 15 years."
616,69,Our results demonstrated that the prevalence of sSS was 5.9% (CI:0.6%-10.5%).
617,69,Number of 27.7% of RA patients positively responded to at least one question about sicca symptoms.
618,69,"Among objective tests, only Positive UWSFR and Lissamine test were significantly more common in RA patients with sSS in comparison to ones without sSS (P<0.001, P=0.01 respectively)."
619,69,"In RA patients, we found a linear trend between sicca symptoms and aging (P=0.02)."
620,69,"In patients with sicca symptoms, among tests that used for assessing decrease in saliva or tear production, only USWFR significantly more common (P=0.01)."
621,69,IN CONCLUSION: In RA population in North of Iran prevalence of sSS was less than 10%.
622,69,"In them, a significant linear trend existed between aging and sicca symptoms."
623,69,Among objective tests of AUCG-criteria (except for lip biopsy that was not performed in the current study) only UWSFR and Lissamine test were significantly more common in patients with sSS in comparison ones without it.
624,70,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the value of micro ribonucleic acid-146a (miR-146a) and miR-4484 expressions in the diagnosis of anti-SSA antibody positive Sjogren syndrome (SS) and their correlations with prognosis.
625,70,"PATIENTS AND METHODS: 70 patients with anti-SSA antibody positive SS were selected as the observation group, and the non-positive Sjogren syndrome (PSS) subjects were collected as the control group at the same time."
626,70,Fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to detect serum expressions of miR-146a and miR-4484 in two groups.
627,70,Expression changes of miR-146a and miR-4484 in patients before and after treatment were compared.
628,70,"After 3 years of follow-up, 70 patients were divided into high expression and low expression subgroups based on the average expressions of miR-146a and miR-4484."
629,70,Prognosis in each subgroup was compared.
630,70,RESULTS: The expressions of miR-146a and miR-4484 in the observation group were significantly up-regulated compared with those in the control group (p<0.05).
631,70,"After treatment, the expressions of miR-146a and miR-4484 were significantly down-regulated compared with those before treatment (p<0.05)."
632,70,Combined detection of miR-146a and miR-4484 was superior to single index detection in the diagnosis and prognosis of PSS (p<0.05).
633,70,The 3-year follow-up showed that the incidences of renal injury and pulmonary interstitial lesion in patients with low miR-146a and miR-4484 expressions were significantly lower than those with high expressions (p<0.05).
634,70,"However, there were no significant differences in the survival rate between the two groups (p>0.05)."
635,70,CONCLUSIONS: Serum expressions of miR-146a and miR-4484 in anti-SSA antibody positive PSS patients are significantly up-regulated.
636,70,Their detection can improve the diagnostic rate of SS.
637,70,"Expressions of miR-146a and miR-4484 are closely correlated to the prognosis of the patients, which can be used as prognostic predictors."
638,71,Sjgren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by progressive injury to exocrine glands accompanied by diverse extra-glandular manifestations.
639,71,"The spectrum of Sjgren's manifestations expanded in recent years to include new symptoms and signs such as small fibre neuropathy, and also well-defined activity and prognostic indexes."
640,71,"Similar to other non-organ-specific autoimmune diseases, a mosaic of factors have been linked with the development and appearances of Sjgren's syndrome."
641,71,"Progress has been made unravelling those factors, including susceptibility genes, immunological parameters and various environmental factors in the last decade, some of which may enable targeted therapies, biological and non-biological ones, for patients suffering from this disease."
642,71,"Thus, herein we review the postulated aetiologies, pathogenesis and new insights related to Sjgren's syndrome."
643,72,AIMS: To investigate the prevalence and predictive factors of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in a cohort of patients with burning mouth symptoms.
644,72,METHODS: A total of 125 patients with burning mouth symptoms were enrolled in a prospective study and assessed for the presence of SS.
645,72,The severity of oral symptoms was evaluated by using questionnaires.
646,72,Salivary flow rates and salivary scintigraphy were used to evaluate salivary function.
647,72,"Patient laboratory work-ups were reviewed, and SS was diagnosed by a rheumatologist based on the American-European Consensus Group criteria."
648,72,The differences between the SS patient group and the non-SS patient group were analyzed with chi-square test or t test.
649,72,"RESULTS: A total of 12 of the 125 enrolled patients (9.5%) had a positive autoimmune antibody test, and 6 (4.8% of the entire cohort) had SS (4 [3.2%] primary and 2 [1.6%] secondary)."
650,72,"Patients with SS exhibited significantly decreased hemoglobin levels, an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and an increased prevalence of autoantibody positive results compared to non-SS patients."
651,72,Salivary scintigraphy showed that the uptake ratio of the submandibular gland in SS patients was decreased significantly.
652,72,CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SS in patients with burning mouth symptoms was 4.8%.
653,72,"Therefore, clinicians who treat patients with burning mouth symptoms should evaluate laboratory findings and salivary functions to identify patients with SS."
654,73,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease, characterized by chronic inflammation of exocrine glands that results in development of xerostomia and keratoconjunctivitis sicca."
655,73,"The disease activity of SS is not restricted to exocrine glands, and many other organs and organ systems can be involved."
656,73,"Diagnosis of SS in the elderly population can be challenging because xerostomia, dry eyes, symptoms of fatigue, weight loss and muscle pain are also common features of old age."
657,73,Delay between clinical onset and diagnosis of SS in the elderly may be due to the shared features of SS and old age.
658,73,"The 2002 revised American-European Consensus Group (AECG) classification criteria for SS are the preferred tool used to confirm diagnosis of SS, but recently alternative criteria have been put forward by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)."
659,73,"The AECG criteria set combines subjective symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth with objective signs of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, salivary gland dysfunction and histopathological (salivary gland biopsy) and serological (autoantibodies against SSA/Ro and SSB/La antigens) features."
660,73,Treatment of SS in the elderly does not differ from that in younger patients.
661,73,"The aims of the treatment of SS are to control glandular and extraglandular manifestations, to prevent damage to organ systems and loss of function, and to decrease morbidity and mortality."
662,73,"Treatment of the elderly can be complicated by co-morbidities, an increased rate of adverse events related to therapeutic agents, and polypharmacy."
663,73,"Therefore, careful follow-up of the treatment is required."
664,74,BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis has manifestations in various organs including ophthalmic involvement.
665,74,The present study evaluates prevalence of dry eye and secondary Sjogren's syndrome using salivary scintigraphy which has not been used in previous reports.
666,74,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of secondary Sjogren's syndrome in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, including clinical characteristics and dry eye, compared with non-Sjogren's syndrome."
667,74,"DESIGN: Descriptive cross sectional study MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixty-one patients with rheumatoid arthritis were recruited at Siriraj Hospital during March 2009-September 2010 and filled in the questionnaires about dry eye for Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) with a history taking of associated diseases, medications, duration of symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth."
668,74,"The Schirmer I test without anesthesia, tear break-up time, rose bengal staining score, severity of keratitis and salivary scintigraphy were measured and analyzed."
669,74,"RESULTS: Prevalence of secondary Sjogren's syndrome and dry eye were 22.2% (95% CI 15.4 to 30.9) and 46.7% (95% CI 38.0 to 55.6), respectively."
670,74,"Dry eye interpreted from OSDI, Schirmer 1 test, tear break-up time and rose bengal staining was 16.4%, 46.7%, 82% and 3.3% respectively."
671,74,"Fifty-two percent of patients had a history of dry eye and dry mouth with mean duration 27.4 and 29.8 months, respectively."
672,74,Superficial punctate keratitis and abnormal salivary scintigraphy were found in 58.2% and 77.8%.
673,74,"Duration of rheumatoid arthritis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate were not correlated with secondary Sjogren's syndrome."
674,74,Dry eye from OSDI with secondary Sjogren's syndrome (33.3%) compared with non-Sjogren's syndrome (9.5%) was significant difference (p = 0.008).
675,74,"Adjusted odds ratio for secondary Sjogren's syndrome in OSDIL score > 25 was 13.8 (95% CI 2.6 to 73.8, p = 0.002) compared to OSDI score < 25."
676,74,CONCLUSION: Awareness and detection of dry eye syndrome and secondary Sjogren's syndrome in rheumatoid arthritis was crucial for evaluation of their severity and proper management.
677,75,OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the procedures for efficiently diagnosing Sjgren's syndrome to reduce patient burden.
678,75,METHODS: This study analyzed data from 254 Japanese patients diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome out of 4967 who visited our clinic complaining of xerostomia.
679,75,"RESULTS: Of the 254 Sjgren's syndrome patients, 140 fulfilled the criteria proposed by the Committee on Sjgren's Syndrome of the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, 228 fulfilled the criteria proposed by the American-European Consensus Group, and 69 fulfilled the criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology."
680,75,Numbers of definitive cases varied with each set of criteria.
681,75,"Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze useful examination items for definitive diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome, demonstrating that anti-Ro/SSA (odds ratio (OR), 7.165), lip biopsy (OR, 4.273), sialography (OR, 2.402), and ANA (OR, 0.678) correlated significantly with definitive diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome."
682,75,CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the following diagnostic procedure for Sjgren's syndrome would reduce burden on patients.
683,75,"When clinicians choose examination items for diagnosing Sjgren's syndrome, they should first select which criteria to use."
684,75,"Then, to minimize the number of examination items, examinations should be performed in order of anti-SSA antibody, lip biopsy, and parotid gland sialography."
685,76,PURPOSE: To determine whether ocular phenotypic features of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) and/or participant-reported symptoms of dry eye disease are associated with depression in women participants enrolled in the Sjgren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA).
686,76,DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
687,76,METHODS: Women enrolled in the SICCA registry from 9 international research sites.
688,76,"Participants met at least 1 of 5 inclusion criteria for registry enrollment (including complaints of dry eyes or dry mouth, a previous diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome (SS), abnormal serology (positive anti-Sjgren syndrome antigen A and/or B [anti-SSA and/or anti-SSB]), or elevated antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor), bilateral parotid gland enlargement, or multiple dental caries)."
689,76,"At baseline, participants had oral, ocular, and rheumatologic examination; blood and saliva collection; and a labial salivary gland biopsy (LSGB)."
690,76,They also completed an interview and questionnaires including assessment of depression with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9).
691,76,"Univariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between depression and demographic characteristics, participant-reported health, phenotypic features of Sjgren syndrome, and participant-reported symptoms."
692,76,"Mixed-effects modeling was performed to determine if phenotypic features of KCS and/or participant-reported symptoms of dry eye disease were associated with depression, controlling for health, age, country or residence, and sex and allowing for nonindependence within geographic site."
693,76,RESULTS: Dry eye complaints produced a 1.82-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38-2.40) higher odds of having depression compared to being symptom-free (P < .001).
694,76,"Additionally, complaints of specific ocular sensations were associated with a higher odds of depression including burning sensation (odds ratio 2.25, 95% CI 1.87-2.72, P < .001) compared to those without complaints."
695,76,"In both women with and without SS, the presence of symptoms of dry eyes and/or dry mouth rather than SS itself resulted in higher odds of depression."
696,76,"One particular ocular phenotypic feature of SS, a positive ocular staining score, was inversely correlated with depression."
697,76,"CONCLUSIONS: Participant-reported eye symptoms, particularly specific ocular sensations such as burning, were found to be positively associated with individual American College of Rheumatology/EUropean League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) SS criteria items."
698,77,BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to investigate nasal and paranasal signs and symptoms of the primary Sjogren`s syndrome patients and compare them with healthy controls.
699,77,"METHODOLOGY: Seventy-seven (7 M, 70 F) primary Sjogren`s syndrome patients and 77 healthy controls were included in the study."
700,77,"Anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, 5 component smell discrimination test, nasal clearance analysis with saccharin test and electrorhinomanometer were performed."
701,77,"RESULTS: Nasal crusting was present in 31 and 24 individuals in patient and control groups, respectively."
702,77,"Sinusitis was present in 2 and 1 individuals in patient and control groups, respectively."
703,77,"Nasal polyposis was present in 7 and 1 individuals in patient and control groups, respectively."
704,77,These differences were not statistically different.
705,77,"CONCLUSION: Although there were some findings in a few patients, nasal findings were insignificant and mild even in patients with severe oral or ocular findings."
706,77,"Rhinomanometry, nasal clearance determination or smell discrimination tests have very little value in the diagnosis or management of primary Sjogren`s syndrome."
707,77,"Nasal polyposis was higher in the patient group, though it did not reach a significant level."
708,77,Nasal glandular involvement is mild and insignificant in primary Sjogren`s syndrome.
709,78,"PURPOSE: Dry Eye Disease (DED) is part of several conditions, including Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and no single test to diagnosis DED."
710,78,The present study intends to evaluate whether a set of signs and symptoms of DED can distinguish: a) SS from other non-overlapping systemic diseases related to DED; b) primary and secondary SS.
711,78,"METHODS: 182 consecutive patients with DED were evaluated under five groups: SS, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Graves' orbitopathy (GO), diabetes mellitus (DM), glaucoma under treatment with benzalkonium chloride medications (BAK)."
712,78,Twenty-four healthy subjects were included as control group (CG).
713,78,"The evaluation consisted of Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), Schirmer test (ST), corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) and tear film break up time (TFBUT)."
714,78,"Indeed, a subset of DED patients (n = 130), classified as SS1, SS2 and nonSS (NSS) by the American-European Criteria were compared."
715,78,Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classified the individuals based on variables collected.
716,78,The area under Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve evaluated the classification performance in both comparisons.
717,78,"RESULTS: Comparing SS with other diseases, QDA showed that the most important variable for classification was OSDI, followed by TFBUT and CFS."
718,78,"Combined, these variables were able to correctly classify 62.6% of subjects in their actual group."
719,78,"At the discretion of the area under the ROC curve, the group with better classification was the control (97.2%), followed by DM (95.5%) and SS (92.5%)."
720,78,"DED tests were different among the NSS, SS1 and SS2 groups."
721,78,The analysis revealed that the combined tests correctly classified 54.6% of the patients in their groups.
722,78,"The area under the ROC curve better classified NSS (79.5%), followed by SS2 (74.4%) and SS1 (69.4%)."
723,78,"CONCLUSIONS: Diseases that causes DED, and also SS1, SS2 and NSS are distinguishable conditions, however a single ocular tools was not able to detect the differences among the respective groups."
724,79,Objective The aim of this study is to assess the subjective and objective aspects of voice in Sjgren's syndrome.
725,79,Methods The study enrolled 10 women with Sjgren's syndrome and 12 healthy women.
726,79,"Maximum phonation time, fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, and noise-to-harmonics ratio were determined during acoustic voice analysis."
727,79,The Stroboscopy Evaluation Rating Form was used for the laryngostroboscopic evaluation.
728,79,A subjective evaluation was performed using the Turkish version of Voice Handicap Index-10.
729,79,"Results The mean age of the Sjgren's syndrome and control groups was 4613.89 and 41.276.99 years, respectively, and did not differ (P=0.131)."
730,79,"In the laryngostroboscopic evaluation, the smoothness and straightness of vocal folds, regularity, and glottal closure differed significantly."
731,79,"In the acoustic and aerodynamic analyses, none of the parameters differed statistically, while the Sjgren's syndrome group had significantly higher Voice Handicap Index-10 scores than the controls."
732,79,Conclusion Sjgren's syndrome affects the voice and voice quality.
733,80,A 31-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital after several episodes of transient numbness in her fingers and dysarthria.
734,80,"No neurological symptoms and signs were observed in this patient on admission; however, blood tests revealed elevated amylase and immunoglobulin G levels, an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and positive anti-Sjgren's-syndrome (SjS)-related antigen A antibodies."
735,80,The cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed a slight increase in the cell count and protein content.
736,80,Diffusion-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images on magnetic resonance imaging showed high-signal-intensity lesions in the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia supplied by the left middle cerebral artery.
737,80,A part of the lesions was enhanced by the administration of gadolinium contrast medium.
738,80,"Magnetic resonance angiography suggested stenosis in the left anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries."
739,80,"The patient was thus diagnosed with acute cerebral infarction and was then treated with argatroban, edaravone, and clopidogrel."
740,80,"Furthermore, Schirmer's test, sialography, and salivary gland biopsy results led to the diagnosis of SjS."
741,80,A nerve conduction study suggested concomitant mild polyneuritis or mononeuritis multiplex.
742,80,"Collectively, we speculate that cerebral arterial stenosis associated with SjS leads to transient ischemic attack-like episodes, transient neurological symptoms and signs, and cerebral infarction."
743,80,"(Received June 13, 2018; Accepted September 11, 2018; Published December 1, 2018)."
744,81,Dry mouth is a common condition presenting to a GP or general dental practitioner.
745,81,"The most common cause of a dry mouth is related to medication use, however patients with Sjgren's syndrome, a multisystem autoimmune condition, may present to their dentist rather than their GP complaining of dry mouth and dry eyes."
746,81,This article explores the causes of dry mouth and how a patient can be investigated to find the cause of their dry mouth.
747,81,"An overview of Sjgren's syndrome, the relevant diagnostic criteria, presenting signs and symptoms, investigations and management principles are outlined."
748,82,"Background: Localized nodular deposits of AL amyloid are seen in different tissues/organs; however, the pathogenesis of this form of amyloidosis remains unclear."
749,82,"Recently, Sjgren syndrome combined with localized nodular AL amyloidosis has been noted."
750,82,"Here, we report Sjgren syndrome cases showing multifocal nodular AL amyloidosis and the followed benign course."
751,82,"Materials and methods: We investigated the clinical pictures and histopathological findings of three cases with both presence of Sjgren syndrome and localized nodular AL amyloidosis, paying a special attention to the distribution of amyloidoma."
752,82,Results: All three cases were middle-aged females.
753,82,In two of three cases localized deposits of AL amyloid preceded Sjgren syndrome.
754,82,"Amyloidoma was detected in scalp, eyelid, cheek, larynx, trachea, lung and breast, and around these amyloid-deposited lesions infiltration of plasma cells was seen."
755,82,"Pulmonary amyloidosis was consistently accompanied with parenchymal cystic lesions, but this amyloidosis did not produce any significant respiratory symptoms."
756,82,Some of large pulmonary amyloidomas showed cavity formation and subsequent shrinkage.
757,82,In two cases amyloid deposition was found on gastric mucosa.
758,82,"Two cases received small doses of oral prednisone, with no further appearance of amyloidoma."
759,82,Conclusion: Sjgren syndrome-related plasma cell disorder may be responsible for the formation of this unique multifocal nodular AL amyloidosis.
760,83,Sjgren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease whose main clinical manifestation is oral dryness (xerostomia) and ocular dryness (xerophthalmia).
761,83,It is characterized by progressive mononuclear infiltration of the exocrine glands and can affect a variety of organ systems.
762,83,"The prevalence of primary Sjgren's syndrome varies from 0.01 up to 4.8%; this variability reflects differences in definition, application of diagnostic criteria, and geographic differences in age groups."
763,83,"The etiology of primary Sjgren's syndrome is unknown, but the interaction between genetic and environmental factors (viruses, hormones, vitamins, stress) is important."
764,83,"There are few reported cases of concordance in monozygotic twins, and it is common for patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome to have relatives with other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis."
765,83,Among the most common findings is hypergammaglobulinemia.
766,83,"Elevated levels of -globulins contain autoantibodies directed against nonspecific antigens such as rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and cellular antigens SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La."
767,83,"Regarding diagnosis, there have been 11 different published criteria for Sjgren's syndrome since 1965; none have been approved by the American College of Rheumatology or the European League Against Rheumatism."
768,83,"The current criteria were published in 2012 jointly with the progressive advance in the knowledge of the human salivary proteome that has gained wide acceptance in Sjgren's syndrome, with the possibility of using saliva as a useful tool in both diagnosis and prognosis in this field because the analysis of salivary proteins may reflect the state of locally underlying disease of the salivary glands, which are the target organs in this disease."
769,84,"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the diagnostic performance of a deep learning system for the detection of Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) in ultrasonography (US) images, and compared it with the performance of inexperienced radiologists."
770,84,METHODS: 100 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SjS according to both the Japanese criteria and American-European Consensus Group criteria and 100 non-SjS patients that had a dry mouth and suspected SjS but were definitively diagnosed as non-SjS were enrolled in this study.
771,84,All the patients underwent US scans of both the parotid glands (PG) and submandibular glands (SMG).
772,84,"The training group consisted of 80 SjS patients and 80 non-SjS patients, whereas the test group consisted of 20 SjS patients and 20 non-SjS patients for deep learning analysis."
773,84,The performance of the deep learning system for diagnosing SjS from the US images was compared with the diagnoses made by three inexperienced radiologists.
774,84,"RESULTS: The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the deep learning system for the PG were 89.5, 90.0 and 89.0%, respectively, and those for the inexperienced radiologists were 76.7, 67.0 and 86.3%, respectively."
775,84,"The deep learning system results for the SMG were 84.0, 81.0 and 87.0%, respectively, and those for the inexperienced radiologists were 72.0, 78.0 and 66.0%, respectively."
776,84,The AUC for the inexperienced radiologists was significantly different from that of the deep learning system.
777,84,CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning system had a high diagnostic ability for SjS.
778,84,This suggests that deep learning could be used for diagnostic support when interpreting US images.
779,85,"Classification criteria provide a formalized approach to studying course and management of rheumatic disease, as well as a measure of improvement in care."
780,85,Understanding the purposes of classification criteria sets and the differences between different classification criteria is crucial for understanding rheumatic disease and for the design and conduct of clinical and epidemiologic investigations.
781,85,"In this article, the similarities and differences between the American-European Consensus Group Criteria (AECG) and the newly proposed American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for Sjgren's syndrome and the clinical implications of switching to the ACR classification criteria from the AECG are described."
782,86,"Conversion disorder (CD) is sometimes accompanied by motor and sensory impairments, such as muscle weakness, paralysis, sensory hypersensitivity, and sensory loss."
783,86,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) complicates 5-10% of cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
784,86,Patients with SS or SLE present with various neurological symptoms and psychiatric manifestations.
785,86,"When neurological symptoms are present, it is important to distinguish whether the symptoms are caused by a neurological or a mental disorder because the former requires early intensive intervention, such as methylprednisolone pulse therapy (MPT), whereas psychotherapy or antidepressant drugs are recommended for mental disorders."
786,86,We noticed SS- and SLE-like symptoms just after a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in a 14-year-old girl.
787,86,"At approximately the same time, paralysis started in her lower limbs and subsequently spread to her upper limbs."
788,86,An examination for neurological symptoms revealed no abnormalities.
789,86,"Because of the conversion reaction between her neurological symptoms and her disease state, CD was suspected as the etiology of her physical symptoms."
790,86,"Nevertheless, because of the progressive nature of the neurological symptoms, MPT was initiated with concurrent administration of intravenous immunoglobulin, but it failed to achieve a good outcome."
791,86,The patient's symptoms eventually improved after she underwent psychotherapy treatment for a few months.
792,86,"Because early diagnosis of the cause of neurological symptoms accompanying SS and SLE is difficult, it may be necessary to combine the two lines of treatment in the early stages."
793,86,"However, when a mental disorder is suspected, psychotherapy should be started early to minimize the use of unnecessary neurological treatment."
794,87,"Sjgren syndrome (SS) is a systemic inflammatory and autoimmune disease characterized by systemic disorders of the exocrine glands, predominantly the salivary and lacrimal glands."
795,87,"Here, we report a 4-year-old boy who presented with the repetition of generalized tonic-clonic seizures for 1-2min."
796,87,"Initially, he was diagnosed with idiopathic autoimmune encephalitis and was treated with steroids."
797,87,"He was eventually diagnosed with SS based on the examination results, such as inflammatory cell infiltration into the minor salivary glands and positive serum anti-SSA/Ro antibody."
798,87,"Although central nervous system complications are rare in pediatric SS, this condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a patient presents with idiopathic autoimmune encephalitis of unknown cause."
799,87,"Furthermore, SS can occur in relatively young children and can present without imaging abnormalities."
800,88,We retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of combined use of salivary gland ultrasonography (US) and the 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatic Disease (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for improving the diagnostic efficiency in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
801,88,A US-based salivary gland disease grading system was developed using a cohort comprising 213 SS or non-SS patients who fulfilled the minimum requirements for classifying SS based on the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and ACR criteria.
802,88,"Using 62 SS or non-SS patients from the 213 patients and who had also undergone all the 5 examinations needed for the ACR/EULAR classification, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of various combinations of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications for diagnosing SS, using the clinical diagnosis of SS by rheumatologists as the gold standard."
803,88,"The ACR/EULAR criteria discriminated clinical SS patients with 77% and 79% accuracy for those with primary or secondary SS and for those with primary SS, respectively."
804,88,"However, the integrated score system of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications yielded 92% and 93% accuracy for these 2 SS patient groups, respectively, provided that US score of 3 was assigned to patients with US grade 2, and then patients with integrated threshold score of 5 were diagnosed as SS."
805,88,"Cross-validation also indicated improved accuracy of the integrated ACR/EULAR and US score system (91.9 and 93.0% for primary/secondary and primary SS patients, respectively) over that by the ACR/EULAR criteria alone."
806,88,"(74.2 and 86.0%, respectively)."
807,88,The integrated ACR/EULAR and US scoring system can improve the diagnosis of patients with clinical SS.
808,89,BACKGROUND: Distal renal tubular acidosis is a relatively infrequent condition with complex pathophysiology that can present with life-threatening electrolyte abnormalities.
809,89,"CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of a 57-year-old Caucasian woman with previous episodes of hypokalemia, severe muscle weakness, and fatigue."
810,89,"Upon further questioning, symptoms of dry eye and dry mouth became evident."
811,89,"Initial evaluation revealed hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, severe hypokalemia, persistent alkaline urine, and a positive urinary anion gap, suggestive of distal renal tubular acidosis."
812,89,Additional laboratory workup and renal biopsy led to the diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome with associated acute tubulointerstitial nephritis.
813,89,"After potassium and bicarbonate supplementation, immunomodulatory therapy with hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, and prednisone was started."
814,89,"Nonetheless, her renal function failed to improve and remained steady with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 42ml/min/1.73 m(2)."
815,89,The literature on this topic was reviewed.
816,89,"CONCLUSIONS: Cases of renal tubular acidosis should be carefully evaluated to prevent adverse complications, uncover a potentially treatable condition, and prevent the progression to chronic kidney disease."
817,89,Repeated episodes of unexplained hypokalemia could be an important clue for diagnosis.
818,90,Sjgren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects many individuals within the community.
819,90,"Despite this, its exact aetiology and pathogenesis is still unclear."
820,90,Sjgren's syndrome affects many organ systems in the body.
821,90,"However, for dental practitioners it is important to recognize the many oral and dental manifestations that are associated with the syndrome."
822,90,"In addition to these oral manifestations, this review will discuss the systemic manifestations of Sjgren's syndrome as well as the current understanding of factors that have a role in its aetiology and pathogenesis."
823,90,"Furthermore, this review will highlight the difficulties and complexities that are inherent in the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome and the important role that dental practitioners can play in the management of its oral manifestations."
824,90,The effective management of oral manifestations and minimization of oral disease in patients with Sjgren's syndrome can result in improved quality of life for these patients.
825,91,Objective: Systemic features influence disease prognosis and choice of treatment in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
826,91,"Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of pulmonary involvement in pSS patients and to classify patients according to the pulmonary domain of the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI).Methods: This retrospective cohort study included consecutive pSS patients, fulfilling American-European Consensus Group/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria, who visited the Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Medical Center Groningen, in 2015."
827,91,Data on pulmonary complaints and pulmonary tests were obtained from electronic patient records.
828,91,"Pulmonary involvement was recorded if therapy was needed or follow-up was recommended, and when it was possibly or assumed to be related to pSS instead of coincidental factors.Results: Of the 262 included pSS patients, 88 (34%) had pulmonary complaints, mostly cough or dyspnoea on exertion."
829,91,Pulmonary diagnostics were performed in 225 patients (86%).
830,91,Pulmonary involvement was present and assumed to be related to pSS in 25 patients (10%) and possibly related to pSS in 14 (5%).
831,91,"Interstitial lung disease (ILD, n =15), especially non-specific interstitial pneumonia (n=7), was present most commonly."
832,91,"In total, 16 patients (6%) were scored as low (n=4), moderate (n=11), or high activity (n=1) on the ESSDAI pulmonary domain.Conclusion: In this cross-sectional study in daily clinical practice, pulmonary involvement was present in 10-15% of pSS patients, of which ILD was most common."
833,91,"Of all pSS patients, 6% were scored as active on the pulmonary domain of the ESSDAI."
834,92,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and burning mouth syndrome (BMS) typically occur in postmenopausal women.
835,92,"Although these conditions have significantly different etiopathogeneses, patients with SS or BMS often present with analogous oral complaints."
836,92,"The similarities between the two conditions have led to considerable confusion on the part of medical and dental practitioners, and those with BMS or SS often wait years to receive a diagnosis."
837,92,"Therefore, it is imperative for clinicians to understand the characteristic subjective and objective features of each disease and how these can be used to distinguish them."
838,92,"This review will discuss the proposed etiology, clinical manifestations, histopathology, diagnostic criteria, and patient management of SS and BMS."
839,92,We also identify key differences between the two pathoses that aid in establishing the correct diagnosis.
840,92,Recognition of the defining features of each condition will lead to reduced time to diagnosis and improved patient management for these poorly understood conditions.
841,93,B-cells play a pivotal role in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) pathogenesis.
842,93,"We aim to (1) evaluate the distribution of B-lymphocyte subpopulations in pSS and Sicca patients, (2) establish cut-off points that discriminate pSS from controls, (3) evaluate the association between memory B-cells and phenotypic features in pSS."
843,93,"We included 57 pSS patients, 68 Sicca and 24 healthy controls."
844,93,Circulating B-cells were characterized by flow cytometry as nave and memory subsets and classified from Bm1 to Bm5.
845,93,"Compared to controls, pSS patients had lower percentages (29.5 vs 44.4%) and absolute numbers (47 vs 106 cells/l) of memory B-cells."
846,93,"Through ROC curves, a cut-off of 58 total memory B-cells/l yielded a specificity of 0.88 and a sensitivity of 0.60 for pSS, and was met by 59.6% of pSS patients, 38.8% of Sicca and 12.5% of controls."
847,93,"A cut-off of <23.5 Switched-memory B-cells/l yielded a specificity of 0.88 and a sensitivity of 0.54 and was met by 54.4% of pSS patients, 37.3% of Sicca and 12.5% of controls."
848,93,"In pSS, lower total memory B-cells count was associated with longer disease duration (14.3 vs 8.1 years, p=0.006) and more active disease profile, as evaluated by theEuropean League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) (3.1 vs 1.4, p=0.043)."
849,93,Decreased numbers of memory B-cells clearly discriminated pSS from controls and can also have prognostic value.
850,93,It remains to be clarified whether Sicca patients with decreased memory B-cells represent pSS and if B-cell profiling could help in the diagnosis of pSS.
851,94,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a debilitating systemic disease that may have oral complications.
852,94,Patients may be prone to dental caries and often have difficulty speaking and swallowing.
853,94,"Therefore, it is important for dental professionals to be familiar with the diagnosis and management of SS."
854,94,This review outlines the new SS diagnostic criteria and provides an overview of recent findings related to disease etiology.
855,94,"In addition, management of SS patients with xerostomia is discussed."
856,95,Background The contribution of tear protein expression in patients with presumed diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome is underestimated.
857,95,We aimed to evaluate the role of tear proteins in the Sjgren syndrome early diagnosis.
858,95,Methods Charts from 110 patients suspected of Sjgren syndrome were analysed and the subsequent diagnosis retrieved.
859,95,"Subjective symptoms (ocular surface disease index, OSDI), tear film break-up time (TFBUT), Schirmer test, Jones test, tear clearance (TC), corneal (NEI score) and conjunctival staining (van Bjerstelveldt score), esthesiometry, cytology, tear protein analysis (total protein [TP] content, lysozyme-C [LYS-C], lactoferrin [LACTO], lipocalin-1 [LIPOC-1] and albumin [ALB]) were analysed."
860,95,The diagnostic performance with area under the curve (AUC) and odds ratio (OR) for each parameter were calculated.
861,95,Results Thirty-five patients (31.8%) had been diagnosed as affected by Sjgren syndrome.
862,95,"Clinical tests showed lower diagnostic performance (OSDI>44 [AUC 0.57], Schirmer  5 mm [0.59], TFBUT  3 s [0.72], TC>1/16 [0.68], Jones  4 mm [0.68], corneal staining>2 [0.51], conjunctival staining>2 [0.78]) compared with tear proteins (LYS-C  1.5 mg/mL [0.79], LACTO  20% [0.94], LIPOC-1  10% [0.89], ALB  15% [0.79])."
863,95,"LYS-C, LACTO, LIPOC-1 and ALB showed a significant association in predicting Sjgren syndrome vs. not-Sjgren syndrome dry eye (OR, respectively, 4.9, 5.5, 7.2, 6.7)."
864,95,Conclusions Tear proteins' concentrations showed a significant higher accuracy compared with the traditional ocular clinical tests for reaching Sjgren syndrome's diagnosis.
865,95,"In particular, LACTO and LIPOC-1 provided an excellent diagnostic performance and thus could likely be considered promising biomarkers of Sjgren syndrome."
866,96,"OBJECTIVE: To compare quality of life (QoL), depression, anxiety, and fatigue in prospectively included patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) or with sicca but no diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome."
867,96,"METHODS: Patients undergoing a multidisciplinary evaluation at a single university center in Brest, France, for suspected pSS and having sicca symptoms were included prospectively between November 2006 and December 2013."
868,96,The same standardized investigations were performed in all patients.
869,96,pSS and sicca not due to pSS diagnoses were based on evaluating physician opinion.
870,96,"Each patient completed three validated questionnaires on QoL (SF-36), fatigue (MFI), depression and anxiety (HADS)."
871,96,"RESULTS: Of the 95 included patients, 55 (57.9%) had pSS and 40 (42.1%) had sicca without pSS."
872,96,"Gender distribution, age, disease duration, and sicca symptoms were similar in the two groups."
873,96,The pSS group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with abnormal objective tests for dryness (Schirmer's test and salivary flow rate).
874,96,"The SF-36, HADS, and MFI scores were similarly altered in the two groups."
875,96,Anxiety was more common than depression in both groups.
876,96,The most affected domains were vitality in the SF-36 and general/physical fatigue in the MFI.
877,96,Extraglandular systemic involvement was not a major determinant of QoL alteration in patients with pSS.
878,96,"CONCLUSIONS: Sicca symptoms are associated with severe alterations in SF-36, HADS, and MFI scores regardless of objective test abnormalities and pSS diagnosis."
879,96,Anxiety is more common than depression and should be taken into account when managing all patients with sicca symptoms.
880,97,OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) as a single test for the detection of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and examine the prognostic factors for severe structural damage of the salivary glands based on SGUS score.
881,97,"METHODS: Patients with pSS (n=94) and idiopathic sicca syndrome (n=44) were evaluated using the SGUS 0-48 scoring system, which comprises five parameters: parenchymal echogenicity, homogeneity, hypoechoic areas, hyperechogenic reflections, and clearness of posterior borders."
882,97,The salivary gland volume and intraglandular power Doppler signal (PDS) were also assessed.
883,97,A multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with SGUS score.
884,97,"RESULTS: Patients with pSS showed a significantly higher SGUS score than controls [median (IQR): 24.5 (13.0) vs 6 (3.75), p<0.001]."
885,97,An SGUS cut-off of 14 had a sensitivity of 80.9% and a specificity of 95.5% for the diagnosis of pSS.
886,97,There were no significant differences in the measured volumes and PDS between pSS patients and controls.
887,97,"The SGUS score correlated with unstimulated salivary flow rate (USFR), serum rheumatoid factor and IgG."
888,97,"Double seropositivity with anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B (=6.060, p=0.001) and USFR (=-1.913, p<0.001) were independently associated with the SGUS score."
889,97,CONCLUSIONS: The SGUS scoring system is a valuable diagnostic method for pSS.
890,97,Double seropositivity of anti-Ro/SS-A and La/SS-B along with USFR were independent predictive factors for structural damage of the salivary glands.
891,98,BACKGROUND: The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) had been reported to be rare.
892,98,"However, recent studies using echocardiography as a screening method showed conflicting results, and the true prevalence is still unclear."
893,98,"Since diagnosing primary SS is difficult because of its heterogeneous nature, a number of patients with primary-SS-associated PAH may be misdiagnosed with idiopathic PAH, losing their chance to undergo immunosuppressive therapy."
894,98,"Therefore, we sought to elucidate the prevalence of primary SS among patients who initially present with PAH."
895,98,"METHODS: From our prospective institutional PAH database, 40 consecutive patients without any obvious cause of PAH at the time of PAH diagnosis were identified."
896,98,We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of primary SS diagnosed during or after the initial assessment of PAH.
897,98,"RESULTS: During the initial assessment, one patient was diagnosed with primary-SS-associated PAH."
898,98,"Among the 25 patients who were initially diagnosed with idiopathic PAH, five were diagnosed with primary SS during their course of the disease."
899,98,"Of the five patients, three had key signs suggesting primary SS and were probably underdiagnosed at the time of initial evaluation."
900,98,"The remaining two patients, who were finally diagnosed with primary SS, did not have any specific signs suggesting primary SS at the time of initial evaluation but showed positive conversion of their autoantibodies during the course of PAH."
901,98,CONCLUSION: The prevalence of primary-SS-associated PAH may be relatively high among patients who undergo initial evaluation for PAH.
902,98,"Furthermore, primary-SS-associated PAH may be underdiagnosed with routine evaluation for the primary cause of PAH."
903,98,Clinicians should pay specific attention and carefully evaluate the possibility of primary SS in patients with PAH.
904,99,Mucosal dryness is a key clinical feature in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and its assessment relies on both objective measurement of residual secretion and subjective symptoms reported by patients.
905,99,"However, while the objective assessment and grading of glandular dysfunction can be easily performed, the spectrum of clinical symptoms encompassed by the terms 'dry eye' and 'dry mouth' is wide and heterogeneous."
906,99,"Therefore, patient reported outcomes (PROs) for dryness in pSS poorly correlate with the amount of glandular secretion."
907,99,"In addition, subjective dryness is not correlated with the severity of systemic disease and severely affects the patient quality of life even in presence of active extraglandular manifestations."
908,99,"The purpose of this review article is to provide an overview of glandular dysfunction in pSS as well as the impact of discrepancy between objective assessment, subjective symptom and extraglandular disease activity on disease management."
909,100,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate ultrasonographically the salivary glands and to correlate ultrasonographic parameters with focus score, serum beta-2-microglobulin, and stimulated salivary flow rate."
910,100,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: 32 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and 32 healthy controls were enrolled in this case-control study, performed in the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, ""Victor Babe"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timioara, Romania."
911,100,"All the patients and controls were examined by salivary gland ultrasonography (B-mode, color and spectral Doppler, and sonoelastography), determining the following parameters: salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) score, resistive index (RI) of transverse facial artery, and shear wave velocity (SWV)."
912,100,Serum beta-2-microglobulin and stimulated saliva amount were determined in all the patients and controls.
913,100,Minor salivary gland biopsy with focus score assessment was done in pSS patients.
914,100,RESULTS: Patients with pSS presented higher SGUS score and parotid and submandibular SWV and reduced RI of transverse facial artery than controls (p < 0.0001).
915,100,"In pSS patients, statistically significant correlations were identified between assessed ultrasonographic parameters and focus score, serum beta-2-microglobulin, and respective stimulated saliva flow (p < 0.0001)."
916,100,"CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted statistically significant correlations between salivary gland ultrasonographic parameters and focus score, serum beta-2-microglobulin, and stimulated saliva flow."
917,101,OBJECTIVE: To use the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test to assess the subclinical cognitive impairment in patients with Primary Sjogren`s Syndrome (PSS) and assess the correlation of MoCA results with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in these patients.
918,101,"METHODS: The MoCA test was prospectively administered to 32 consecutive patients (31 females, 1 male) diagnosed with PSS and 30 healthy controls (29 females, 1 male) at Antalya Education and Research Hospital between June 2014 and October 2015."
919,101,"Twenty PSS patients underwent a brain MRI (T1, T2, and T2- FLAIR-weighted sequences)."
920,101,"RESULTS: The mean age was 45.84 (range 24-63) in the PSS group, and the mean duration of disease was 3.5 years (4 months - 18 years)."
921,101,There were 22 patients (68.80%) with 5-8 years of education and 10 patients (31.30%) with more than 8 years of education.
922,101,The mean age was 42.8 (28-64) in the control group.
923,101,There were 20 controls (66.70%) with 5-8 years of education and 10 controls (33.3%) with more than 8 years of education.
924,101,"The delayed recall rate of the patient group with 5-8 years of education was significantly lower than that of the control group, and the recall rate with multiple choice cues for the same patient group was significantly higher than that of the control group (p less than 0.05)."
925,101,There was no correlation between the number of lesions and total MoCA score or subgroups.
926,101,"CONCLUSION: We suggest that the MoCA test is a single-page, easy-to-administer test, can be used to assess cognition in patients with PSS especially in large groups."
927,102,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome is a complex, autoimmune disease with distinct clinical phenotypes and variable outcomes."
928,102,The systemic form of the disease is characterized by immune complex-mediated manifestations and is complicated by lymphoma as a result of a polyclonal B cell hyperactivity that is evolving into B cell malignancy.
929,102,"In the past decades, well-established clinical and serological markers have been described in the literature to identify high-risk patients and predict lymphoma development."
930,102,"However, specific biological treatments have proven ineffective to control the disease."
931,102,"Significant research effort has been made to reveal the major underlying biological events in this subgroup and identify biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis and response to treatment."
932,102,"In this review, we summarize the current data for the proposed histological, molecular and genetic biomarkers."
933,103,RATIONALE: It is known that 5% to 34% of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) cases are complicated by neuropathy in the form of myelitis.
934,103,"Although SS myelopathy (SSM) is often treated with glucocorticoid (GC) and immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide (CY), a therapeutic strategy for SSM has not been established."
935,103,PATIENT CONCERNS: A 65-year-old female was admitted with weakness and thermal hypoalgesia in the lower limbs.
936,103,"Four months before this admission, she showed weakness in her lower limbs and thermal hypoalgesia of bilateral upper and lower limbs."
937,103,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the cause of her neurological symptoms was cervical myelitis.
938,103,She was diagnosed with SS because she tested positive for the ophthalmic test (Schirmer's test and fluorescent test) and for the anti-SS-A antibodies.
939,103,"Therefore, myelitis was thought to be a complication of SS."
940,103,She was treated with GC and CY.
941,103,"Both neurological symptoms and MRI findings temporarily improved, and the GC dose was gradually decreased."
942,103,"One month before this admission, her neurological symptoms and MRI findings were exacerbated."
943,103,"Upon relapse of SSM, serum amyloid A protein (SAA) level was markedly elevated."
944,103,"DIAGNOSES: Based on MRI findings, the diagnosis was SSM relapse."
945,103,INTERVENTIONS: Treatment by subcutaneous tocilizumab (TCZ) 162mg every two weeks was introduced.
946,103,"OUTCOMES: After introducing TCZ, her neurological symptoms and MRI findings gradually improved."
947,103,SAA levels remained low.
948,103,"At eight months after the introduction of TCZ, the GC dose has been decreased and so far, the myelitis has not relapsed."
949,103,LESSONS: This case report is the first report suggesting the effectiveness of TCZ for refractory SSM.
950,103,Subcutaneous TCZ might be an effective therapeutic option for treating refractory SSM when SAA levels are elevated.
951,104,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disease which might progress to mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (pSS/MALT).
952,104,Diagnosis of pSS requires an invasive tissue biopsy and a delay in diagnosis of pSS has been frequently reported.
953,104,"In this study, four proteins including cofilin-1, alpha-enolase, annexin A2 and Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2 (RGI2) were found to be over-expressed in pSS and pSS/MALT by 2D gel electrophoresis/mass spectrometry, and the finding was verified by the microarray analysis and western blotting results."
954,104,"We then developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for autoantibodies including anti-cofilin-1, anti-alpha-enolase and anti-RGI2 with good quantitative ability."
955,104,"The expression levels of salivary anti-cofilin-1, anti-alpha-enolase and anti-RGI2 were found to be the highest in pSS/MALT patients and lowest in healthy controls."
956,104,"The combination of these three antiantibodies yielded an ""area under the curve"" (AUC) value of 0.94 with an 86% sensitivity and 93% specificity in distinguishing patients with pSS from healthy controls, an AUC value of 0.99 with a 95% sensitivity and 94% specificity in distinguishing patients with pSS/MALT from healthy controls and an AUC value of 0.86 with a 75% sensitivity and 94% specificity in distinguishing pSS/MALT patients from pSS patients."
957,104,"Collectively, we have successfully identified a panel of potential autoantigens that are progressively up-regulated during the development of pSS and its progression to MALT lymphoma."
958,104,The autoantibody biomarkers may be used to help diagnose pSS and predict its progression to MALT lymphoma.
959,105,"RATIONALE: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare, fatal disorder which could be caused by autoimmune diseases."
960,105,"However, TTP secondary to Sjgren syndrome (SS) is extremely rare."
961,105,PATIENT CONCERNS: A 47-year- old woman with an 8-year history of SS was admitted due to skin ecchymosis and bleeding gums.
962,105,Then she gradually developed fever and headache.
963,105,"DIAGNOSES: Laboratory investigations suggested anemia, thrombocytopenia, increased lactic dehydrogenase, and a disintegrin-like metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif type 1 member 13 (ADAMTS13) activity deficiency with high inhibitor titers."
964,105,Acquired TTP was thus diagnosed.
965,105,"INTERVENTIONS: Plasma exchange (PE) was the first choice for treatment, while glucocorticoid, cyclosporine A (CSA), rituximab, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) were used simultaneously."
966,105,"Bortezomib, a selective proteasome inhibitor and thereby inducing apoptosis in both B-cells and plasma cells, was added."
967,105,OUTCOMES: She was discharged from the hospital and then treated with prednisone of 40mg/d and hydroxychloroquine.
968,105,The patient remained in full remission.
969,105,"LESSONS: We conclude that bortezomib should be considered for patients with TTP refractory to PE, steroids, and rituximab due to its efficacy and relatively favorable side effect profile."
970,106,We report the case of a 53-year-old woman with Sjgren syndrome and cryoglobulinemia.
971,106,"The patient presented with nephrotic syndrome, hematuria, and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate."
972,106,"The kidney biopsy revealed diffuse endocapillary proliferation and leukocyte exudation with focal intraluminal hyaline thrombi, prominent tubulointerstitial inflammation, and vasculitis."
973,106,"Diffuse granular mesangial and segmental to global capillary wall staining was observed on immunofluorescence with antisera to C3 and immunoglobulin M (IgM), with less intense staining indicative of IgG and  and  light chains."
974,106,A biopsy diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome-related cryoglobulinemic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and vasculitis was rendered.
975,106,Subsequent investigations revealed the presence of circulating type II cryoglobulins with cryocrit of 9%.
976,106,"Although rare, Sjgren syndrome is the most common cause of non-hepatitis C virus-related mixed cryoglobulinemia."
977,106,"We discuss the possible pathogenic mechanisms involved in the development of mixed cryoglobulinemia and its evolution to lymphoma, as best described in the setting of hepatitis C virus infection."
978,106,"Although the specific antigen involved is unknown, it is likely that the mixed cryoglobulinemia in Sjgren syndrome is triggered by the long-term B-cell stimulation, resulting in clonal proliferation of B cells."
979,106,"Additional chromosomal aberrations and cytokine milieu alterations, as seen in hepatitis C virus infection, may result in prolonged B-cell survival and progression to non-Hodgkin lymphoma."
980,107,PURPOSE: The goal of this study is to determine whether any difference in corneal biomechanical properties exists between Sjgren's syndrome dry eye patients and healthy subjects.
981,107,METHODS: Thirty-one patients diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome and associated dry eye manifestations and 44 healthy individuals were included in the study.
982,107,Ultrasonic pachymetry (UP) was used to measure central corneal thickness (CCT).
983,107,Corneal biomechanical parameters were obtained using ocular response analyzer (ORA).
984,107,"The main parameters assessed were corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), Goldmann correlated intraocular pressure (IOPg) and corneal compensated IOP (IOPcc)."
985,107,A Student's t-test for independent groups was performed to compare the mean of these variables between both groups.
986,107,"RESULTS: Mean CH values in Sjgren's syndrome and healthy subject eyes were 10.1mmHg and 11.18mmHg respectively, representing a statistically significant difference (P=0.003)."
987,107,No other variable measured differed between cases and controls (P>0.05).
988,107,"Mean CRF values were 9.51mmHg and 10.37mmHg respectively, and mean CCT measured by UP in cases and controls was 527.41m and 552.51m respectively."
989,107,"CONCLUSIONS: Sjgren's syndrome can influence corneal biomechanical properties, specifically CH."
990,107,ORA measurements should be considered of interest in the evaluation of Sjgren syndrome subjects.
991,108,"PURPOSE: It will provide a reference for early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment of atypical primary Sjogren syndrome with neurological impairment as the first symptom."
992,108,METHODS: Case report and Literature review.
993,108,"RESULTS: Here we report a 30-year-old woman diagnosed with trigeminal damage secondary to pSS who presented atypical trigeminal neuralgia of numbness of the right head and face and persistent prickling-like pain not associated with eating, talking or tooth-brushing, and had no ""trigger point""."
994,108,"The patient further received rheumatoid immune factor tests, ophthalmic examinations, salivary gland emissioncomputed tomography(ECT) and lip biopsy, and found positive antinuclear antibodies (1:320), atypical xerophthalmia, impaired intake and excretion of bilateral salivary glands and degree II of lip biopsy."
995,108,"The patient received methylprednisolone and antiviral therapy, which showed very good outcome."
996,108,"CONCLUSIONS: Clinically primary Sjgren Syndrome (pSS) combined with trigeminal lesion is common, but cases of pSS with trigeminal involvement as initial symptom have rarely been reported, which is easy to misdiagnose."
997,108,"This case suggested that the signs of simple trigeminal lesion, especially those with atypical manifestations, could be the early manifestation of other systemic diseases."
998,108,"Attention should be paid to identification of the pathogeny of the primary disease to achieve early identification, diagnosis and treatment."
999,109,Accelerated atherosclerosis is a distinct feature of some inflammatory and autoimmune disorders and several specific autoimmune mechanisms and persistent inflammation have been identified to exert a pivotal role in precocious atherosclerotic damage in these disorders.
1000,109,"Although increased atherosclerotic risk has been well established in some rheumatic autoimmune systemic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, reliable data regarding the prevalence and pathogenetic mechanisms associated with increased atherosclerotic damage in primary Sjgren's syndrome are scarse."
1001,109,"Indeed, primary Sjgren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterised by chronic inflammation and autoimmune dysregulation that shares many pathogenic mechanisms and clinical features with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthitis."
1002,109,Higher prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis has been observed in primary Sjgren's syndrome patients and recent population-based studies demonstrated an increased risk of cardiovascular events in these patients in comparison to general population.
1003,109,"Among mechanisms associated with atherosclerotic damage, the prevalence and the role of traditional cardiovascular risk factors have been poorly investigated."
1004,109,"In particular, the issue of whether the presence of these cardiovascular risk factors is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events needs to be further explored."
1005,110,Sjgren's syndrome is a frequent autoimmune disease and is associated with a lymphocytic infiltration of the lachrymal and salivary glands and with sicca symptoms.
1006,110,"Its diagnostic procedures consist of the quantification of tear and saliva production, identification of extraglandular manifestations, measurement of antibodies against SS-A and SS-B and of salivary gland biopsies."
1007,110,"Dry eyes and dry mouth are treated only symptomatically, whereas extraglandular manifestations are treated similar to systemic lupus erythematosus."
1008,111,"AIM: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) represents a challenging illness to diagnose properly and, because of the serious complications such as lymphoma, it is important to reach a correct diagnosis in early stages."
1009,111,Aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the correlation between histopathologic result of minor salivary gland biopsy and clinical and serologic parameters for the diagnosis of SS.
1010,111,"METHODS: We evaluated 360 biopsies, taken from the lower lip, of 360 patients (18 males) on suspicion that they were suffering from SS."
1011,111,The Chisolm and Mason classification was used to state the diagnosis of SS.
1012,111,"For each patient, the medical history and the symptoms were evaluated, and diagnostic tests were performed."
1013,111,The revised rules of the American-European Consensus Group Criteria were used to diagnose primary and secondary SS.
1014,111,For the statistical analysis we used the Chi(2) test; a difference of P<0.05 was considered significant.
1015,111,"RESULTS: Considering the statistical correlation between a focal score > or =1 and the serological data, it was noted that a positive score was significantly correlated to all serological parameters examined (P<0.0001)."
1016,111,A significant correlation was also found between a positive biopsy score and Schirmer's test and Rose Bengal test (P<0.0001).
1017,111,"However, with regard to the clinical data, a significant correlation was found only for two parameters: xerostomia (P<0.0001) and parotid swelling (P<0.05)."
1018,111,CONCLUSION: Minor salivary gland biopsies are of great diagnostic value in detecting SS.
1019,111,"However, for the diagnosis of SS both clinical and serologic parameters should be considered."
1020,111,The data obtained from the present survey reveal that the serologic markers are more predictive than clinical parameters for a positive biopsy score.
1021,112,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of exocrine glands.
1022,112,SS particularly affects the lacrimal and salivary glands.
1023,112,"Dry mouth and dry eyes are frequently proffered as presenting symptoms, but nonspecific symptoms such as malaise and fatigue, and extraglandular manifestations like purpura, polyneuropathy and arthritis are also often present."
1024,112,"Moreover, lymphomas develop in about 7.5% of SS patients, mostly marginal zone B-cell lymhomas."
1025,112,"Futhermore, SS has a very substantial impact on the patients' quality of life and their daily activities."
1026,112,"Recently, many breakthroughs have been seen in salivary diagnostics, which not only can be used for diagnosis but also for monitoring of disease activity and disease progression as well as for objectively scoring the effect of intervention treatment with biologicals."
1027,112,"In addition, salivary proteomics, genomics and system biology have been shown to be very promising tools in unravelling the pathophysiology of SS, thus providing in depth insight in its underlying mechanisms which could give clues for intervention therapies with biologicals."
1028,112,The latter is of particular interest as B cell depletion therapy has been shown a very promising therapy for a subgroup of SS patients.
1029,112,"When applying salivary diagnostics in combination with instruments to rate disease activity and progression in SS, one might be able to select those SS patients who respond to a particular type of biological."
1030,112,These topics are addressed in this review and promises for the near future are described.
1031,113,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) can be associated with inflammatory arthritis, which is underdiagnosed by clinical examination."
1032,113,"The aim of this cross-sectional, observational study was to compare, for the first time, the ultrasound (US)-detected joint abnormalities in these two diseases and to define the role of US in patient management."
1033,113,"Participants had SLE (n=18) and SS (n=23), symptoms of hand joint pain and no previous diagnosis of arthritis."
1034,113,"Data on disease activity, duration, damage scores, inflammatory and serologic markers, treatment and clinical and ultrasound parameters (derived from the assessment of 902 joints) were analysed and correlated using descriptive statistics, correlation tests and regression models."
1035,113,Subclinical synovitis/tenosynovitis was detected in 44.4% of SLE patients and 21.7% of SS patients (p=0.23).
1036,113,There was no significant correlation between either the total Power Doppler score or the total grey-scale score and disease activity scores (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group index and European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index).
1037,113,Both damage scores (Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics index and Sjgren's syndrome disease damage index) correlated with the total grey-scale synovitis score.
1038,113,"Significant proportions of the participants with SLE and SS had erosions (55.6% and 34.8%, respectively, p=0.184) and osteophytes (61.1% vs. 60.9%, p=0.98) in at least one joint."
1039,113,The lack of correlation between disease activity scores and US outcome measures indicated their limitations in diagnosing subclinical synovitis in SLE and SS patients.
1040,113,Future research is needed to determine if the development of erosions could be prevented by early diagnosis and prompt treatment of inflammatory arthritis associated with SLE and SS.
1041,114,"Sjgren's syndrome is an autoimmune exocrinopathy characterized by keratoconjunctivis sicca, xerostomia and immune-inflammatory systemic manifestations."
1042,114,"The diagnosis is easy to establish when the patient presents with sicca complex as a main symptom, or recurring attacks of parotitis."
1043,114,"However, it is way more complex when the disease begins with extraglandular features, such as non erosive polyarticular arthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon, peripheral or central nervous system involvement, kidney disease or interstitial pneumonary disease, or even vasculitis."
1044,114,"In such circumstances, diagnosis is often delayed several years."
1045,115,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the secretory function of parotid glands by dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) sialography and determine the clinical performance of this technique in diagnosing and evaluating Sjgren's syndrome (SS) patients.
1046,115,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study enrolled 29 healthy volunteers (25 women and 4 men; mean age, 34.8  6.3 years; age range, 26-47 years) and 25 primary SS (pSS) patients (23 women and 2 men; mean age, 37.7  7.9 years; age range, 25-50 years) with decreased secretory function."
1047,115,The volume of the parotid gland ducts was precisely measured for both groups at single pre- and 6 post-gustatory-stimulated phases.
1048,115,"Time-dependent volume change ratio curves were generated, four parameters were derived from the curves: the slope of the increase in the first post-stimulation phase (slope(1st)), the peak value, the time-to-peak, the total saliva secretion post-stimulation."
1049,115,All values were used to quantitatively evaluate the secretory function of the parotid gland.
1050,115,"The repeated measurement analysis, Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic curve were applied."
1051,115,RESULTS: Time-dependent volume change ratio curves demonstrated that there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups (F = 8.750; p = 0.005).
1052,115,"A quickly increasing curve was shown in the volunteer group, whereas a slowly increasing curve was shown in the pSS patient group."
1053,115,"The slope1st, peak value and total saliva secretion post-stimulation of the patient group were significantly lower than those of the volunteer group (p = 0.005, p = 0.003, and p = 0.002, respectively)."
1054,115,The time-to-peak between the two groups was not significantly different (p = 0.383).
1055,115,The slope1st can be used as a discriminator to diagnose SS patients (p = 0.015; odds ratio = 4.234; area under the curve = 0.726).
1056,115,CONCLUSION: Dynamic MR sialography is proven to be an effective method in evaluating salivary gland function and has a great potential in diagnosing and evaluating pSS patients.
1057,116,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the performance of the new 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)-European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) with 1999 revised Japanese Ministry of Health criteria for diagnosis of SS (JPN), 2002 American-European Consensus Group classification criteria for SS (AECG) and 2012 ACR classification criteria for SS (ACR) in Japanese patients."
1058,116,METHODS: The study subjects were 499 patients with primary SS (pSS) or suspected pSS who were followed up in June 2012 at 10 hospitals in Japan.
1059,116,"All patients had been assessed for all four criteria of JPN (pathology, oral, ocular, anti-SS-A/SS-B antibodies)."
1060,116,The clinical diagnosis by the physician in charge was set as the 'gold standard'.
1061,116,RESULTS: pSS was diagnosed in 302 patients and ruled out in 197 patients by the physician in charge.
1062,116,"The sensitivity of the ACR-EULAR criteria in the diagnosis of pSS (95.4%) was higher than those of the JPN, AECG and ACR (82.1%, 89.4% and 79.1%, respectively), while the specificity of the ACR-EULAR (72.1%) was lower than those of the three sets (90.9%, 84.3% and 84.8%, respectively)."
1063,116,The differences of sensitivities and specificities between the ACR-EULAR and other three sets of criteria were statistically significant (p<0.001).
1064,116,"Eight out of 302 patients with pSS and 11 cases out of 197 non-pSS cases satisfied only the ACR-EULAR criteria, compared with none of the other three sets."
1065,116,"CONCLUSIONS: The ACR-EULAR criteria had significantly higher sensitivity and lower specificity in diagnosis of pSS, compared with the currently available three sets of criteria."
1066,117,We present a 44-year-old female with an initial presentation with distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) after she presented with hypokalaemia and normal anion gap acidosis.
1067,117,"Three years following the diagnosis, she presented with progressive renal impairment."
1068,117,"In the absence of any clinical, biochemical and radiological clues, she underwent a renal biopsy which showed severe tubulitis secondary to lymphocytic infiltration."
1069,117,"Serological investigations subsequently revealed positive anti-nuclear, anti-Sjgren's syndrome related antigen A (SS-A), and anti-Sjgren's syndrome related antigen B (SS-B) antibodies, supporting the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome."
1070,117,This case is unique in that distal RTA was the presenting clinical manifestation of Sjgren's syndrome.
1071,117,We hope that a consideration for Sjgren's syndrome is made in patients with seemingly idiopathic RTA.
1072,118,AIM: To assess the clinical and laboratory features of primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) in a large teaching hospital in China.
1073,118,METHODS: Three hundred and fifteen pSS patients diagnosed according to American-European Classification Criteria and consecutively admitted to Anhui Provincial Hospital from 1 January 1999 to 30 September 2012 were retrospectively selected in this study.
1074,118,RESULTS: The median age was 46.8  14.4 years (range 13-83 years) and the majority of patients were female (96.5%).
1075,118,"The common clinical features at initial presentations were dry mouth (50.2%), dry eyes (31.4%) and joint pain (24.8%); 92.6% of patients had positive anti-SSA antibody and 49.2% patients had positive anti-SSB antibody."
1076,118,One hundred and eighteen patients underwent labial salivary gland biopsy.
1077,118,"According to Chisholm grading criteria, grade 3 to 4 was present in 58.5% of the patients."
1078,118,The frequency of interstitial lung disease (ILD) occurred (20.9%) in the patients with systemic extraglandular manifestations.
1079,118,The patients with ILD were frequently associated with positive anti-SSA (P = 0.005) and low levels of C3.
1080,118,The most common impairment of lung function was small airway function abnormalities.
1081,118,"Sixty-six pSS patients with ILD (pSS-ILD) were diagnosed with high-resolution computed tomography and treated with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants, in which 18 patients had improved pulmonary function."
1082,118,CONCLUSION: Labial salivary gland biopsy and anti-nuclear antibodies spectrum were important to the diagnosis of pSS.
1083,118,"The pSS patients had high percentage of ILD, especially small airway function abnormalities."
1084,118,The combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants appears to be effective in treatment of pSS patients with ILD.
1085,119,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease causing destruction of the exocrine glands secondary to lymphocytic infiltration.
1086,119,"Common clinical symptoms of SS are xerostomia, xerophthalmia, myalgia, arthritis, and vasculitis."
1087,119,Neurological symptoms may precede the diagnosis of SS by up to 2 years in about 80% of patients.
1088,119,A 28-year-old female presented to us with complaints of horizontal and vertical diplopia along with inability to move the right eye and sudden drooping of the right upper eyelid.
1089,119,She was a recently diagnosed case of type 2 diabetes mellitus and had a history of foreign body sensation in both eyes for 4 months.
1090,119,"Schirmers I test revealed less than 5 mm of wetting in both eyes after 5 min, suggesting dry eyes."
1091,119,"On immunological blood investigations, serum c-peptide was normal, rheumatoid factor was negative, antinuclear antibodies were positive, and proliferating cell nuclear antigens were positive."
1092,119,Extractable Nuclear Ag profile RO 52 was strongly positive suggestive of primary SS.
1093,119,"Lip biopsy revealed mild-to-moderate chronic inflammation showing irregular acanthotic epidermis, and dermis had perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate."
1094,119,"Thus, the possible diagnosis of primary SS with type 2 diabetes mellitus and right-sided total external ophthalmoplegia was made."
1095,119,"Patient was prescribed subcutaneous insulin, multivitamins, tear substitutes and alternate patching."
1096,119,Later on insulin was replaced by oral hypoglycemics.
1097,119,The external ophthalmoplegia completely resolved within 6 weeks.
1098,119,"So, total external ophthalmoplegia can be added to the spectrum of central nervous system involvement in SS."
1099,120,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a rare condition characterized by structural damage and secretory dysfunction of the lacrimal and salivary glands that leads to dryness, particularly xerophthalmia (eyes) and xerostomia (mouth)."
1100,120,"No cure is known; however, the effects of the disease are manageable and symptoms may be reduced."
1101,120,"Although the salivary damage is irreversible, the dental decay and oral infections may be prevented, which highlights the importance that the clinician plays in the diagnosis and management of SS."
1102,120,"The cardinal features of this disease are summarized through the case report of primary SS in a 23-year-old woman who received an early diagnosis based on clinical features, laboratory investigations, lower lip biopsy, and imaging findings."
1103,121,"In recent years, salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) has emerged as a promising tool for the diagnosis and prognostic stratification of patients with primary and secondary Sjgren's syndrome."
1104,121,Several studies have emphasized that salivary ultrasonography could be a highly specific tool for the diagnosis of the disease.
1105,121,"However, before it can be used in daily clinical practice the SGUS procedure needs standardization and validation in larger disease-control groups."
1106,121,In this review we provide an update on the role of SGUS in the diagnostic algorithm of primary Sjgren's syndrome.
1107,122,AIM/INTRODUCTION: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a prototypical systemic autoimmune disease that manifests with various signs and symptoms.
1108,122,"Although some studies have examined these manifestations over the long-term course of the disease, the association between initial clinical and immunological factors and subsequent long-term manifestations has not been fully elucidated."
1109,122,The aim of this study is to identify initial clinical and immunological factors associated with subsequent manifestations in patients with pSS.
1110,122,METHOD: A retrospective review was performed in pSS patients who were followed up over a 10-year period in our department.
1111,122,"Clinical and immunological data, including serum immunoglobulin (Ig) and autoantibody levels, were collected and statistically analyzed."
1112,122,RESULT: We analyzed 91 patients who were followed up in our department.
1113,122,"The proportion of patients with extraglandular involvement decreased from 90% to 73%, while eight patients developed extraglandular organ involvement."
1114,122,Extraglandular involvement at 10years more frequently occurred in patients with hyper-IgG than those without hyper-IgG at initial testing (P<0.01).
1115,122,Extraglandular organ involvement at 10years more frequently occurred in rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive patients at the time of SS diagnosis (P<0.05).
1116,122,Malignancy occurred in 9% of patients.
1117,122,"Age, lower CH50 and thrombocytopenia were significantly associated with malignancy."
1118,122,Extraglandular organ involvement was associated with the presence of hyper-IgG and RF positivity (P<0.01 and P<0.05).
1119,122,CONCLUSION: Our study identified important initial clinical and immunological factors associated with subsequent manifestations in patients with pSS over a long follow-up period.
1120,122,pSS patients with RF and hyper-IgG at diagnosis may have a higher risk of subsequent extraglandular involvement.
1121,123,BACKGROUND/AIMS: To determine the prevalence of autonomic dysfunction among Korean patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) and its associations with the clinical features of pSS.
1122,123,METHODS: We analyzed 154 participants from the Korean Initiative of primary Sjogren's Syndrome (KISS) as a prospective pSS cohort and 154 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.
1123,123,"A standardized 5-minute, supine, resting heart rate variability (HRV) test was performed, and autonomic dysfunction was defined as standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals (SDNN) < 30 ms in patients < 50 years old and SDNN < 20 ms in patients  50 years old."
1124,123,The associations between autonomic dysfunction and various clinical features of pSS were analyzed.
1125,123,RESULTS: The overall autonomic activity in patients with pSS was significantly lower than that in controls.
1126,123,Autonomic dysfunction with the HRV test was observed in 35.7% of the KISS participants and was associated with a higher European League Against Rheumatism Sjogren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index fatigue score (p = 0.024).
1127,123,"Raynaud's phenomenon was a more frequent clinical presentation in pSS patients with autonomic dysfunction than in those without autonomic dysfunction (29.4% and 14.4%, respectively; p = 0.048)."
1128,123,Decreased parasympathetic activity was observed in 41.6% of pSS patients.
1129,123,No differences were found in the oral and ocular signs of pSS according to the decreased parasympathetic activity.
1130,123,"CONCLUSIONS: In Korean patients with pSS, decreased and imbalanced autonomic activity is prevalent and is associated with fatigue."
1131,123,"However, an association between autonomic dysfunction and glandular manifestations was not detected."
1132,124,"A total of 136 subjects (51 SS patients, 35 sicca syndrome patients without SS, and 50 healthy volunteers) were enrolled in this study."
1133,124,"The mean SWV value for salivary glands of SS patients was statistically higher than that of controls (2.81  0.66m/s versus 1.85  0.28m/s for parotid glands and 2.29  0.34m/s versus 1.82  0.25m/s for submandibular glands, resp.)."
1134,124,"Combining SWV values of parotid and submandibular glands gives a sensitivity of 88.2% (95% CI: 76.1-95.6%) and specificity of 96.0% (95% CI: 86.3-99.5%) at the cutoff point of 2.19m/s, with an AUROC of 0.954 (95% CI: 0.893-0.986)."
1135,124,"In addition, combining SGUS score and SWV value yields a sensitivity of 98.0% (95% CI: 89.6-100%), specificity of 90.0% (95% CI: 78.2-96.7%), and AUROC of 0.962 (95% CI: 0.904-0.990)."
1136,124,Classification tree considering the sequential use of SGUS score and SWV value achieved 92.1% accuracy for diagnosis of SS.
1137,124,"Similarly, the ROC curve of combined SGUS scores and SWV values yields an AUROC of 0.954 (95% CI: 0.885-0.987), sensitivity of 97.1% (95% CI: 85.1-99.9%), and specificity of 92.2% (95% CI: 81.1-97.8%) for separating sicca syndrome patients (without SS) from SS patients."
1138,124,Combining SGUS and VTQ provides a promising tool for diagnosis of SS.
1139,125,OBJECTIVE: To carry out the cross-cultural adaptation of Eular Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) for Portuguese language and evaluate its psychometric properties.
1140,125,METHOD: Cross-sectional study of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
1141,125,The psychometric properties (intraobserver reproducibility and construct validity) were studied.
1142,125,"In construct validity, ESSPRI was compared with the Patient's Global Assessment (PGA), Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort (Profad), Sicca Symptoms Inventory (SSI) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (Facit-F)."
1143,125,"Statistical tests used were:Cronbach's alpha, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Bland-Altman method and Spearman coefficient."
1144,125,A value of p  0.05 was considered significant.
1145,125,"RESULTS: There was no difference between versions in both languages; thus, a Brazilian consensual version was obtained."
1146,125,"All subjects were women aged 49.4  11.6 years, with onset of symptoms of 7.2  5.4 years, and time of diagnosis of 3.0  3.3 years."
1147,125,The mean ESSPRI was 6.87  1.97.
1148,125,"The intraobserver reproducibility was high and significant (0.911) and, with Bland-Altman method, there was no systematic bias in the agreement of measures among evaluations."
1149,125,A moderate correlation of ESSPRI with all tested instruments was observed.
1150,125,CONCLUSION: The Brazilian Portuguese version of ESSPRI is a valid and reproducible version.
1151,126,Ultrasound of the salivary glands is aspecific examination for detecting pathology of salivary glands in the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome.
1152,126,"It is easy to learn, rapidly performed, non-invasive and inexpensive."
1153,126,"Other imaging techniques, such as sialography and scintigraphy, are currently only rarely performed."
1154,126,"For the examination, linear ultrasound probes with frequencies between 7 and 12MHz are recommended."
1155,126,Such probes are already widely available to the rheumatologist performing musculoskeletal ultrasound.
1156,126,The parotid and submandibular glands are bilaterally scanned both in longitudinal and transverse planes as a standard.Normal salivary glands have uniformly hyperechoic and homogeneous tissue.
1157,126,They can be clearly delineated from the surrounding muscles and soft tissue and appear similar to the thyroid gland.
1158,126,The salivary glands are typically hypoechoic and inhomogeneous in Sjgren's syndrome.
1159,126,Focal or diffuse hypoechoic or anechoic foci are found in the glands.
1160,126,The submandibular glands may become atrophic (sagittal diameter <8mm).
1161,126,"Particularly in disease flares, the parotid glands may become enlarged (sagittal diameter >20mm)."
1162,126,The sensitivity for the diagnosis is 60 to 90% and the specificity is over 90%.Doppler sonography does not further improve the diagnostic accuracy.
1163,126,Sonography has thus become an important tool in the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome.
1164,127,"OBJECTIVE: Firstly, to investigate the pregnancy outcome of women with primary Sjogren's Syndrome (pSS) in a case-control study; secondly, to perform a review of the literature in order to clarify if the pregnancy outcome is affected by pSS and influenced by the disease clinical onset."
1165,127,METHOD OF STUDY: Thirty-four pregnancies with pSS and 136 controls were retrospectively collected.
1166,127,RESULTS: Six pregnancies occurred before the pSS diagnosis and 28 after the pSS diagnosis.
1167,127,Two cases were complicated by intrauterine atrio-ventricular block.
1168,127,"A statistically significant increase of the rate of spontaneous abortions, preterm deliveries and cesarean section was found in pSS pregnancies."
1169,127,The mean neonatal birth weight and the mean neonatal birth weight percentile were significantly lower in the offspring of women with pSS in comparison to controls.
1170,127,Similar pregnancy outcome was observed in women with pSS diagnosis before and after the index pregnancy.
1171,127,"CONCLUSIONS: Women with pSS experienced complicated pregnancies more frequently than controls, regardless of the onset of the symptoms, showing that the immunological disturbance is present throughout the reproductive life."
1172,128,"We report a unique case of Sjgren's syndrome complicated with Fanconi syndrome and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in a 53-year-old Chinese woman, initially found to have proteinuria, fatigue and multiple old costal fractures."
1173,128,"Distal tubular dysfunction is the most common renal damage in Sjgren's syndrome, while Fanconi syndrome (which is caused by proximal tubular dysfunction) and Hypothyroidism are rare complications of Sjgren's syndrome."
1174,129,Sjgren's syndrome is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocyte proliferation and progressive exocrine gland damage.
1175,129,"In China, standardized diagnosis and treatment for Sjgren's syndrome lags behind other common rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus."
1176,129,"Based on the evidence and guidelines from China and other countries, Chinese Sjgren's Syndrome Collaborative Research Group together with stomatologist and ophthalmologist developed Standardization of diagnosis and treatment of primary Sjgren's syndrome."
1177,129,"The purposes are: (1) to standardize the detection and interpretation of key indicators for the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome, including serum anti SSA antibody and labial gland pathology; (2) to suggest using widely accepted disease activity index in evaluation of the disease; (3) to standardize rational management for Sjgren's syndrome patients with topical and systemic diseases."
1178,130,Patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) may go undiagnosed or be misclassified due to the insidious nature and wide spectrum of the disease.
1179,130,The available several classification criteria emphasize glandular findings.
1180,130,We aimed to analyze the efficiency of various classification criteria sets in patients diagnosed on the clinical basis by expert opinion and to compare those pSS patients who fulfilled these criteria with those who did not.
1181,130,This is a multicenter study in which 834 patients from 22 university-based rheumatology clinics are included.
1182,130,Diagnosis of pSS was made on the clinical basis by the expert opinion.
1183,130,"In this study, we only interviewed patients once and collected available data from the medical records."
1184,130,"The European criteria, American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Sjogren's criteria were applied."
1185,130,Majority of the patients were women (F/M was 20/1).
1186,130,The median duration from the first pSS-related symptom to diagnosis was significantly shorter in men (2.52.3 vs 4.35.9years) (p=0<0.016).
1187,130,"When the European, AECG and ACR Sjogren's criteria were applied, 666 patients (79.9%) satisfied at least one of them."
1188,130,"In total, 539 patients (64.4%) satisfied the European, 439 (52.6%) satisfied the AECG, and 359 (43%) satisfied the ACR criteria."
1189,130,"Among the entire group, 250 patients (29.9%) satisfied all and 168 (20.1%) met none of the criteria."
1190,130,The rates of extraglandular organ involvements were not different between patients who met at least one of the criteria sets and those who met none.
1191,130,There is an urgent need for the modification of the pSS criteria sets to prevent exclusion of patients with extraglandular involvements as the dominant clinical features.
1192,131,OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of SS is often difficult and many patients are symptomatic for years with other diagnoses before confirmation of SS.
1193,131,Our aim was to determine whether overlapping clinical and serologic features with RA and SLE may in part drive the misdiagnoses.
1194,131,METHODS: A total of 1175 sicca patients were evaluated in a multidisciplinary clinic and classified as having SS based on the American-European Consensus Group Criteria.
1195,131,"They were interrogated for a past history of suspicion or diagnosis of RA, SLE or SSc."
1196,131,These diseases were confirmed or ruled out by applying the corresponding classification criteria if the patients responded affirmatively.
1197,131,"RESULTS: Of these, 524 (44.6%) subjects reported previous diagnosis or suspicion of RA, SLE or SSc, which was confirmed in 130 (24.8%) but excluded in 394 (75.2%) subjects."
1198,131,"Of those previously diagnosed with another illness, 183 (34.9%) met the criteria for primary SS."
1199,131,"RF was present in 70/191 patients with previous diagnosis of RA compared with 445/845 without a prior RA diagnosis (P = 3.38E-05), while 128/146 with a diagnosis of SLE had positive ANA compared with 622/881 without the diagnosis (P = 8.77E-06)."
1200,131,"Age also influenced former diagnoses: people with suspected RA were older than those without the diagnosis (P = 5.89E-06), while patients with SLE suspicion were younger (P = 0.0003)."
1201,131,"Interestingly, the previous diagnoses did not significantly delay a final classification of SS."
1202,131,"CONCLUSION: Among subjects classified as SS, the presence of a positive ANA or RF was associated with a previous, apparently erroneous diagnosis of SLE or RA, respectively."
1203,132,"OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to investigate women with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and sicca syndrome (SS), focusing on the prevalence of disease-related symptoms and their impact on sexual ability, relationship, communication about sexuality with partner and health professionals (HP)."
1204,132,"METHODS: Sixty-two women with pSS and 33 with SS were assessed for sexual activity, relationship with partner, communication about sex; for physical disability and body esteem, fatigue, disability, quality of life (QoL), anxiety and depression."
1205,132,"RESULTS: Around 55% patients had a relationship; >79% and around 70% at least 1 gynaecological (especially dryness), and 1 muscle-skeletal symptom, respectively; around 60% sex disability for disease-related symptoms, mainly dryness (p=NS for all comparisons between pSS and SS)."
1206,132,"In both groups, disease changed sexual activity (around 50%), causing limitation (around 50%) and reduced frequency (>80%) in sexual intercourses; sex pleasure and satisfaction were around 30% and 25% (p=NS for pSS vs. SS)."
1207,132,"Around 55% patients discussed with partner disease-effects on relationship; despite in around 70% partner understood difficulties, in around 34% disease altered relationship (p=NS for pSS vs. SS)."
1208,132,"Around 16% patients were asked by HP if disease affected sexuality, around 30% never approached anyone to discuss about sex (p=NS for pSS vs. SS)."
1209,132,"Disability, QOL, mood, fatigue, similar in pSS versus SS (p=NS), were not affected by xerostomia and xeroftalmia, but by sex concerns and sex disability."
1210,132,"CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pSS and SS present, often and at the same extent, gynaecological symptoms, leading to impaired sexual intercourse, affecting pleasure, satisfaction, sexual ability."
1211,133,"CONTEXT: Primary Sjgren syndrome is uncommon in children, and the standard clinical criteria used in diagnosis of adult Sjgren syndrome will miss many children with the disease."
1212,133,Floor of mouth ranulas have not been described in Sjgren syndrome.
1213,133,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe a novel presentation of juvenile primary Sjgren syndrome, and to present a comprehensive systematic review of the literature regarding the presentation and diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome in children."
1214,133,DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE.
1215,133,"STUDY SELECTION: A MEDLINE literature search was performed using the following search terms: primary, Sjgren, disease, and children."
1216,133,Results were limited to human subjects and articles written in English between 1981 and 2014.
1217,133,Applicable articles were reviewed and qualitatively summarized.
1218,133,DATA EXTRACTION: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRIMA).
1219,133,"RESULTS: Initial MEDLINE search yielded 146 articles, 80 of which were excluded as not clinically pertaining to Sjgren syndrome."
1220,133,An additional 25 were excluded due to lack of pediatric-specific data.
1221,133,Systematic review of the literature revealed no reports of ranula in association with Sjgren syndrome.
1222,133,6 papers were manually included from review of reference lists of included articles.
1223,133,"Our review indicated that recurrent parotitis is the most commonly reported presenting symptom in children, followed by ocular and oral symptoms, musculoskeletal, and renal symptoms."
1224,133,"Compared to adults, children are less likely to present with dry eyes and mouth."
1225,133,"LIMITATIONS: All studies were retrospective chart reviews, case series or case reports."
1226,133,CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a child presenting with floor of mouth ranulas in association with Sjgren syndrome.
1227,133,"While recurrent parotitis is the most common presentation in children, other salivary gland and extra-salivary manifestations may be seen, and the clinician must maintain a high index of suspicion for underlying Sjgren syndrome."
1228,134,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder associated with a variety of systemic presentations.
1229,134,Varied neurological dysfunctions of newly diagnosed adult patients with pSS have been observed in recent years.
1230,134,We aimed to describe a rare case of acute bilateral facial paralysis diagnosed with pSS for the first time and review the previous studies including similar cases.
1231,134,"A 69-year-old female, who had experienced ocular and oral dryness for more than 10years, presented with bilateral facial palsy."
1232,134,Her laboratory test results showed positive anti-Ro (SSA) and anti-Ro-52 antibodies.
1233,134,"Ophthalmic examination and test of saliva secretion verified xerophthalmia and xerostomia, respectively."
1234,134,"Other possibilities of Lyme disease, Mbius syndrome, tumor, bilateral temporal bone fracture, Guillain-Barr syndrome, central nervous system lymphoma and HIV infection were ruled out."
1235,134,A diagnosis of pSS associated with bilateral facial paralysis was made.
1236,134,The literature review revealed one article describing a similar patient.
1237,134,Our case was the only one suffering from acute bilateral facial palsy without other nerve involvement.
1238,134,The presence of such patients reveals that pSS is an underlying cause of acute bilateral facial paralysis.
1239,135,"Involvement of the respiratory system, in particular dry airways and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is common in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
1240,135,"As respiratory symptoms are also common in pSS patients and may have different etiologies, we wanted to evaluate the amount and impact of respiratory symptoms in out-patients with pSS and to assess if such symptoms are related to concomitant COPD."
1241,135,The St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was used to assess respiratory symptoms.
1242,135,"SGRQ scores were compared between 51 consecutive pSS patients, in an out-patient setting, and 80 population-based controls."
1243,135,"The patients were also studied by pulmonary function tests and CT scans of the lungs to assess signs of obstructive airway disease, including COPD, as well as to assess signs of interstitial lung disease (ILD)."
1244,135,"41 and 18% of pSS patients were found to have COPD and radiographic signs of ILD, respectively."
1245,135,"pSS patients had significantly higher SGRQ scores compared to controls, but no significant differences in SGRQ scores were found between patients with and without COPD."
1246,135,Neither did the small group of pSS patients with ILD significantly differ in SGRQ scores in comparison to patients without ILD.
1247,135,"Respiratory symptoms were common in pSS, but were not more common in patients with concomitant COPD."
1248,135,"Since pulmonary involvement in pSS is associated with an increased mortality and respiratory symptoms is a poor marker for pulmonary involvement, we suggest that pulmonary function tests should be performed liberally in all pSS patients regardless of symptoms."
1249,136,"OBJECTIVE: To define the clinical, serological, and histopathological characteristics of primary (pSS) and secondary Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
1250,136,"METHODS: Fifty subjects with pSS and 300 with connective tissue diseases (CTD; systemic lupus erythematosus 100, rheumatoid arthritis 100, scleroderma 100) were selected randomly from our patient registry."
1251,136,"Selected patients were assessed for fulfillment of the American-European Consensus Group criteria for SS using a 3-phase approach: screening (European questionnaire, Schirmer-I test, wafer test), confirmatory (fluorescein staining test, nonstimulated whole salivary flow, anti-Ro/La antibodies), and lip biopsy (H&E and immunohistochemical staining for anti-CD20 and anti-CD45RO scored by morphometry)."
1252,136,RESULTS: All patients with pSS and 65 with CTD met criteria for SS.
1253,136,"Oral symptoms (pSS = 92% and secondary SS = 84%; p = 0.02), parotid enlargement (pSS 56%, secondary SS 9.2%; p < 0.001), and higher prevalence (pSS 82%, secondary SS 41%; p < 0.001) and titers of anti-Ro/La antibodies were more common in pSS."
1254,136,"Extraglandular manifestations were similar in both groups, except for Raynaud's phenomenon, which was more common in those with secondary SS (pSS 16% vs secondary SS 41%; p = 0.001)."
1255,136,These results remained after 3 different sensitivity analyses.
1256,136,"The prevalence of focal infiltration was also similar in both SS varieties; however, a higher B:T cell ratio and higher expression of CD20 cells (2922 vs 607.5 positive cells; p < 0.001) were observed in pSS."
1257,136,CONCLUSION: A higher frequency of oral symptoms and parotid enlargement and stronger B cell activity (autoantibody production and lymphocyte infiltration) were observed in pSS.
1258,136,Whether these results reflect a true difference between the 2 disease entities or derive from underlying variables remains uncertain.
1259,137,RATIONALE: Behcet disease(BD) and Sjogren syndrome(SS) are separate conditions that rarely concomitantly affect an individual.
1260,137,"In theory,mild symptoms of patients with BD or SS are easy to igore and,thus,remain undiagnosed."
1261,137,"There,it is reasonable to believe there may be some clinical cases of combined diseases that go undiscovered and which needs to be taken seriously."
1262,137,"In addition,it has been suggested that herpes simplex virus(HSV) types 1 and 2 are associated with BD,but have not been shown to be correlated to the direct pathogenesis of BD."
1263,137,The role of HSV in BD needs more research and attention.
1264,137,"PATIENT CONCERNS: Here,we report a young woman who had both BD and SS."
1265,137,The first symptom of the disease was fever.
1266,137,"However,the HSV type 1 IgG and HSV type 2 IgM antibody results were positive in our case and,which rendered this case unique."
1267,137,"DIAGNOSES: BD and SS concomitantly affect the individual,and BD was the acute type."
1268,137,"INTERVENTIONS: IV methylprednisolone was used for 9 days and then oral glucocorticoids was used to instead,and the treatment works very well."
1269,137,"OUTCOMES: BD and SS can concomitantly affect an individual,and we believe that HSV-2 may be directly related to the pathogenesis of BD."
1270,137,"The nature of BD as an auto-inflammatory disorder, autoimmune disorder, or both, is controversial."
1271,137,"If we can find more patients who combined affected these two disease, it might helpful for us to understand the nature of BD."
1272,137,"LESSONS: For patients with clinical diagnosis of BD or SS,we need to be alert that it may combinded the other disease."
1273,137,Long term follow up and detailed inspection are important means to avoid undiscovered.
1274,138,"In this preliminary study, we employed surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of saliva and serum samples for diagnosing Sjogren's syndrome (SjS), a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by dryness of the mouth and eyes."
1275,138,The saliva and serum samples from n=29 patients with SjS and n=21 controls were deproteinized with methanol and then the SERS spectra were acquired using silver nanoparticles synthesized by reduction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride.
1276,138,"In the case of both saliva and serum, the SERS spectra were dominated by similar bands attributed to purine metabolites such as uric acid, xanthine, and hypoxanthine."
1277,138,"Principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) models built from SERS spectra of saliva and serum yielded an overall classification accuracy of 94% and 98%, respectively."
1278,138,"These results suggest that the SERS analysis of saliva and serum is able to capture the complex biochemical perturbations that accompany the onset of SjS, a strategy which could be translated in the future into a novel point-of-care diagnosis method."
1279,138,Graphical abstract.
1280,139,Multiple sclerosis (MS) is very similar to the Sjgren's syndrome (SS) by its clinical presentations.
1281,139,"Features found in common between the two disorders include symptoms of lesions of the brain, spinal cord and optic tract, the detection of autoantibodies, such as antinuclear, anti-Ro, anti-La and the prevalence of MRI abnormalities such as periventricular and subcortical lesions."
1282,139,Almost all symptoms found in patients with the CNS-SS involvement described above could be attributed to the concomitant presence of MS.
1283,139,"Therefore, the differential diagnosis of these diseases is difficult."
1284,139,The paper addresses clinical and biological presentations of similarity of and differences between MS and SS in the diagnostic aspect.
1285,140,"Although infrequent, the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) during the course of Sjgren's syndrome represents a major complication."
1286,140,"Nethertheless, most NHL developing in patients with Sjgren's syndrome are B cell lymphomas involving the marginal zone, localized to extranodal sites."
1287,140,"Predictive factors include lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, neutropenia, cryoglobulinemia and low C4 levels."
1288,140,The treatment of B cell lymphomas depends on its nature and localization.
1289,140,"Biotherapies targeting the B lymphocyte, such as rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, or more recently targeting BAFF can be proposed."
1290,141,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of impaired gastric emptying (IGE) and its relation to autonomic nervous dysfunction (AD), functional bowel syndrome, and inflammatory and serological variables in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
1291,141,METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with pSS according to the American-European Consensus Criteria were included in the study.
1292,141,Gastric emptying was evaluated by the octanoate breath test from which half-time (t(half)) and lag-time (t(lag)) were determined and compared with the results from 50 healthy controls.
1293,141,Autonomic nervous function was evaluated by 5 objective autonomic reflex tests (ART) and by the Autonomic Symptom Profile (ASP) questionnaire evaluating AD symptoms.
1294,141,These results were compared with previously investigated healthy ART controls and population-based ASP controls.
1295,141,Patients were also assessed regarding symptoms of functional bowel syndrome.
1296,141,RESULTS: The t(half) and the t(lag) were significantly prolonged in patients compared to controls.
1297,141,Forty-three percent of patients with pSS presented signs of IGE and 29% fulfilled the criteria for gastroparesis.
1298,141,Significant correlations were found between t(lag) and increased levels of IgG (p = 0.02) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; p = 0.01).
1299,141,"In addition, rheumatoid factor (RF) seropositives showed objective signs of IGE to a greater extent than RF seronegatives."
1300,141,"No associations between IGE, ART variables, ASP variables, or gastrointestinal symptoms were found."
1301,141,CONCLUSION: IGE was common in pSS.
1302,141,Associations with inflammatory and serological features of pSS could imply immunological mechanisms behind the IGE.
1303,141,Objective signs of IGE were not associated with objective signs or subjective symptoms of AD or functional bowel syndrome.
1304,142,AIMS: To assess the prevalence and determine predictors of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in patients with clinically significant aqueous-deficient dry eye.
1305,142,"METHODS: Patients enrolled in an industry-sponsored, multicentre clinical trial (NCT00784719) were assessed prospectively for the presence of SS."
1306,142,"Ocular testing included Schirmer test, corneal fluorescein staining, conjunctival lissamine green staining, and tear-film breakup time."
1307,142,"Review of systems questionnaire, medical history, dry eye questionnaire and laboratory work-up (Sjgren-specific antibody A (SSA), Sjgren-specific antibody B (SSB), rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibody (ANA)) were obtained."
1308,142,"RESULTS: Of 327 patients, 38 (11.6%) had SS: 21 (6.4%) with primary SS (pSS), and 17 (5.2%) with secondary SS."
1309,142,Nine patients (3%) were newly diagnosed using the applied diagnostic criteria based on American-European consensus criteria.
1310,142,"Patients with SS had significantly worse conjunctival and corneal staining, Schirmer test (with and without anaesthesia), and symptoms compared with patients without SS."
1311,142,pSS Was significantly more likely to occur in patients with positive ANA (OR: 13.9) and RF (OR: 4.8).
1312,142,CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmologists caring for patients with clinically significant dry eye should have a high index of suspicion for underlying SS and low threshold for serological work-up.
1313,142,RF and ANA are recommended as useful tests in SSA/SSB-negative patients for further diagnostic referral.
1314,143,"OBJECTIVES: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a complex chronic systemic disorder, for which specific and effective therapeutic interventions are still lacking."
1315,143,"In this era of precision medicine, there is a clear need for a better definition of disease phenotypes to foster the research of novel specific biomarkers and new therapeutic targets."
1316,143,"The main objectives of this work are: 1) to compare Auto Contractive Map (AutoCM), a data mining tool based on an artificial neural network (ANN) versus conventional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in discriminating different pSS subsets and 2) to specifically focus on variables predictive of MALT-NHL development, assessing the previsional gain of the predictive models developed."
1317,143,"METHODS: Out of a historic cohort of 850 patients, we selected 542 cases of pSS fulfilling the AECG criteria 2002."
1318,143,"Thirty-seven variables were analysed including: patient demographics, glandular symptoms, systemic features, biological abnormalities and MALT-NHLs."
1319,143,AutoCM was used to compute the association of strength of each variable with all other variables in the dataset.
1320,143,PCA was applied to the same data set.
1321,143,"RESULTS: Both PCA and AutoCM confirmed the associations between autoantibody positivity and several pSS clinical manifestations, highlighting the importance of serological biomarkers in pSS phenotyping."
1322,143,"However, AutoCM allowed us to clearly distinguish pSS patients presenting with predominant glandular manifestations and no or mild extra-glandular features from those with a more severe clinical presentation."
1323,143,"Out of 542 patients, we had 27 cases of MALT-NHLs."
1324,143,"The AutoCM highlighted that, besides other traditional lymphoproliferative risk factors (i.e."
1325,143,"salivary gland enlargement, low C4, leukocytopenia, cryoglobulins, monoclonal gammopathy, disease duration), rheumatoid factor was strongly associated to MALT-NHLs development."
1326,143,"By applying data mining analysis, we obtained a predictive model characterised by a sensitivity of 92.5% and a specificity of 98%."
1327,143,"If we restricted the analysis to the seven most significant variables, the sensitivity of the model was 96.2% and its specificity 96%."
1328,143,"CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shed new light on the possibility of using novel tools to extract hidden, previously unknown and potentially useful information in complex diseases like pSS, facing the challenge of disease phenotyping as a prerequisite for discovering novel specific biomarkers and new therapeutic targets."
1329,144,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the manifestation of meibomian gland dysfunction in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS), non-Sjgren's syndrome dry eye (non-SS) patients, and non-dry eye controls."
1330,144,"METHODS: We recruited 31 participants with SS dry eye, 30 participants with non-SS dry eye, and 35 healthy controls without dry eye symptoms."
1331,144,Noninvasive tear breakup time (NITBUT) and meibomian gland dropout score (meiboscore) were measured using the Oculus Keratograph 5M.
1332,144,Meibomian gland expressibility and secretion quality were evaluated via slit lamp biomicroscopy.
1333,144,The correlation between measurements was analyzed.
1334,144,"RESULTS: NITBUT was lower, and the meiboscore, meibomian gland expressibility, and secretion quality scores were significantly higher in the SS and non-SS groups than in the control group (p<0.001)."
1335,144,"NITBUT was lower, and the meiboscore and meibomian gland expressibility were higher in the SS group than in the non-SS group."
1336,144,NITBUT correlated negatively with the meiboscore in both SS and non-SS groups and with meibomian gland expressibility in the SS group.
1337,144,A positive correlation was obtained between meiboscore and meibomian gland expressibility in both the SS and the non-SS groups.
1338,144,CONCLUSION: Patients in both SS and non-SS groups exhibited greater impairment in meibomian gland function than the non-dry eye controls.
1339,144,SS patients had more severe meibomian gland dysfunction with poorer mean meiboscore and meibomian gland expressibility than non-SS patients.
1340,145,OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to evaluate systemic disease activity of pediatric Sjgren's syndrome (SS) using European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI).
1341,145,"METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with SS who have been diagnosed according to 1999 Japanese diagnostic criteria for SS before 16 years old at KKR Sapporo Medical Center, Hokkaido University Hospital, and affiliated hospitals."
1342,145,We analyzed clinical and laboratory data and calculated ESSDAI at both diagnosis and peak activity.
1343,145,RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (2 boys and 23 girls) were enrolled.
1344,145,Only 4 patients had sicca symptoms at diagnosis.
1345,145,"Mean ESSDAI scores at diagnosis and peak activity were 12.68 (2-31) and 15.08 (2-38), respectively."
1346,145,Only 3 patients were inactive (ESSDAI score<5) at diagnosis.
1347,145,"Frequently involved domains at diagnosis were the biological (96%) followed by the constitutional (68%), glandular (44%), articular (44%), cutaneous domains (28%), renal (16%), and central nervous system (12%)."
1348,145,"At peak activity, biological domain (96%) was followed by the constitutional (72%), glandular (60%), articular (44%), cutaneous (28%), central nervous system (20%), and renal domains (16%)."
1349,145,CONCLUSION: Pediatric SS is suspected from active systemic manifestations.
1350,145,The items of ESSDAI are useful clues to the diagnosis of pediatric SS.
1351,146,"OBJECTIVE: The objectives are to detect the frequency of sicca symptoms and Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) based on the diagnostic criteria of the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and to evaluate demographic, clinical and serologic characteristics."
1352,146,PATIENTS AND METHOD: One hundred and eighteen SSc patients referred to our hospital were included in this study.
1353,146,All SSc patients were questioned with respect to sicca symptoms.
1354,146,"Levels of rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies were measured; non-stimulated saliva amounts were recorded and Schirmer test and break-up time were applied to all patients."
1355,146,"Minor salivary gland biopsy samples were obtained from those patients giving 3 positive answers to sicca symptom questions, patients with positive xerostomia/xerophthalmia test results, and patients with at least one antibody being positive."
1356,146,Patients presenting with grade 3 and/or grade 4 sialoadenitis based on Chisholm criteria were considered pathological.
1357,146,RESULTS: Sicca symptoms were present in 84 of 118 patients with SSc (71.2%).
1358,146,Minor salivary gland biopsy samples were obtained from 74 patients.
1359,146,Grade 3 and/or grade 4 sialoadenitis was detected in 40 (33.9%) patients and they were diagnosed with SS.
1360,146,"Compared to patients diagnosed with SSc alone, systemic sclerosis patients diagnosed with SS had lower pulmonary hypertension and less diffuse lung involvement."
1361,146,"Statistically significant difference was detected in terms of sclerodactylia and telangiectasia between SSc-SS and SSc patient groups (P=0.045 and P=0.011, respectively)."
1362,146,"Serological assessments revealed that in the SSc-SS group, 13 patients were anti-Ro antibody positive, six were anti-La antibody positive and 37 were anti-topoisomerase 1 antibody positive."
1363,146,"RF, ANA and anti-centromere antibody levels were higher in the SSc-SS group."
1364,146,"CONCLUSION: In the present study, highly frequent sicca symptoms and Sjgren's syndrome based on AECG criteria were noted in patients with systemic sclerosis."
1365,146,The SSc-SS patient group had less severe clinical course and lung involvement.
1366,147,OBJECTIVE: Minor salivary gland biopsy is one of the objective tests used in the diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome.
1367,147,The aim of our study was to compare the clinical and laboratory data of primary and secondary Sjgren syndrome cases with a lymphocyte score 3 and 4 in the minor salivary gland biopsy.
1368,147,MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data from a total of 2346 consecutive minor salivary gland biopsies were retrospectively evaluated in this study.
1369,147,Clinical and autoantibody characteristics of 367 cases with lymphocyte score 3 or 4 and diagnosed with primary or secondary Sjgren syndrome were compared.
1370,147,"RESULTS: There was no difference between lymphocyte score 3 and 4 primary Sjgren syndrome patients in terms of dry mouth, dry eye symptoms and Schirmer test results but Anti-Ro and Antinuclear Antibody positivity was statistically significantly higher in cases with lymphocyte score 4 (p= 0.025, p= 0.001)."
1371,147,Anti-Ro test results were also found to be statistically significantly higher in secondary Sjgren syndrome patients with lymphocyte score 4 (p= 0.048).
1372,147,"CONCLUSION: In this study, the high proportion of cases with negative autoantibody but positive lymphocyte score is significant in terms of showing the contribution of minor salivary gland biopsy to Sjgren syndrome diagnosis."
1373,147,Lymphocyte score 3 and 4 cases were found to have similar clinical findings but a difference regarding antibody positivity in primary Sjgren syndrome.
1374,147,We believe that cases with lymphocyte score 4 may be Sjgren syndrome cases whose clinical manifestations are relatively established and higher autoantibody levels are therefore found.
1375,148,"INTRODUCTION: Recently, a great interest has arisen for salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) as a valuable tool for the assessment of major salivary gland involvement in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS."
1376,148,The aims of this study were to test the accuracy of SGUS for the early detection of pSSand to compare the diagnostic performance of SGUS with minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) and unstimulated salivary flow (USFR) in this context.
1377,148,METHOD: Patients with suspected pSS and symptoms duration of 5 years were consecutively enrolled in this study.
1378,148,The diagnosis of pSS was made according to the AECG criteria.
1379,148,SGUS was performed by two radiologists blinded to the diagnosis and a previously reported ultrasound scoring system (De Vita et al.
1380,148,"1992, cut-off  1) was used to grade the echostructure alterations of the salivary glands."
1381,148,Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v16.
1382,148,RESULTS: This study included 50 pSS patients and 57 controls with no-SS sicca symptoms.
1383,148,"The mean(SD) age of the pSS group was lower than non-SS group (47(13) vs 53(12)yrs, p = 0.006)."
1384,148,No further differences between the two groups were observed.
1385,148,"Patients with pSS showed a significantly higher SGUS score in comparison with controls (mean(SD) = 2.1(1.8) vs 0.0(0.4), p = 0.000)."
1386,148,"The SGUS cut-off  1 showed a sensitivity (SE) of 66 %, a specificity (SP) of 98 %, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 97 % and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 73 % for pSS diagnosis."
1387,148,The SGUS score correlated also with patients' MSGB/FS and USFR.
1388,148,CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the good performance of SGUS for the early non-invasive diagnosis of pSS.
1389,148,Further research in larger international cohort of patients is mandatory in order to assess the role of SGUS in the diagnostic algorithm of pSS.
1390,149,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome is one of the most common systemic autoimmune disorders, whose diagnosis is very often delayed."
1391,149,In most cases it is a mild disease with symptoms such as dryness and musculoskeletal pain and fatigue but 20-40% of patients suffer from severe systemic manifestations.
1392,149,"Extraglandular manifestations can be the first sign of the disease, therefore it is very important to diagnose them as early as possible."
1393,149,Classification criteria established by the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) have been applied in primary Sjgren's syndrome diagnosis since 2002.
1394,149,"They took both subjective - dryness of eyes and mouth - and objective tests - imaging and functional tests of salivary glands, ocular tests, histopathologic test of minor salivary glands and presence of typical autoantibodies - into account."
1395,149,New classification criteria proposed in 2012 by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) include objective tests only.
1396,149,Most recent research data suggest that noninvasive ultrasound examination of salivary gland should be included in the diagnostics process of Sjgren's syndrome due to its high specificity values which are comparable to those obtained from minor salivary glands biopsy.
1397,149,"Also, it is important to evaluate disease activity in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome using a score index - ESSDAI (EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index)."
1398,150,Sjgren's syndrome (SS--Sjgren's Syndrom) is an autoimmune systemic disease of connective tissue.
1399,150,"The aim of this study was to present the contemporary literature on the basis of the pathophysiology of the Sjgren's syndrome, with particular reference to the pathogenesis of the damage to the salivary glands."
1400,150,"It also discusses the criteria for classification, aetiology and pathogenesis of the SS, as well as the clinical symptoms of the disease in the oral cavity and its influence on the composition of the saliva."
1401,150,The knowledge of the Sjbgren's syndrome is important for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.
1402,151,We are presenting the case of a 53-year-old woman with a history of Sjgren syndrome and a secondary antiphospholipid syndrome admitted at the Nephrology department for the evaluation of renal failure.
1403,151,"The patient was initially diagnosed with tubulointerstitial nephritis and subsequently a membranoproliferative type I glomerulonephritis, secondary to cryoglobulins during the course of the disease."
1404,151,Repeated renal biopsies were required to confirm the diagnosis.
1405,152,"The aim of this retrospective, single-centre study was to investigate the clinical and laboratory features and disease outcomes of 547 patients diagnosed with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) between 1975 and 2010."
1406,152,The patients were followed up for 11.46.2 years.
1407,152,"We evaluated the clinical and laboratory features, and assessed their influence on the time of diagnosis, survival, and mortality ratios, and compared them within subgroups defined by gender, glandular and extraglandular manifestations (EGMs), associated diseases, and immunoserological abnormalities."
1408,152,"The most frequent EGMs were polyarthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon, and vasculitis among our patients; the most common associated disease was thyroiditis."
1409,152,"During the follow-up period, 51 patients died; the median survival time was 33.71 years."
1410,152,"Our results revealed a negative effect of cryoglobulinemia on survival ratios; additionally, the presence of vasculitis and lymphoproliferative diseases at the time of diagnosis increased the risk of mortality."
1411,152,The development of vasculitis was the most powerful predictor of mortality.
1412,152,Mortality in the group of patients with extraglandular symptoms was two- to threefold higher than in the glandular group.
1413,152,Attention is drawn to the importance of close monitoring and targeted diagnostic approaches in those pSS subgroups with obviously increased mortality risk.
1414,153,OBJECTIVES: To develop a score for assessment of patients' symptoms in primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS): the EULAR SS Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI).
1415,153,"METHODS: Dryness, pain, somatic and mental fatigue were identified as the main symptoms of patients with primary SS, in studies developing the Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort (PROFAD) and Sicca Symptoms Inventory (SSI)."
1416,153,It was suspected that a single 0-10 numerical scale for each domain was sufficient to assess these symptoms.
1417,153,These four scales were gathered to form the ESSPRI.
1418,153,"230 patients, from 12 countries completed the ESSPRI, SSI and PROFAD questionnaires and a 0-10 patient global assessment (PGA)."
1419,153,Correlations between each symptom and PGA were obtained.
1420,153,"Multiple regression modelling, using PGA as 'gold standard' was used to select domains and estimate their weights."
1421,153,"RESULTS: PGA had good correlation with dryness, limb pain, fatigue and mental fatigue (r=0.49-0.59, all p<0.0001), but correlated less well with individual dryness features."
1422,153,"In multivariate analysis, dryness, limb pain and fatigue, but not mental fatigue, were significantly associated with PGA; weights derived from the regression were identical for these three domains."
1423,153,"Thus, ESSPRI was redefined as the mean of the three scales: dryness, limb pain and fatigue."
1424,153,"Lastly, ESSPRI significantly correlated with PGA (r=0.70), PROFAD (r=0.73) and SSI (r=0.66)."
1425,153,CONCLUSION: ESSPRI is a very simple index designed to measure patients' symptoms in primary SS.
1426,153,It has good construct validity and is well correlated with SSI and PROFAD.
1427,153,ESSPRI should now be validated for use as an outcome measure in clinical trials.
1428,154,BACKGROUND: The objective was to evaluate concordance between 2002 American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and to assess how salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) might improve the classification of patients.
1429,154,"METHODS: Patients with suspected pSS underwent a standardised evaluation, including SGUS, at inclusion into the single-centre Brittany DIApSS cohort."
1430,154,Agreement between the two criteria sets was assessed using Cohen's  coefficient.
1431,154,Characteristics of discordantly categorised patients were detailed.
1432,154,"RESULTS: We prospectively included 290 patients between 2006 and 2016, among whom 125 (43%) met ACR/EULAR criteria and 114 (39%) also met AECG criteria; thus, 11 (4%) patients fulfilled only ACR/EULAR, no patients AECG only, and 165 (57%) patients neither criteria set."
1433,154,Concordance was excellent (=0.92).
1434,154,"Compared to patients fulfilling both criteria sets, the 11 patients fulfilling only ACR/EULAR criteria had similar age and symptom duration but lower frequencies of xerophthalmia and xerostomia (p<0.01 for each) and salivary gland dysfunction (p<0.01); most had systemic involvement (91%), including three (27%) with no sicca symptoms; 91% had abnormal salivary gland biopsy and 46% anti-Sjgren's-syndrome-related antigen A (anti-SSA); 64% were diagnosed with pSS by the physician."
1435,154,SGUS was abnormal in 12% of the 165 patients fulfilling no criteria set.
1436,154,Including SGUS among the ACR/EULAR criteria increased sensitivity from 87.4% to 91.1% when physician diagnosis was the reference standard.
1437,154,CONCLUSIONS: Agreement between AECG and ACR/EULAR criteria sets is excellent.
1438,154,ACR/EULAR criteria are slightly more sensitive and classified some patients without sicca symptoms as having pSS.
1439,154,Including SGUS in the ACR/EULAR criteria may further improve their sensitivity.
1440,155,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the principal determinants of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) impairment in patients with active primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) participating in a large therapeutic trial, Tolerance and Efficacy of Rituximab in Primary Sjgren's Syndrome (TEARS)."
1441,155,"METHODS: At the inclusion visit for the TEARS trial, 120 patients with active primary SS completed the Short Form 36 health survey (SF-36), a validated HRQOL assessment tool."
1442,155,"Univariate then multivariate linear regression analyses were used to assess associations linking SF-36 physical and mental components to demographic data, patient-reported outcomes (symptom intensity assessments for dryness, pain, and fatigue, including the European League Against Rheumatism [EULAR] Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index [ESSPRI]), objective measures of dryness and autoimmunity, and physician evaluation of systemic activity (using the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index [ESSDAI])."
1443,155,RESULTS: SF-36 scores indicated marked HRQOL impairments in our population with active primary SS.
1444,155,"Approximately one-third of the patients had low, moderate, and high systemic activity according to the ESSDAI."
1445,155,ESSPRI and ESSDAI scores were moderately but significantly correlated.
1446,155,"The factors most strongly associated with HRQOL impairment were patient-reported symptoms, best assessed using the ESSPRI, with pain and ocular dryness intensity showing independent associations with HRQOL."
1447,155,"Conversely, systemic activity level was not associated with HRQOL impairment in multivariate analyses, even in the patient subset with ESSDAI values indicating moderate-to-high systemic activity."
1448,155,"CONCLUSION: The cardinal symptoms of primary SS (dryness, pain, and fatigue, best assessed using the ESSPRI) are stronger predictors of HRQOL impairment than systemic involvement (assessed by the ESSDAI) and should be used as end points in future therapeutic trials focusing on patients' well-being."
1449,155,New consensual and data-driven response criteria are needed for primary SS studies.
1450,156,OBJECTIVES: The value of salivary gland scintigraphy in the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome remains controversial.
1451,156,The primary aim of this study was to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of salivary gland scintigraphy in the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome among 237 patients with xerostomia.
1452,156,METHODS: We retrospectively compared eight scintigraphy parameters between 106 Sjgren patients and 131 non-Sjgren patients.
1453,156,"RESULTS: Seven of the eight parameters were significantly decreased in patients with Sjgren; however, their diagnostic accuracy was low, with areas under the curves (AUCs) ranging from 0.58 (95% CI 0.50-0.65) to 0.63 (95% CI: 0.55-0.70)."
1454,156,"The prestimulatory oral activity index allowed discrimination between primary and secondary Sjgren's syndrome (AUC 0.73, 95% CI: 0.62-0.84), and the secretion velocity for parotid glands allowed discrimination between patients with Sjgren and burning mouth syndrome (AUC 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.82)."
1455,156,"CONCLUSION: The accuracy of scintigraphy parameters for the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome among patients with xerostomia was low; however, some functional indices appeared to assist discrimination between primary and secondary SS patients and between subgroups of patients with different causes of xerostomia."
1456,157,BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria play an important role in making an earlier diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients presenting with clinically isolated syndrome.
1457,157,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to determine whether MRI criteria may be used to distinguish MS from primary and secondary central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis, lupus, and Sjogren's syndrome."
1458,157,"METHODS: MRI criteria were applied retrospectively to images for patients with clinically definite MS (CDMS), primary CNS vasculitis, secondary CNS vasculitis, and autoimmune disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjogren's syndrome."
1459,157,Classical statistics and Bayesian analyses were performed.
1460,157,"RESULTS: Overall modified Barkhof's MRI criteria were statistically significant in distinguishing CDMS (60%) from SLE/Sjogren's syndrome (17%, p = 0.0173) but not in distinguishing CDMS from primary CNS vasculitis (50%, p = 0.7376) or secondary CNS vasculitis (58%, p = 1.0000)."
1461,157,"Four of the five other MRI criteria tested were demonstrated to be superior to modified Barkhof's criteria in predicting MS: nine or more T2 lesions (a component of Barkhof's criteria), one or more ovoid periventricular T2 lesions, one or more perpendicular periventricular T2 lesions, and one or more T2 lesions larger than 6 mm."
1462,157,"CONCLUSIONS: MRI criteria, including the modified Barkhof's criteria, were unsuccessful in distinguishing MS from primary CNS vasculitis or secondary CNS vasculitis and mildly successful in distinguishing MS from SLE/Sjogren's syndrome."
1463,158,BACKGROUND: Human -fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) is a hydrolase the importance of which has been increasing in the latest years.
1464,158,"However, data about its plasma level in children with autoimmune disorders, particularly Sjgren's syndrome (SS), are lacking."
1465,158,"In this study, the plasma activity of L--fucosidase-1 (-L-FUCA-1) was assayed in hospitalized children and adults and its association with SS and other rheumatic disorders further evaluated."
1466,158,"METHODS: In total 73 Hungarian hospitalized patients, 32 children (2.5-10years) and 41 adults (32-68years), were enrolled in the study and underwent plasma assay of -L-FUCA1 activity."
1467,158,"Linear regression, Durbin-Watson (DW), and Pearson tests were evaluated to investigate the relationship between -L-FUCA-1 plasma levels and autoimmune manifestations."
1468,158,"RESULTS: -L-FUCA-1 correlated with SS both in children (2-sided t test, P=0.0023) and in adults (2-sided t test, P=0.00035)."
1469,158,"Linear regressions showed that in other rheumatic disorders, -L-FUCA1 did not show any differential distribution related to the particular pathology (r=0.2042, P=0.1531, DW test=2.2139 positive), while this trend was radically opposite for patients with SS (r=0.1462, P=0.0032, DW test=1.3664, negative)."
1470,158,CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in plasma level of -L-FUCA-1 were significantly associated with SS.
1471,158,This preliminary result should encourage further research on -L-FUCA-1 as a possible differential serological marker of SS.
1472,159,OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of salivary gland biopsy supernatants (the secretome) as a novel tool to aid in stratification of patients with sicca syndrome and to study local immunopathology in Sjgren's syndrome.
1473,159,METHODS: Labial salivary gland biopsies were incubated in saline for 1 hour.
1474,159,"In these tissue supernatants from a discovery cohort (n=16) of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and non-Sjgren's sicca (nSS), 101 inflammatory mediators were measured by Luminex."
1475,159,"Results were validated in a replication cohort (n=57) encompassing patients with pSS, incomplete SS and nSS."
1476,159,RESULTS: The levels of 23 cytokines were significantly increased in patients with pSS versus nSS in the discovery cohort.
1477,159,These 23 and 3 additional cytokines were measured in a second cohort.
1478,159,Elevated concentrations of 11 cytokines were validated and the majority correlated with clinical parameters.
1479,159,"Classification tree analysis indicated that the concentrations of CXCL13, IL-21, sIL-2R and sIL-7R could be used to classify 95.8% of patients with pSS correctly."
1480,159,"CONCLUSION: Labial salivary gland secretomes can be used to reliably assess mediators involved in immunopathology of patients with pSS, potentially contributing to patient classification."
1481,159,"As such, this method represents a novel tool to identify therapeutic targets and markers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response."
1482,160,"Sjogren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder which affects the exocrine glands with lymphocytic infiltration, and occasionally involves central nervous system."
1483,160,It is usually rare and manifests as a lesion in the trigeminal nerve.
1484,160,Our case discusses the involvement of the oculomotor and abducens nerves along with the prevalence of such cases as seen on literature review.
1485,160,We describe a case of a middle aged woman who presented with ophthalmoplegic symptoms.
1486,160,The symptoms resolved in response to steroid therapy and serum analysis was positive for anti SSA antibodies.
1487,160,Increasing use of imaging modalities has enabled identifying cranial nerve enhancements easily.
1488,160,"Correlating this to serum analysis, as in our case; has helped identify more cases of third and sixth cranial nerve involvement than was previously known to occur with primary Sjogren's syndrome."
1489,161,"A clinical picture of dry eye and dry mouth with the histological counterpart of focal lymphocytic sialoadenitis, usually detected in minor salivary glands, is considered the hallmark of Sjgren's syndrome."
1490,161,"The association of sicca complaints and focal sialoadenitis can be also found in a number of other diseases, including some systemic viral infections."
1491,161,"Among these conditions, chronic hepatitis C virus infection, associated with mixed cryoglobulinaemia and extra-hepatic manifestations, and HIV infection, particularly in the phase of diffuse interstitial lymphocytic infiltration, may mimic the clinical and histological aspects of Sjgren's syndrome."
1492,161,"However, each disorder is characterised by specific, disease-related immunopathological aspects."
1493,161,"Besides sicca complaints, the various disorders may also share a number of systemic extra-glandular features and the possible development of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas."
1494,161,This latter event represents in all of these diseases the final result of an antigen-driven chronic stimulation of B lymphocytes.
1495,162,OBJECTIVES: To characterize the interstitial cystitis (IC) associated with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
1496,162,METHODS: Report of three new cases.
1497,162,Only cases fulfilling the American-European consensus criteria for SS and the European Society for the Study of Interstitial Cystitis criteria with positive histological findings for IC were included.
1498,162,"RESULTS: Thirteen cases of SS and IC have been reported in women, including the three reported here, with a mean age of 54 years."
1499,162,"SS appeared first in 77% (n=10) of cases, a mean of 6.6years before IC."
1500,162,"The symptoms of IC included pollakiuria (n=11), lower abdominal pain (n=8), urinary urgency (n=5), painful micturition (n=6), hematuria (n=3) and dysuria (n=3)."
1501,162,"Urinary dilatation occurred in three cases, leading to acute renal failure in two patients."
1502,162,The diagnosis of IC was confirmed by anatomical evidence of cystitis inflammation on bladder biopsy in all (n=13) patients.
1503,162,"Treatment was reported for nine patients, seven of whom (78%) received corticosteroid treatment, which was partially or completely effective in six cases."
1504,162,"Immunosuppressive treatment was added in three cases (cyclosporine, n=2; azathioprine, n=1; cyclophosphamide, n=1)."
1505,162,"Local bladder treatments were performed, with hydraulic distension in five cases and DMSO instillation in one patient."
1506,162,A urinary catheter was inserted in the two cases of acute obstructive renal failure.
1507,162,CONCLUSIONS: Urinary symptoms without infection should lead the physician to consider a diagnosis of IC in SS patients.
1508,162,"Urinary dilatation may occur, leading to acute obstructive renal failure."
1509,162,Corticosteroid treatment may be effective and local treatments have been tried.
1510,163,"OBJECTIVES: This study estimated the diagnostic performance of a deep learning system for detection of Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) on CT, and compared it with the performance of radiologists."
1511,163,METHODS: CT images were assessed from 25 patients confirmed to have SjS based on the both Japanese criteria and American-European Consensus Group criteria and 25 control subjects with no parotid gland abnormalities who were examined for other diseases.
1512,163,10 CT slices were obtained for each patient.
1513,163,"From among the total of 500 CT images, 400 images (200 from 20 SjS patients and 200 from 20 control subjects) were employed as the training data set and 100 images (50 from 5 SjS patients and 50 from 5 control subjects) were used as the test data set."
1514,163,The performance of a deep learning system for diagnosing SjS from the CT images was compared with the diagnoses made by six radiologists (three experienced and three inexperienced radiologists).
1515,163,"RESULTS: The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the deep learning system were 96.0%, 100% and 92.0%, respectively."
1516,163,"The corresponding values of experienced radiologists were 98.3%, 99.3% and 97.3% being equivalent to the deep learning, while those of inexperienced radiologists were 83.5%, 77.9% and 89.2%."
1517,163,The area under the curve of inexperienced radiologists were significantly different from those of the deep learning system and the experienced radiologists.
1518,163,"CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning system showed a high diagnostic performance for SjS, suggesting that it could possibly be used for diagnostic support when interpreting CT images."
1519,164,PURPOSE: To measure the tear menisci in Sjgren's syndrome dry eye (SSDE) by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to determine its relationships with the clinical tests.
1520,164,"METHODS: Twenty-six SSDE, 26 non-SSDE, and 26 control subjects completed the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) before OCT determination of upper tear meniscus volume (UTMV), lower tear meniscus volume (LTMV), and total tear meniscus volume (TTMV)."
1521,164,"These were followed by measurements of noninvasive tear breakup time (NITBUT), fluorescein tear breakup time (FTBUT), fluorescein staining, Schirmer test, and corneal confocal microscopy."
1522,164,"RESULTS: UTMV, LTMV, and TTMV were the lowest in SSDE among the three groups (P < 0.05)."
1523,164,"High sensitivity and specificity of UTMV (1.0; 0.96), LTMV (0.92; 0.92), and TTMV (0.96; 0.96) were found in the diagnosis of SSDE."
1524,164,"For SSDE, the areas under the UTMV, LTMV, and TTMV receiver operating characteristic curves were larger than those in NITBUT, FTBUT, and Schirmer test (P < 0.005)."
1525,164,"In the SSDE group, NITBUT was correlated with UTMV (R = 0.41) and TTMV (R = 0.39) (P < 0.05)."
1526,164,"Fluorescein staining score was significantly correlated with UTMV (R = -0.46), LTMV (R = -0.41), and TTMV (R = -0.53) (P < 0.05)."
1527,164,"Superficial epithelial cell density was correlated with UTMV (R = 0.18), LTMV (R = 0.51), and TTMV (R = 0.44) (P < 0.05)."
1528,164,CONCLUSIONS: Tear menisci volumes estimated by OCT may have great potential in the diagnosis and monitoring of SSDE.
1529,164,They can also reflect ocular surface damage and tear film stability.
1530,165,OBJECTIVE: To determine the usefulness and prognostic value of a simplified salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) scoring system in primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
1531,165,METHODS: Patients with primary SS (n = 105) and controls (n = 57) were evaluated using a simplified SGUS scoring system.
1532,165,"Parenchymal homogeneity in salivary glands was graded from 0 to 3, with grades 0 (normal) and 1 (mild inhomogeneity) being interpreted as normal or unspecific, and grades 2 (several rounded) and 3 (numerous or confluent hypoechoic lesions) as primary SS typical."
1533,165,"Associations between SGUS and clinical, histologic, and laboratory disease characteristics were analyzed."
1534,165,RESULTS: The characteristic hypoechoic lesions (score 2 or 3) were found in 52% of primary SS patients and in 1 (1.8%) of controls (P < 0.001).
1535,165,"Specificity and positive predictive value of abnormal SGUS for primary SS were both 98%, sensitivity and negative predictive values were 52% and 53%, respectively."
1536,165,Age or disease duration did not influence the SGUS result.
1537,165,Dryness did not differ between normal or abnormal SGUS.
1538,165,"However, patients with pathologic SGUS had significantly more often signs and symptoms of systemic complications, higher disease activity, and more frequently markers of lymphoma development, such as salivary gland swelling, skin vasculitis, germinal center-like structures in salivary gland biopsy findings, and CD4+ T cell lymphopenia."
1539,165,CONCLUSION: SGUS using a simplified score for assessment of parenchyma dyshomogeneity is highly specific for primary SS and offers the advantage of identifying patients with severe disease or at risk of lymphoma.
1540,165,"However, early disease may be missed."
1541,165,SGUS is easy and rapidly performed and may be considered as an item in future modified classification criteria.
1542,166,"OBJECTIVES: Several chronic inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, have been linked to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE)."
1543,166,"However, the data on Sjgren's syndrome (SS) remain unclear."
1544,166,This study aimed to investigate this association.
1545,166,"METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that reported odds ratio, relative risk, hazard ratio or standardised incidence ratio comparing risk of VTE in patients with SS versus non-SS subjects."
1546,166,"Pooled risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird."
1547,166,"RESULTS: Out of 306 potentially relevant articles, four eligible studies were identified and included in the data analysis."
1548,166,"The pooled risk ratio of VTE in patients with SS was 2.05 (95% CI, 1.86-2.27)."
1549,166,The statistical heterogeneity of this study was insignificant with an I2 of 0%.
1550,166,CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a statistically significant increased VTE risk among patients with SS.
1551,167,"OBJECTIVE: To validate the revised Japanese Ministry of Health criteria for the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) (JPN) (1999), The American-European Consensus Group classification criteria for SS (AECG) (2002), and American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SS (ACR) (2012)."
1552,167,"METHODS: The study subjects were 694 patients with SS or suspected SS who were followed-up in June 2012 at ten hospitals that form part of the Research Team for Autoimmune Diseases, The Research Program for Intractable Disease by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW)."
1553,167,"All patients had been checked for all four criteria of the JPN (pathology, oral, ocular, anti-SS-A/SS-B antibodies)."
1554,167,We studied the clinical diagnosis made by the physician in charge and the satisfaction of the above criteria.
1555,167,"RESULTS: Of the 694 patients, 499 patients did not have other connective tissue diseases (CTDs)."
1556,167,"SS was diagnosed in 476 patients (primary SS in 302, secondary SS in 174), whereas non-SS was diagnosed in 218 patients (without other CTDs in 197, with other CTDs in 21) by the physician in charge."
1557,167,"The sensitivities of JPN, AECG, and ACR in the diagnosis of all forms of SS (both primary and secondary SS) were 79.6, 78.6, and 77.5%, respectively, with respective specificities of 90.4, 90.4, and 83.5%."
1558,167,"The sensitivities of the same systems in the diagnosis of primary SS were 82.1, 83.1, and 79.1%, respectively, with specificities of 90.9, 90.9, and 84.8%, respectively."
1559,167,"The sensitivities of the same systems in the diagnosis of secondary SS were 75.3, 70.7, and 74.7%, respectively, with specificities of 85.7, 85.7, and 71.4%, respectively."
1560,167,"CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of JPN to all forms of SS and secondary SS, the sensitivity of AECG to primary SS, and the specificities of JPN and AECG for all forms of SS, primary SS, and secondary SS were highest in the diagnosis of SS in Japanese patients."
1561,167,These results indicate that the JPN criteria for the diagnosis of SS in Japanese patients are superior to ACR and AECG.
1562,168,BACKGROUND: Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a rare relapsing auto-immune disease of the central nervous system which is sometimes found in association with other autoimmune disorders including Sjogren's syndrome.
1563,168,We present the case of a middle aged female with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) who had a rapidly declining neurological illness that responded to immunosuppressive therapy.
1564,168,CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old female with Sjogren's syndrome and recent history of varicella zoster infection presented with right upper and lower extremity weakness of one week duration.
1565,168,She was noted to have contrast enhancement at C2-C4 cord levels on cervico-thoracic MRI.
1566,168,Comprehensive work up was negative except for presence of a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and oligoclonal bands in the CSF.
1567,168,She was diagnosed with transverse myelitis secondary to varicella zoster infection and was treated with high dose steroids in addition to acyclovir with improvement in her symptoms.
1568,168,"Two months later she developed left upper and lower extremity weakness, bilateral dysesthesias and urinary incontinence."
1569,168,Repeat MRI of the cervico-thoracic spine revealed worsening enhancement at lower cervical cord levels (C5-7) with extension to T1.
1570,168,CSF analysis was unchanged; however immunological work up was abnormal for elevated NMO-IgG/AQP4 antibody.
1571,168,She was diagnosed with NMOSD and was treated with immunosuppressive therapy.
1572,168,Initially with IV methylprednisone and Cyclophosphamide therapy followed by Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) maintenance therapy with good response.
1573,168,Repeat MRI 6months later showed near complete resolution of previous abnormal cord signal changes.
1574,168,CONCLUSION: One needs to recognize the relationship between autoimmune diseases especially SS and NMOSD.
1575,168,"The presence of NMO antibody has been associated with a relapsing disease course and a careful follow-up, besides use of remission maintenance agents such as MMF and Azathioprine are important to consider."
1576,169,OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of sialography and salivary ultrasonography (US) for Sjgren's syndrome (SS) patients.
1577,169,"METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochran library, and performed two meta-analyses on the diagnostic accuracy of sialography and salivary US in SS patients."
1578,169,RESULTS: A total of six studies including 488 patients and 447 controls from two European and four Asian studies were available for the meta-analysis.
1579,169,"The pooled sensitivity and specificity of sialography were 80.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76.4-83.2) and 89.0% (85.8-91.8), respectively, and 77.4 (73.7-80.9) and 81.5 (77.6-85.0) for US, respectively."
1580,169,"For sialography, the PLR, NLR, and DOR were 9.296 (4.200-20.57), 0.228 (0.170-0.305), and 46.51 (16.14-134.0), respectively, and for US were 4.631 (2.707-7.864), 0.302 (0.226-0.403), and 17.48 (10.03-30.45), respectively."
1581,169,"The area under the curve (AUC) of sialography was 0.824, and the Q* index was 0.757, while the AUC of US was 0.864, and its Q* index was 0.794, indicating that the diagnostic accuracy of US is comparable with sialography in SS patients."
1582,169,A subgroup meta-analysis according to the diagnostic criteria did not change the overall diagnostic accuracy.
1583,169,CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis of published studies demonstrates that the diagnostic accuracy of salivary US is comparable with sialography in SS patients.
1584,170,"INTRODUCTION: There is no information available regarding the relationship between the respiratory symptoms or lung function and bronchial inflammation, measured by induced sputum."
1585,170,"OBJECTIVES: Description of the clinical characteristics, radiographic images and lung function of patients suffering from Primary Sjgren Syndrome (PSS), and to assess the relationship with the inflammatory airway profile."
1586,170,"METHODS: We analysed clinical, radiology, lung function tests, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and inflammatory data in the induced sputum from 36 consecutive patients with PSS."
1587,170,RESULTS: A total of 58% of patients had hoarseness and 42% had cough and dispnea.
1588,170,"No lung dysfunction was observed, although 46% (n=16) had a positive bronchial response."
1589,170,Lymphocytosis >2.6% in induced sputum was observed in 69% of all sputa.
1590,170,"There was chronic cough in 29% of patients with lymphocytosis (n=24), whereas 73% were normal (n=11) (P=.02)."
1591,170,The duration time of cough was less for the former (P=.02).
1592,170,On the contrary a positive bronchial response was associated with lymphocytosis >2.6% (P=.02).
1593,170,Lipophages were present in 55% of pathological sputa (n=22) (index >15) versus 18% of the non-pathological ones (n=11) (P=.05).
1594,170,"CONCLUSION: Hoarseness, cough and dyspnea are frequent respiratory symptoms in PSS, although there is a wide variation in the relationship with bronchial responsiveness and airway inflammation."
1595,170,"Lymphocytosis in the airways is another site of the infiltrative process in PSS, and the induced sputum is a complementary tool in the identification of active inflammatory process."
1596,171,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the infiltration of lymphocytes in exocrine glands, specifically the salivary and lacrimal glands, resulting in the typical symptoms of xerophthalmia and xerostomia."
1597,171,"SS may be accompanied by pleural effusion when the lung is involved, but this occurrence has been reported in only 10 cases in the literature."
1598,171,We report the case of a 42 year-old woman with severe bilateral pleural effusion for eight years.
1599,171,"Primary Sjgren's Syndrome was finally diagnosed based on the presence of xerophthalmia and xerostomia, biopsy of the minor salivary glands, and positive anti-SS-A antibody in the serum and pleural effusion."
1600,171,Biopsy of the parietal pleura through video-assisted thoracoscopy revealed infiltration of lymphocytes.
1601,171,The patient had a long history of pleural effusion without clear etiology.
1602,171,"Malignant disease was first suspected because of abnormal density lesion on the left lung and malignant cells found on cytology, but PET-CT revealed no malignant lesion."
1603,171,"Examinations did not support infection, malignant tumor, pulmonary sarcoidosis, or other connective tissue diseases."
1604,171,This data could be useful for the future study of pleural effusion in SS.
1605,172,Fatigue and generalised pain are debilitating symptoms that negatively impact the quality of life in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
1606,172,"Chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and fatigue are the clinical hallmarks of fibromyalgia (FM), a clinical entity which can be associated to connective tissue disease."
1607,172,"The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of FM syndrome, fatigue and widespread pain in SLE and pSS patients and to evaluate the contribution of inflammatory disease and FM on those constitutional symptoms."
1608,172,Fifty SLE and 50 pSS patients were enrolled in the study.
1609,172,"Patients rated fatigue, pain, and disease activity using a 100-mm visual analogue scale and completed the Health Assessment Questionnaire and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire."
1610,172,Zung depression and anxiety scales were used to quantify mood disorders.
1611,172,Tender points were evaluated using an algometer.
1612,172,Disease activity score as evaluated for each SLE and pSS patient.
1613,172,"Fibromyalgia has been diagnosed in a significantly higher percentage of SLE patients than pSS patients (32% vs. 18%, p=0.022) even if the percentage of patients reporting fatigue and pain was higher among pSS patients."
1614,172,No correlation with disease activity was observed in either group of patients.
1615,172,"FM seems to contribute to constitutional symptoms more in SLE than in pSS, suggesting a different underlying cause of fatigue and widespread pain in these two different connective tissue diseases."
1616,173,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was the assessment of semi-quantified salivary gland dynamic scintigraphy (SGdS) parameters independently and in an integrated way in order to predict primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
1617,173,MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients (41 females; age 6111years) with sicca syndrome were studied by SGdS after injection of 200MBq of pertechnetate.
1618,173,"In sixteen patients, pSS was diagnosed, according to American-European Consensus Group criteria (AECGc)."
1619,173,Semi-quantitative parameters (uptake (UP) and excretion fraction (EF)) were obtained for each gland.
1620,173,ROC curves were used to determine the best cut-off value.
1621,173,The area under the curve (AUC) was used to estimate the accuracy of each semi-quantitative analysis.
1622,173,"To assess the correlation between scintigraphic results and disease severity, semi-quantitative parameters were plotted versus Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI)."
1623,173,A nomogram was built to perform an integrated evaluation of all the scintigraphic semi-quantitative data.
1624,173,RESULTS: Both UP and EF of salivary glands were significantly lower in pSS patients compared to those in non-pSS (p<0.001).
1625,173,ROC curve showed significantly large AUC for both the parameters (p<0.05).
1626,173,"Parotid UP and submandibular EF, assessed by univariated and multivariate logistic regression, showed a significant and independent correlation with pSS diagnosis (p value <0.05)."
1627,173,No correlation was found between SGdS semi-quantitative parameters and ESSDAI.
1628,173,The proposed nomogram accuracy was 87%.
1629,173,CONCLUSION: SGdS is an accurate and reproducible tool for the diagnosis of pSS.
1630,173,ESSDAI was not shown to be correlated with SGdS data.
1631,173,CLINICAL RELEVANCE: SGdS should be the first-line imaging technique in patients with suspected pSS.
1632,174,OBJECTIVE: Clinimetric tools are useful in both clinical practice and research of Sjgren's syndrome.
1633,174,These instruments assist in the establishment of diagnosis and in the evaluation of disease status.
1634,174,"We reviewed the available methods used to monitor sicca signs and symptoms, fatigue, quality of life as well as activity/chronicity in SS."
1635,174,"METHODS: PubMed and MEDLINE database were searched for the keywords ""keratoconjunctivitis sicca diagnosis,"" ""dry eye and dry mouth assessment,"" ""sialometry,"" ""sialochemistry,"" ""Sjgren's syndrome outcomes,"" ""Sjgren's syndrome activity,"" ""Sjgren's syndrome damage,"" ""fatigue scales in Sjgren's syndrome,"" and ""Sjgren's syndrome quality of life."""
1636,174,All relevant articles and pertinent secondary references were reviewed.
1637,174,"RESULTS: As there is a moderate correlation between sicca symptoms and signs, the assessment of both is crucial."
1638,174,"Most of the tests focus on oral and ocular dryness (vital dye staining, tear quantification, tear composition, sialometry, sialochemistry, etc.)"
1639,174,and may not be disease specific.
1640,174,"Symptoms such as dryness and fatigue have been evaluated with different instruments, being the PROFAD and ESSPRI disease-specific tools."
1641,174,"Standardized measures for activity (SSDAI, SCAI, and ESSDAI) and chronicity (SSDDI and SSDI) indexes are currently used, however these methods still present limitations such as low external validity and cross-validation."
1642,174,"CONCLUSION: The heterogeneous nature of the disease and its slow progression, challenge the evaluation of these patients."
1643,174,The use of composite measures might increase our ability to diagnose and evaluate disease activity and cumulative irreversible organ injury in this disease.
1644,174,However the distinction among oral and ocular activity vs. damage is still a matter of research.
1645,175,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a complex autoimmune disease characterised by local exocrine glandular involvement and systemic multiorgan manifestations.
1646,175,"In this review we will discuss the value of the histological examination of the salivary glands in the classification criteria, and more recently as prognostic tool for patient stratification and monitoring."
1647,175,The limitations of the current tools used to assess salivary gland pathology in pSS will also be reviewed in relation to using salivary gland biopsy analysis as an outcome measure in clinical trials.
1648,176,The lip biopsy is essential for the diagnosis of primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) but an invasive method can cause some disadvantages.
1649,176,The purpose of this study is to apply Raman spectroscopy to detect the pathological minor salivary glands in primary SS and establish the diagnostic model of Raman spectra of the primary SS samples.
1650,176,Raman spectra from the primary samples and control samples were obtained by Raman microscope and were compared to find the differences.
1651,176,The principal component analysis (PCA) and discrimination function analysis (DFA) were employed to analyze the spectra and establish the diagnostic model.
1652,176,The differences of Raman spectra demonstrated the biochemical molecular alterations between the different samples.
1653,176,"Compared with the control samples, the content of proteins, nucleic acids, and keratin increased in the primary SS samples but the content of lipids decreased."
1654,176,PCA and DFA displayed a powerful role in the classification of the Raman spectra.
1655,176,"The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic model reached above 91 and 92%, respectively."
1656,176,The total accuracy is 92.4%.
1657,176,"Raman spectroscopy combined with PCA-DFA algorithm will provide an effective and accurate technology for the diagnosis of the pathological minor salivary glands in primary SS, which may replace the lip biopsy in the future."
1658,177,"Major salivary gland (SG) ultrasonography (US) represents a noninvasive, nonirradiating imaging modality for evaluation of the major SGs in the diagnosis and follow-up of primary and secondary Sjgren syndrome."
1659,177,"Structural changes can be visualized as hyperechogenic and hypoechogenic areas, inhomogeneity, and altered echogenicity in general."
1660,177,"The reliability of SG-US is poorly investigated, and the definition of US abnormalities varies in previously published studies."
1661,177,Recent studies have shown correlations between SG-US findings and focus score in the minor SGs; however further studies are needed to validate a US criterion in updated classification/diagnostic criteria.
1662,178,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that can occur as a unique existence (primary Sjgren's syndrome) or merge with other systemic diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis or systemic sclerosis (secondary Sjgren's syndrome)."
1663,178,Data on the two diseases occurrence order are inadequate.
1664,178,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) may relatively uncommonly lead to diffuse cystic lung changes.
1665,178,We represent a female who was diagnosed pSS with diffuse cystic lung alterations developed SLE two years later.
1666,178,"SS was diagnosed on account of the existence of dryness of eye and mouth, Schirmer's test, biopsy of the minor salivary glands of her lip, positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibody in the serum."
1667,178,Chest computed tomography image showed bilateral diffuse cystic changes with a wide variation in cyst size and distribution.
1668,178,"SLE was finally diagnosed based on bilateral lower limb skin rash, gonarthritis and omarthritis, low level of complement, antinuclear antibody 1:640 and positive antibodies to double-stranded DNA."
1669,178,"Improvement was achieved with therapy of corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics."
1670,178,"This report provides us clinical, diagnosis and treatment perception of SS-onset SLE as patient presenting diffuse cystic lung changes."
1671,179,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease most commonly characterized by ocular and oral dryness.
1672,179,"Despite the high prevalence of SS, generation and perpetuation of this disease is still unclear in many aspects."
1673,179,"Inflammation, nonetheless, seems to play a central role in this pathology especially in the form of Th-1, Th-2 and Th-17 cytokines release within different aspects, concentrations and connections involved in the maintenance of the syndrome."
1674,179,"Moreover, the chronically created pro-inflammatory environment appears to promote glandular atrophy and irreparable architectural modifications."
1675,179,The establishment of germinal centers (GC) in SS are considered the main reason for the 16-times increased probability of lymphoproliferative disease development in these patients.
1676,179,"SS is also interconnected with numerous others auto-inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, many of them representing the first clear sign of a dysregulated immune system."
1677,179,"Despite the recent advances, treatment options are still insufficient."
1678,179,"This overview aims to better elucidate this local and systemic disease, which can be of vital use not only for SS but also to other rheumatic pathological conditions."
1679,180,BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the inf luence of poor sleep quality on clinical features of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
1680,180,"METHODS: Sleep quality was cross-sectionally assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected from 115 Korean patients with pSS."
1681,180,"The patients completed questionnaires on the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) SS Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), quality of life (EuroQOL five dimensions questionnaire [EQ-5D]), fatigue (fatigue severity score [FSS]), and depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] II])."
1682,180,Symptoms and patient global assessment (PGA) were evaluated with a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS).
1683,180,"The EULAR sicca score (ESS), ESSPRI, and EULAR SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) were calculated at study enrollment."
1684,180,RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (46.1%) had poor sleep quality and 32.4% of 71 patients without depression were poor sleepers.
1685,180,"Poor sleepers had a significantly lower EQ-5D or ESSDAI and a significantly higher FSS, BDI-II, PGA, ESS, ESSPRI, or VAS scores for extra-glandular symptoms than good sleepers."
1686,180,Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were significantly higher and immunoglobulin G levels tended to decrease in poor sleepers.
1687,180,"Additionally, PSQI was negatively correlated with EQ-5D and ESSDAI and positively with ESS, FSS, BDI-II, PGA, VAS scores for their symptoms, and ESSPRI."
1688,180,Multivariate analysis revealed that poor sleep quality remained the independent determinants of the unsatisfactory symptom state (ESSPRI  5).
1689,180,CONCLUSION: Our results showed that poor sleep quality could significantly affect the patient-oriented outcomes and physician-reported activity index of pSS patients through the various effects of sleep quality on the psychological or somatic symptoms and the immune system.
1690,181,"Differential diagnosis of patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS), IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) and SS patients having high risk for lymphoma (LHR) can be challenging."
1691,181,Some patients with IgG4-RD might be misdiagnosed as having SS.
1692,181,There are special symptoms of SS that raise the possibility of IgG4-RD whereas other symptoms identify patients as having LHR.
1693,181,"The purpose of this study was to characterize and compare patients with SS, possible IgG4-RD and SS patients with LHR."
1694,181,"Sixty-five SS patients were divided into 4 subgroups according to having possible IgG4-RD (n=15), LHR (n=16), eligible for both aforementioned groups (n=20) and not eligible for either group (n=14), respectively."
1695,181,Four patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD.
1696,181,"The serum levels of IgG4 were significantly higher in patients suspicious for IgG4-RD compared to that of LHR patients (0.46g/l vs. 0.12g/l, p=0.032)."
1697,181,"Shared features of the patient groups (salivary gland swelling (SGS) and lymphadenopathy), were separately analysed: SGS patients had higher IgG4/IgG ratio (p=0.036), lymphadenopathic patients had higher IgG4 levels (p=0.042)."
1698,181,"Some patients may be ""hidden"" under the diagnosis of SS."
1699,181,"Although patients with LHR and patients with possible IgG4-RD share some symptoms, they differ significantly regarding IgG4 levels and IgG4/IgG ratio."
1700,182,"PURPOSE: Common etiologies of acute acquired cerebellar ataxia include cerebrovascular diseases, toxin or drugs, infections/para-infections, and autoimmune diseases."
1701,182,"It is a rare manifestation of Sjgren's syndrome, which is a common autoimmune disease but is often missed as a differential diagnosis."
1702,182,CASE REPORT: This is a report of a patient with acute onset cerebellar ataxia for one month.
1703,182,She also had massive neck lymphadenopathy.
1704,182,"After a series of studies and the exclusion of other common causes of acute cerebellar ataxia, she was diagnosed as having Sjgren's syndrome."
1705,182,"Patients with Sjgren's syndrome have higher risk for lymphoma, which leads to poorer prognosis."
1706,182,"After lymph node biopsy, the patient was proven to have sinus histiocytosis, which is another rare finding in Sjgren's syndrome."
1707,182,"DISCUSSION: For patients with acute acquired cerebellar ataxia, immune-mediated cerebellar ataxia should be an important differential diagnosis aside from the more common causes like stroke or drugs."
1708,183,"BACKGROUND: IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a recently recognized fibro-inflammatory disorder, which may affect many organs, and often comes to clinical attention due to tumor-like organ swelling or is identified incidentally by specific biopsy findings."
1709,183,"Typical histopathology of IgG4-RD is lymphoplasmacytic infiltration rich in IgG4+plasma cells (PCs), storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis."
1710,183,Patients with sicca symptoms can be misdiagnosed as primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) instead of IgG4-RD because of clinical and histopathological similarities.
1711,183,"Moreover, an association with lymphoma development is described in both diseases."
1712,183,This study investigated signs of IgG4-RD in a population-based cohort of patients diagnosed with pSS complicated by lymphoma.
1713,183,METHODS: Patients with pSS and lymphoma diagnoses and available lymphoma specimens were identified by linkage with the Swedish Patient Register 1964-2007 and the Cancer Register 1990-2007 (n=79).
1714,183,Clinical data and lymphomas were reviewed and the diagnoses evaluated.
1715,183,All lymphoma tissues and available minor salivary gland biopsies (n=11) were immunostained for IgG4+PCs and evaluated for other histopathological signs of IgG4-RD.
1716,183,"In a case with specific findings of IgG4-RD, other available tissue specimens of the same patient were investigated for IgG4-RD."
1717,183,"RESULTS: Only one patient of 79 (1.3%) had>10 IgG4+PCs/high power field (HPF) in the lymphoma tissue, an unspecified low-grade B-cell lymphoma localized in the submandibular gland."
1718,183,"This patient also had other histopathological features of IgG4-RD in the lymphoma and a surgical lung biopsy taken five years before lymphoma diagnosis and, therefore, fulfilled the criteria for IgG4-RD."
1719,183,Occasional IgG4+PCs (<10/HPF) without signs of IgG4-RD were observed in another six lymphomas.
1720,183,No IgG4+PCs were identified in the minor salivary gland biopsies.
1721,183,CONCLUSION: Histopathological findings of IgG4-RD may co-exist with low malignant B-cell lymphoma in patients with initially suspected pSS and may be associated with an underlying IgG4-RD.

1725,184,"RESULTS: The diagnosis of SS was established in 30 patients, among whom there were only 5 (16.7%) boys, the ratio of boys and girls was 1:5."
1726,184,"According to the results of the examination, the following diagnoses were verified: 4 - primary SS, 9 - systemic lupus erythematosus with SS, 10 - juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with SS, 3 - mixed connective tissue disease, 3 - overlap syndrome, 1 - systemic sclerosis with SS."
1727,184,The median age of rheumatic disease onset was 10.4 (7.0; 13.75) years.
1728,184,The median of disease duration at the time of SS verification - 3.0 (0.85; 4.4) years.
1729,184,Recurrent parotitis were observed in 8 patients.
1730,184,"24 pts had isolated involvement of salivary glands, 6 - combined with lacrimal glands."
1731,184,Sicca syndrome was occurred in 8 patients.
1732,184,"All patients had systemic manifestations: constitutional abnormalities - 50%, polyarthritis - 83.3%, lymphadenopathy - 73.3%, cutaneous involvement - 60%, pulmonary involvement - 23.3%."
1733,184,"Of the hematological disorders, leuko/lymphopenia was more often recorded - in 30%, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia - in 26.7% of patients."
1734,184,"ANA were detected in all cases, anti-Ro antibodies - 60%, a positive rheumatoid factor - 56.7% of patients."
1735,184,"The most common combination of immunological disorders was the presence of ANA, RF and anti-Ro antibodies (40% of patients)."
1736,184,"The treatment for each patient was justified by the main manifestations and activity of rheumatic disease: 66.7% received nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs, 80% - glucocorticoids, 46.7% - methotrexate, 20% - azathioprine, 43.3% - hydroxychloroquine, 10% - mycophenolatis mofetilum, 3.4% - cyclophosphamide."
1737,184,66.7% of patients received the treatment of Biologics.
1738,184,CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis of SS in children with rheumatic diseases significantly affects to the choice of treatment and prognosis.
1739,184,In children the SS has no clinical manifestations for a long time.
1740,184,"Such symptoms as a hypergammaglobulinemia, positive RF without persistant arthritis, nonspecific skin lesions, recurrent parotid swelling may help to diagnosis of SS."
1741,185,Noninvasive objective salivary gland ultrasonography (SGU) had been widely used to evaluate major salivary gland involvement in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and treatment responses.
1742,185,"However, the evaluation score, diagnostic sensitivity, and diagnostic specificity significantly varied among clinical studies."
1743,185,We conducted this meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of different SGU scoring systems using the American-European Consensus Group criteria.
1744,185,"Of the 1301 articles retrieved from six databases, 24 met the criteria for quality assessment and 14 for meta-analyses."
1745,185,"The pooled sensitivities were 75% (0-4) with I(2)=92.0%, 84% (0-16) with I(2)=63.6%, and 75% (0-48) with I(2)=90.9%; the pooled specificities were 93% (0-4) with I(2)=71.5%, 88% (0-16) with I(2)=65.4%, and 95% (0-48) with I(2)=83.9%; the pooled diagnostic odds ratios were 71.26 (0-4) with I(2)=0%, 46.3 (0-16) with I(2)=73.8%, and 66.07 (0-48) I(2)=0%; the areas under the SROC curves were 0.95 (0-4), 0.93 (0-16), and 0.94 (0-48)."
1746,185,"These results indicated that the 0-4 scoring system has a higher specificity and a less heterogeneity than other systems, and could be used as a universal SGU diagnostic standard."
1747,186,OBJECTIVES: To investigate the utilisation of eye disorder-related ambulatory medical services prior to the diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome in female Taiwanese patients.
1748,186,"DESIGN: A nationwide, population-based case-control study."
1749,186,SETTING: Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database.
1750,186,PARTICIPANTS: A total of 347 patients with a diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome from 2005 to 2010 and 1735 controls frequency matched on 10-year age interval and index year were identified from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database.
1751,186,"Diagnoses of eye disorder (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) codes from 360 to 370) were retrospectively screened to 1997."
1752,186,MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The utilisation of eye disorder-related medical service over different intervals prior to diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome between cases and controls were compared using generalised estimating equations with negative binomial distribution and log link function.
1753,186,RESULTS: A significantly higher proportion of patients with Sjgren's syndrome (7.5%) utilised eye disorder-related ambulatory medical services over an 8-year interval prior to the diagnosis of the disease compared with controls (4.8%).
1754,186,"The annual frequency of utilisation of eye disorder-related ambulatory medical services increased significantly faster when closer to the index date in patients with Sjgren's syndrome compared with controls (interaction effect, p=0.010)."
1755,186,"Subgroup analyses indicated that the changes over time in the utilisation of services related to disorders of lacrimal system (interaction effect, p=0.019) and conjunctiva (interaction effect, p=0.066) were significantly greater in patients with Sjgren's syndrome compared with controls."
1756,186,CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the utilisation of eye disorder-related ambulatory medical services was observed in patients with Sjgren's syndrome several years prior to the diagnosis of the disease.
1757,186,General practitioners and ophthalmologists can play an important role by including Sjgren's syndrome in the diagnostic evaluation of their patients afflicted with relevant symptoms.
1758,187,"Dry eye and dry mouth symptoms are each reported by up to 30% of persons more than 65 years of age, particularly in women."
1759,187,Medication side effects are the most common contributing factors.
1760,187,The evaluation of these symptoms requires measures of ocular and oral dryness.
1761,187,Sjgren syndrome is the prototypic disease associated with dryness of the eyes and mouth and predominantly affects women in their perimenopausal and postmenopausal years.
1762,187,"In addition to topical treatment of the mucosal dryness, patients with Sjgren syndrome may require treatment with systemic immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents to manage a variety of extraglandular manifestations."
1763,188,"OBJECTIVES:  To assess the frequency of clinical features of Sjogren's syndrome (SS) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) receiving treatment with disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) or nave to treatment and the possible association with clinical, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters."
1764,188,"METHODS:  A multicentre cross-sectional observational study was designed, based on a structured neurologist-administered questionnaire to 440 patients."
1765,188,RESULTS:  Twenty-eight of 230 (12%) patients receiving treatment with DMDs (DMDs(+)) and 14 of 210 (6.6%) treatment-nave patients (DMDs(-) ) showed clinical features of SS.
1766,188,"Four primary SS were diagnosed, two of which were DMDs(+) and two were DMDs(-) ."
1767,188,"Sicca symptoms were significantly associated with higher EDSS scores (P = 0.018), a low frequency of gadolinium-enhanced MRI-positive lesions (P = 0.018) and cerebral disturbances (P = 0.001)."
1768,188,CONCLUSIONS: Screening for the clinical features of SS should be performed in patients with MS both receiving treatment with immunomodulatory drugs and without therapy.
1769,189,OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) rests on a converging set of clinical and laboratory findings.
1770,189,Salivary-gland ultrasonography (SGUS) was recently shown to assist in the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of pSS.
1771,189,Our objective here was to measure salivary-gland elasticity using Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) ultrasonography in patients with pSS and to compare the results to those obtained in healthy controls.
1772,189,METHODS: SGUS with ARFI elastometry was performed in 10 patients with pSS and 15 healthy controls.
1773,189,Ten impulses per gland were used for both submandibular and both parotid glands of each participant.
1774,189,Mean shear wave velocity (SWV) in m/s was compared between the patients and controls using the Mann-Whitney U test.
1775,189,"RESULTS: For the parotid glands, mean SWV was significantly higher in the pSS group than in the control group (2.3350.315 vs 1.7850.384, respectively; P=0.001)."
1776,189,"Mean SWV values for the submandibular glands were not significantly different between the patients and controls (1.8120.308 vs 1.7660.187, respectively; P=0.892)."
1777,189,"CONCLUSION: ARFI elastometry may contribute to the diagnosis of pSS, as this noninvasive, fast, and inexpensive investigation can demonstrate abnormal architectural changes in the parotid glands."
1778,190,Parotitis is a frequent disease in general pediatrics.
1779,190,"Pneumoparotitis is a rare affection that belongs to differential diagnoses of parotitis, along with infections, lymphadenitis, autoimmune disorders, inflammatory conditions, vascular malformations or neoplasms."
1780,190,It is usually described in musicians using wind instruments or in other situations involving a Vasalva maneuver.
1781,190,We report the case of a 12 years old boy with severe idiopathic pneumoparotitis without any of these well-known causes and whose autoimmune familial background of Sjgren syndrome might be relevant.
1782,191,OBJECTIVES: To study and compare the clinical and serological features of patients with elderly versus adult and younger onset of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
1783,191,METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively 336 consecutive pSS patients followed at our unit.
1784,191,"They were subdivided into three groups according to the age at disease onset: elderly (>65 years), adult (>40 and 65 years), and young (40 years)."
1785,191,"Clinical and immunological features of the disease, labial salivary glands biopsy, ocular and oral tests were collected at time of diagnosis and then compared among the three groups."
1786,191,"RESULTS: In 21 (6%) patients, disease onset occurred after the age of 65 years."
1787,191,"At the time of diagnosis, 15 (71.4%) of these patients reported symptoms of dry mouth and 16 (76.1%) of dry eye."
1788,191,"The most common extraglandular manifestation were arthralgias in 14 (66.7%), Raynaud's phenomenon in five (23.8%) and purpura in three (14.2%) cases."
1789,191,Ocular diagnostic tests (Schirmer's I and Rose-Bengal staining) were positive respectively in 17 (80%) and nine (44.4%) patients.
1790,191,"In eight (38%) cases, unstimulated whole salivary flow showed normal values, while 12 patients (57.1%) showed positivity for salivary sialography."
1791,191,A focus score greater or equal to 1 per 4mm(2) was demonstrated in 11 (53.3%) of the 21 cases.
1792,191,"CONCLUSION: Elderly onset of pSS was associated with similar incidence of the diagnostic tests positivity (parotid sialography, ocular tests, minor salivary gland biopsy) in comparison with adult and younger onset."
1793,191,"Moreover, no statistical differences were found among the three groups concerning sex, disease duration, as well as ocular and oral symptoms."
1794,192,Objective: The disease course in primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS) differs in different subsets of patients.
1795,192,The aim of this study was to clarify whether the pattern of organ involvement may improve the prediction of the very long-term disease outcome.
1796,192,Methods: We collected the data of 255 patients.
1797,192,"The total European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) score was compared with the pattern of organ involvement, as differentiated by the single ESSDAI domains: (i) at disease diagnosis, and (ii) in the follow-up, by verifying the appearance of new ESSDAI domains and/or the worsening of already active ESSDAI domains."
1798,192,Results: The mean follow-up duration was 9.1  6.9 years.
1799,192,"At disease diagnosis, only the articular activity at baseline could predict the long-term outcome of pSS detected at last follow-up visit, being protective in terms of stable or improved disease activity, as measured by ESSDAI [OR 2.9 (1.6-5.4), p = 0.01]."
1800,192,"In the follow-up, the onset, and/or worsening of either the peripheral nervous system (PNS) domain (by multivariate and univariate analysis), or the biological domain (only by univariate analysis) correlated with a higher disease activity at the last visit [PNS domain: OR 5.9 (2.4-14.5), p < 0.0001; biological domain: OR 1.9 (1.0-3.8), p = 0.043]."
1801,192,"A significantly higher number of patients with articular involvement were taking hydroxychloroquine at the last follow-up visits, if compared with patients without (41/130, 31.5 vs. 13/125, 10.4%, p < 0.0001)."
1802,192,"Conclusion: Single organ disease manifestations of SS, herein identified as the articular, PNS and biologic involvement, are relevant to predict the very long-term outcome in pSS."
1803,193,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the responsiveness of the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) and EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) treated with rituximab.
1804,193,METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with pSS treated with rituximab (1000 mg) infusions on days 1 and 15 were included in the study.
1805,193,"Data were collected prospectively at baseline and 16, 24, 36, 48 and 60 weeks after treatment."
1806,193,Internal responsiveness was assessed using standardised response means (SRM) and effect sizes (ES).
1807,193,"SRM and ES <0.5, 0.5-0.8 and >0.8 were interpreted as small, moderate and large, respectively."
1808,193,External responsiveness was assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients.
1809,193,"RESULTS: Median (range) ESSPRI and ESSDAI scores at baseline were 6.7 (0.3-9.0) and 8 (2-18), respectively."
1810,193,Both indices improved significantly after treatment.
1811,193,"SRM and ES values for ESSPRI and ESSDAI were 0.8 at week 16 and decreased afterwards, and were larger for ESSDAI than for ESSPRI."
1812,193,SRM and ES values for patient's and physician's global disease activity (GDA) and rheumatoid factor broadly followed the pattern of those of ESSPRI and ESSDAI.
1813,193,SRM and ES for stimulated whole salivary flow were small at all time points.
1814,193,"At baseline and for most change scores, moderate to good correlations were found between ESSPRI and patient's GDA and between ESSDAI and physician's GDA."
1815,193,Poor association was found between ESSPRI and ESSDAI.
1816,193,"CONCLUSIONS: ESSPRI and ESSDAI are sensitive measures of change in disease activity after therapeutic intervention, which supports the usefulness of these indices for future clinical trials in patients with pSS."
1817,193,The responsiveness of ESSDAI was greater than that of ESSPRI.
1818,194,BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is one of the autoimmune diseases with high incidence.
1819,194,There were several clinical investigations in Caucasian but seldom in Chinese.
1820,194,"The aim of this study was to compare the difference of clinical manifestations, immunological features and prognosis of pSS between Caucasian and Chinese pSS patients."
1821,194,METHODS: Five hundred and seventy-three patients who fulfilled the 2002 international classification (criteria) for pSS from Peking Union Medical College Hospital between 1985 and 2006 were screened retrospectively and compared with other populations.
1822,194,RESULTS: (1) The study consisted of 524 (91%) female and 49 (9%) male patients (female: male = 10.7:1).
1823,194,Mean age at the onset of the disease was (39.0  13.7) years and in 169 (29.5%) patients the disease onset occurred before the age of 30 years.
1824,194,"The average duration from disease onset to pSS diagnosis was 48 months (range, 1 - 552 months)."
1825,194,It had been shortened during the recent five years.
1826,194,"(2) Dry mouth (84.5%) and dry eyes (70.0%) were the most common symptoms, significantly lower than foreign patients (P = 0.000)."
1827,194,"Two hundred and seventy-two (47.5%) patients presented with rampant caries, 160 (27.9%) with parotidomegaly."
1828,194,"The positivity of xerostomia, xerophthalmia and salivary gland biopsy were 91.9%, 94.8% and 90.7%, respectively."
1829,194,(3) Systemic involvement occurred in 91.4% patients.
1830,194,"Compared with studies done outside China, higher prevalence of fever 41.0%, myositis 4.9%, pericardial effusion 14.8%, pulmonary involvement 42.3%, renal involvement 33.5%, thyroid involvement 32.7%, pancrease involvement 5.6% (P < 0.01) and lower prevalence of fatigue, lymphadenectasis and Raynaud's phenomenon (P < 0.01) were seen."
1831,194,"(4) Risk factors of death include pulmonary artery hypertension, liver damage and interstitial lung disease."
1832,194,"CONCLUSIONS: Chinese pSS differs significantly from the non-Chinese cases in terms of the age of onset, systemic involvement, autoantibodies and proportional mortality rate."
1833,194,Lung and liver damage were found to be the highest risk factors of the disease prognosis.
1834,195,Sjgren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the tear and salivary glands leading to dryness of the mouth and eyes.
1835,195,"The awareness that extraglandular manifestations, such as polyneuropathy, arthritis or recurrent airway infections may indicate Sjgren's syndrome is important."
1836,195,"In the diagnostic procedure, the tear and saliva production and antibodies against Sjgren's syndrome A (SS-A) and SS-B should be measured."
1837,195,A salivary gland biopsy should be performed when the diagnosis is not still clear.
1838,195,The therapy of oral and ocular dryness is mainly symptomatic whereas the treatment of extraglandular manifestations is based on experience with treatment of these manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
1839,196,My long scientific journey studying as a disease model Sjogren's syndrome (SS) gave me the opportunity to uncover the mysteries of systemic autoimmune diseases.
1840,196,"After an extensive training, under the supervision of the major autoimmune disease investigators, I was able to convey and expand the acquired knowledge through inspiring my students and collaborators."
1841,196,"Our research enriches the understanding of the wide clinical spectrum of the syndrome and the clinical, laboratory and molecular events predicting or being responsible for lymphomagenesis."
1842,196,"Our molecular and cellular studies indicated that the target of autoimmunity in SS, the activated glandular epithelial cells, play significant role in the initiation and perpetuation of the autoimmune process."
1843,196,"Furthermore, discovery of the epitopes on autoantigens where the autoimmune humoral reactivity is directed against, provided us tools to develop specific and sensitive diagnostic assays, to unmask similarities of the epitope sequence with infectious agents and gave us the potential to use them as therapeutic modalities."
1844,197,Sjgren's syndrome is a common autoimmune disorder characterized by dry mouth and dry eyes.
1845,197,Symptoms and signs are chronic and can be severe.
1846,197,The diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome can be confusing and time-consuming.
1847,197,The management can also be a significant challenge for the clinicians.
1848,197,"However, recent genomic and proteomic developments are unlocking the mystery of the disease process as well as contributing to our ability to define, diagnose, and develop new treatment modalities for patients with this complex disorder."
1849,198,"Sjgren's syndrome, a chronic and progressive autoimmune disorder mainly characterized by xerophthalmia, xerostomia, and parotid enlargement, is primarily managed medically, but some patients will require surgical management."
1850,198,Patients with Sjgren's syndrome have an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
1851,198,Superficial parotidectomy is indicated for diagnostic purposes and can be therapeutic in limited circumstances.
1852,198,"Surgical indications for parotidectomy in Sjgren's syndrome include recurrent parotitis refractory to medical management; salivary gland malignancy; and severe, refractory pain."
1853,198,"Surgical complications include transient or permanent facial nerve injury, post-operative pain, persistent inflammation of remnant parotid tissue, Frey syndrome, and facial scarring."
1854,199,Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by dryness of the mouth and the eyes.
1855,199,"Systemic involvement in SS is well known, however, obvious cardiac manifestations, particularly significant valve disorders, are extremely rare and only three cases of significant valve disease associated with SS that required surgical intervention have been previously described."
1856,199,We report a case of aortic stenosis (AS) associated with SS in an elderly patient.
1857,199,"The diagnosis of primary SS had been made based on clinical features, positive ocular signs, and positive serologic findings."
1858,199,"Echocardiography showed severe calcification, elevated mean pressure gradient (57 mmHg), and a small orifice area (0.45 cm(2)) of the aortic valve."
1859,199,"At surgery, severe calcification of the aortic cusps and the annulus was the mechanism of AS, and the aortic valve was replaced with a bioprosthetic valve."
1860,199,"Valve pathology showed nodular calcification and hyaline degeneration, but lymphocyte infiltration was not evident."
1861,199,"The etiologic relation of SS to the valve lesions is not clear pathologically in this case, however, chronic inflammation related to immunologic reactions in SS could have some effect on exacerbation for degeneration of the valve tissue."
1862,200,"Sjgren's syndrome is a rare disorder of the immune system characterized by the chronic lymphocytic infiltration of the organs with exocrine secretion (lachrymal, salivary glands), but also of other tissues of the body, that can be primary or secondary and can appear alone or in association with other systemic diseases: rheumatic arthritis, systemic erythematous lupus, scleroderma or polymyositisdermatomyositis."
1863,200,"The case that we are presenting is that of a 40-year-old man, who came to the Department of Rheumatology with articular, muscular, ocular, psychological and neurological symptoms."
1864,200,"After multiple biological, immunological, histological, neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological, digestive investigations, it was reached the conclusion that the patient presents a rare autoimmune disease (primary Sjgren's syndrome) involving mainly peripheral neuromuscular and psychological (small frequency) and the patient was given specific immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-depressive treatment, to which he responded well."
1865,200,"Thus, after 18 months of investigation, severe depressive episodes and difficult collaboration of the patient with the medical team, it was possible to reach the definitive diagnosis and to perform the appropriate treatment."
1866,201,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a complex heterogeneous disease charactered by a broad spectrum of clinical and serological manifestations, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)."
1867,201,"Last year, 2015, was an exciting year for research into SS with novel insights into disease pathogenesis, clinical aspects and long-term outcomes."
1868,201,"In addition, the use of biologic therapy in SS is rapidly expanding, with new evidence emerging regarding potential therapeutic targets."
1869,201,"In this article, we will provide an overview of the recent literature on the pathogenesis, clinical features and novel treatments of SS."
1870,202,OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and the predictors of silent but substantial liver fibrosis in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS).
1871,202,"METHODS: We enrolled 101 pSS patients with normal liver function and structures, and without significant liver diseases or other conditions affecting liver fibrosis."
1872,202,The European league against rheumatism (EULAR) SS patients reported index (ESSPRI) and the EULAR SS disease activity index (ESSDAI) were analyzed.
1873,202,Liver stiffness (LS) was measured using transient elastography and 7.4 kPa was determined as the cutoff value for significant liver fibrosis.
1874,202,RESULTS: The median age of patients (91women) was 53 years and the median LS value was 4.7 kPa.
1875,202,The median ESSPRI and ESSDAI showed no correlation with LS values.
1876,202,Twelve patients (11.9%) had significant liver fibrosis.
1877,202,"In multivariate logistic regression, white blood cells count 4000.0/mm(3) (Odds ratio [OR] 9.821), serum albumin3.8mg/dL (OR 16.770) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 27.0 IU/L (OR 20.858) independently predicted silent but substantial liver fibrosis in pSS patients."
1878,202,"CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of silent but substantial liver fibrosis was 11.9% in pSS and its predictors were leukopenia, decreased serum albumin and increased AST levels."
1879,203,PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate meibomian gland dropout and lipid layer thickness (LLT) in patients with and without Sjgren's syndrome dry eye (SS).
1880,203,"METHODS: We recruited 11 participants with SS (males/females [M/F], 1:10; mean age = 56.0  9.1 years) and 10 control subjects without dry eye (M/F, 3:7; mean age = 58.5  4.7 years)."
1881,203,All participants completed the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire.
1882,203,The LLT was assessed using the Tearscope Plus based on the appearance of the lipid layer.
1883,203,Noninvasive tear break-up time (NITBUT) also was measured.
1884,203,"The lower and upper lids were everted, and the meibomian glands were imaged using the infrared camera of the Keratograph 4."
1885,203,A meibomian gland dropout score due to gland loss was obtained.
1886,203,Statistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test and correlations were determined using Spearman rank correlations.
1887,203,"RESULTS: Of the SS participants, 100% reported ocular and oral dryness symptoms in the AECC questionnaire."
1888,203,"The SS group recorded a higher OSDI score (median = 48.00, interquartile range [IQR] 23.0-56.2 vs. 2.1, IQR 0.0-2.6; P < 0.001), reduced LLT (median [IQR] = 15.0 [15.0-15.0] vs. 60.0 [45.0-100.0] nm; P = 0.001), and lower NITBUT (median [IQR] = 3.7 [2.5-4.2] vs. 9.5 [6.4-17.6] sec; P < 0.001) compared to the controls."
1889,203,Digital meibomian gland dropout score (% dropout) was significantly higher for the SS group (16.0% [IQR 12.1-40.0%] vs. 6.7% [IQR 1.5-12.7%]; P = 0.01).
1890,203,Subjective meibomian gland dropout score (0-6 score) was significantly higher for the SS group (median [IQR] = 1.5 [1.0-4.0] vs. 1.0 [0.0-1.25]; P = 0.03).
1891,203,"CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SS showed higher meibomian gland dropout scores and reduced LLT and NITBUT, which likely contribute to the severe dry eye symptoms reported by SS subjects."
1892,204,OBJECTIVES: Articular manifestations (AMs) occurred in approximately 30-60% of patients with primary SS (pSS).
1893,204,"We conducted the current study to describe clinical presentation, specific treatment and to report clinical outcome of pSS patients with AM in a large bicentric French cohort."
1894,204,"METHODS: Clinical, biological and immunological features of 419 consecutive patients with pSS were recorded in order to describe the clinical and immunological course of pSS AM and to point out the impact of those rheumatological features on pSS evolution."
1895,204,"RESULTS: A total of 188 patients with pSS (172 women, 16 men) exhibited AM."
1896,204,"They preceded sicca symptoms in 32, were simultaneous to pSS diagnosis in 98 and followed diagnosis in 59 patients."
1897,204,"Clinical presentation was polyarticular and concerned mostly peripheral joints (synovitis, n = 66)."
1898,204,Symptoms responded readily to symptomatic treatment in 45 cases (24%).
1899,204,"DMARDs or immunosuppressive treatments were introduced in 133 patients: HCQ (n = 111), corticosteroid (n = 53), MTX (n = 12), SSZ (n = 6), AZA (n = 3), LEF (n = 1), etanercept (n = 1) and allochrysine (n = 1)."
1900,204,Only one case of RA was diagnosed during the evolution.
1901,204,"Statistical analysis identified clinical and biological factors associated with AM (P < or = 0.05): RP, muscular manifestations, renal involvement, peripheral neuropathy, cutaneous vasculitis, and positivity of RF, anti-SSB antibodies and cryoglobulinaemia."
1902,204,Patients with AM at diagnosis were characterized by a multisystemic involvement at the end of the follow-up period (P < 0.001).
1903,204,"CONCLUSION: Although AMs are frequent and usually mild in pSS, these manifestations are associated with a pluri-systemic involvement of pSS."
1904,205,OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventional sialendoscopy alone or combined with outpatient intraductal steroid irrigations in patients with sialadenitis due to Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
1905,205,DESIGN: A pilot therapeutic study.
1906,205,"SETTING: ENT Clinics, Universities of Milan and Pavia."
1907,205,"STUDY POPULATION: We included 22 patients with SS of whom 12 underwent interventional sialendoscopy followed by intraductal steroid irrigations (group A), and 10 interventional sialendoscopy alone (group B)."
1908,205,"OUTCOMES MEASURES: The following outcome measures were considered and recorded before and after the therapeutic intervention: (i) number of episodes of glandular swelling, (ii) cumulative prevalence of patients with glandular swelling assessed by the specific domain, the EULAR SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), (iii) severity of pain by means of a 0-10 pain visual analogue scale (VAS), (iv) severity of xerostomia and other disease symptoms assessed by the EULAR SS Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) and the Xerostomia Inventory questionnaire."
1909,205,"RESULTS: The postoperative reduction in the mean number of episodes of glandular swelling was 87% (95% CI: 77-93) and 75% (95% CI: 47%-88%) in the groups A and B, respectively."
1910,205,"The percentage of patients with glandular swelling decreased from 41.7% to 0.0% in the group A and from 30.0% to 0.0% in the group B, respectively."
1911,205,"Most of the patients experienced a subjective clinical improvement documented by the statistically significant reductions in the postoperative mean pain VAS (group A P<.001; group B P=.004), Xerostomia Inventory (P<.001 and P=.003) and ESSPRI scores (P<.001 and P=.008)."
1912,205,"Interventional sialendoscopy followed by outpatient intraductal steroid irrigations was more effective than interventional sialendoscopy alone, when pain VAS, Xerostomia Inventory and ESSPRI scores before and after treatment were analysed together using the multivariate Hotelling T(2) test (P=.0173)."
1913,205,CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study confirms that interventional sialendoscopy with steroid duct irrigation significantly reduces the number of painful episodes of sialadenitis and improves the subjective sensation of oral dryness and other disease symptoms in patients with SS.
1914,205,The study results also suggest that the improvement is greater when interventional sialendoscopy is combined with a cycle of outpatient steroid ductal irrigations.
1915,205,Larger controlled randomised studies are certainly needed to confirm these preliminary data.
1916,206,Hypokalaemic rhabdomyolysis represents a medical emergency requiring rapid diagnosis and appropriate aetiological treatment.
1917,206,Renal tubular acidosis is a common cause of hypokalemia which can be idiopathic or secondary to systemic disorders such as Sjogren's syndrome.
1918,206,"It can remain asymptomatic or manifest with metabolic abnormalities including hypokalemia paralysis, hypocalcaemia and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis."
1919,206,Rhabdomyolysis presenting with severe hypokalemia as the first manifestation of Sjogren's syndrome is rare.
1920,206,We report a case of a 59-year-old woman who presented to our department with severe weakness of all limbs.
1921,206,Laboratory examination demonstrated hypokalemic rhabdomyolysis caused by distal renal tubular acidosis.
1922,206,Investigations revealed Sjogren's syndrome as the underlying cause of the metabolic disorders.
1923,207,Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease that commonly presents to the ophthalmologist as a dry eye disease.
1924,207,We report an unusual presentation of a case of Sjogren's syndrome.
1925,207,"A 33-year-old man presented with lid swelling, pseudomembraneous conjunctivitis with central corneal epithelial defect and history of limb weakness for past 2 years."
1926,207,There was progressive enlargement of the epithelial defect and conjunctival-scleral necrosis developed during follow-up.
1927,207,"Evaluation for underlying connective tissue disorder was positive for SS-B/La antibody and, the rheumatoid factor, anti nuclear antibody, anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titres were negative."
1928,207,Patient was diagnosed as a case of Primary Sjogren's syndrome.
1929,207,Resolution of the conjunctival-scleral necrosis occurred following treatment with combination of cyclosporine and prednisolone.
1930,207,Paramedian tarsorrhaphy was performed to promote healing of the corneal epithelium.
1931,207,"The corneal epithelium healed, conjunctival-scleral necrosis resolved completely and the visual acuity improved to 6/36 in the right eye after 3 months of immunosuppressive therapy."
1932,207,The immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued after completion of 6 months of treatment.
1933,207,"After 6 months follow-up of stopping immunosuppressive therapy, the ocular and systemic condition is stable."
1934,208,PURPOSE: Primary Sjgren's syndrome is a multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by hypofunction of salivary and lacrimal glands and possible multi-organ system manifestations.
1935,208,"Over the past 15 years, three sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed, but none has included salivary gland ultrasonography."
1936,208,"However, recent studies support its role in the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of patients with Sjgren's syndrome."
1937,208,This study aimed to determine the value of salivary gland ultrasonography in the diagnosis and prognosis of Sjgren's syndrome by relating ultrasonography severity scores to clinical and laboratory data.
1938,208,METHODS: Seventy patients who fulfilled the 2002 American-European Consensus Group diagnostic criteria for primary Sjgren's syndrome were selected from 84 patients receiving care in specialized outpatient clinics at our institution from November 2013 to May 2016.
1939,208,"Their serology, European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI), salivary flow rate, immunoglobulin G, and salivary and serum beta-2 microglobulin levels were measured."
1940,208,"Salivary gland ultrasonography was performed by an experienced radiologist, using scores of 1-4 to classify salivary gland impairment."
1941,208,RESULTS: Salivary gland ultrasonography scores of 1 or 2 were associated with an ESSDAI < 5.
1942,208,"Ultrasonography scores of 3 or 4 were associated with an ESSDAI 5 (p = 0.064), a positive antinuclear antibody test (p = 0.006), positive anti-Ro/SSA antibodies (p = 0.003), positive anti-La/SSB antibodies (p = 0.077), positive rheumatoid factor (p = 0.034), and immunoglobulin G levels > 1600 mg/dL (p = 0.077)."
1943,208,Salivary flow rate was lower in patients with scores 3 or 4 (p = 0.001).
1944,208,CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence that salivary gland ultrasonography can be used not only for diagnosis but also for prognostic evaluation of primary Sjgren's syndrome.
1945,208,These findings confirm what has been reported in the literature.
1946,208,"However, further analyses involving larger matched samples are required to support this finding and include salivary gland ultrasonography as part of the diagnostic criteria for Sjgren's syndrome."
1947,209,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of sicca symptoms, dry eye, and secondary Sjgren's syndrome and to evaluate the severity of dry eye in patients with mixed connective tissue disease."
1948,209,"METHODS: In total, 44 consecutive patients with mixed connective tissue disease (Kasukawa's criteria) and 41 healthy controls underwent Schirmer's test, a tear film breakup time test, and ocular surface staining to investigate dry eye."
1949,209,"In addition, the dry eye severity was graded."
1950,209,Ocular and oral symptoms were assessed using a structured questionnaire.
1951,209,Salivary gland scintigraphy was performed in all patients.
1952,209,Classification of secondary Sjgren's syndrome was assessed according to the American-European Consensus Group criteria.
1953,209,RESULTS: The patients and controls had comparable ages (44.712.4 vs. 47.212.2 years) and frequencies of female gender (93 vs. 95%) and Caucasian ethnicity (71.4 vs. 85%).
1954,209,Ocular symptoms (47.7 vs. 24.4%) and oral symptoms (52.3 vs. 9.7%) were significantly more frequent in patients than in controls.
1955,209,"Fourteen (31.8%) patients fulfilled Sjgren's syndrome criteria, seven of whom (50%) did not have this diagnosis prior to study inclusion."
1956,209,A further comparison of patients with mixed connective tissue disease with or without Sjgren's syndrome revealed that the former presented significantly lower frequencies of polyarthritis and cutaneous involvement than did the patients without Sjgren's syndrome.
1957,209,Moderate to severe dry eye was found in 13 of 14 patients with mixed connective tissue disease and Sjgren's syndrome (92.8%).
1958,209,"CONCLUSIONS: Sjgren's syndrome, particularly with moderate to severe dry eye, is frequent in patients with mixed connective tissue disease."
1959,209,These findings alert the physician regarding the importance of the appropriate diagnosis of this syndrome in such patients.
1960,210,Sjgren syndrome (SS) comprises glandular and extraglandular manifestations.
1961,210,"Double-blind prospective trials of traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics have failed because they have not improved benign symptoms, the major cause of lowered quality of life."
1962,210,"Rituximab has proven effective in SS patients with associated mixed cryoglobulinemia, parotid gland swelling, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, thrombocytopenia, and other manifestations."
1963,210,There were few of these SS patients in the trials required for FDA approval.
1964,210,"Most patients had benign symptoms and did not show benefit, leading to failure of the study."
1965,210,This article examines the reasons for these failures and proposes future directions.
1966,211,A young lady with a history of repeated episodes of generalised weakness and fatigue presented to our hospital with similar symptoms and was found to have severe hypokalaemia.
1967,211,"She had been previously diagnosed as hypokalaemic periodic paralysis but during this presentation she had also started complaining of the classic sicca-complex of Sjogren's syndrome, which was not present previously."
1968,211,On subsequent investigations she was found to have normal anion-gap metabolic acidosis with positive urine anion gap consistent with the diagnosis of distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA).
1969,211,It was thus concluded that the distal RTA secondary to Sjogren's syndrome was the cause of severe hypokalaemia in our patient.
1970,211,By presenting this case we aim to not only highlight one of the rare presentations of Sjogren's syndrome but also the favourable response of our patient to potassium replacement alone.
1971,212,OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the utility of salivary gland ultrasound (SGUS) in the diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) singly or integrated with 2016 ACR/EULAR classification criteria.
1972,212,METHODS: Patients with suspected pSS were enrolled in the study.
1973,212,SGUS semi-quantitative scoring was used to assess salivary gland.
1974,212,"Clinical characteristics were recorded, including autoantibodies, ophthalmic tests, salivary glands scintigraphy (SGS) and labial biopsy."
1975,212,The diagnostic accuracy of SGUS score and complementary value of SGUS to 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria were analysed.
1976,212,RESULTS: 282 patients were included for analysis.
1977,212,161 were diagnosed as pSS and 121 as non-SS.
1978,212,SGUS score5 showed 64.7% sensitivity and 81.4% specificity for the diagnosis of pSS.
1979,212,"Positive anti-SSA, abnormal SGS and SGUS score were significantly higher in pSS than non-SS group (80.1% vs. 14.0%, p<0.01; 91.3% vs. 57.0%, p<0.01; 8.46.6 vs. 2.63.2, p<0.01 respectively)."
1980,212,A weighted score [(anti-SSA16.5) + (SGS14.5) + (SGUS4.5)] was constructed.
1981,212,"The score 17.5 could improve the sensitivity, and almost keep the specificity comparing to 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria (89.9% vs. 85.6% and 79.5% vs. 82.2%)."
1982,212,"When replacing labial biopsy by SGUS in 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria, both sensitivity and specificity were a bit decreased (85.0% vs. 85.6% and 79.8% vs. 82.2%)."
1983,212,"When adding SGUS to 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria, it showed better performance by improving the sensitivity (90.8% vs. 85.6%), while not losing the specificity (83.7% vs. 82.2%)."
1984,212,CONCLUSIONS: Adding SGUS score to the 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria can improve the diagnosis utility of pSS.
1985,212,SGUS may be a feasible and prospective tool in the diagnosis of pSS.
1986,213,Renal involvement in primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) varies in severity and prevalence.
1987,213,"Although previously felt to be uncommon, kidneys can be involved in 25% to 30% of pSS patients."
1988,213,Fibrillary glomerulonephritis (FGN) is a rare primary glomerular disease that can occur in association with another autoimmune condition or malignancy.
1989,213,The diagnosis relies on renal biopsy findings of haphazardly arranged fibrils in all glomerular compartments and distinction from other forms of fibrillary glomerulopathies such as renal amyloidosis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy.
1990,213,FGN responds poorly to immunosuppressive therapy and has a poor prognosis.
1991,213,"Here, we describe a case of FGN in a patient with asymptomatic pSS."
1992,213,"We describe the diagnostic work-up, clinical course, treatment utilized, and 1-year follow-up."
1993,213,There is one other case in the literature of FGN in a patient with pSS.
1994,213,The rarity of this association and distinction of FGN from other forms of renal involvement in pSS is important as it impacts therapy and prognosis.
1995,213,The case highlights electron microscopy findings in FGN and poor prognosis.
1996,214,BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) represents the most common rheumatologic disease in the head and neck area.
1997,214,"Due to various nonspecific symptoms, many different medical specialities are involved in diagnostic and therapeutic regimes of patients with pSS."
1998,214,Therefore broad knowledge of symptoms and therapeutic options is important.
1999,214,"Effective management of xerostomia, keratoconjunctivis sicca (KCS), and rhinitis sicca (RS) is essential in every patient to alleviate symptoms and prevent local complications."
2000,214,"Various substitutes with different ingredients are available for topical and symptomatic therapy, but there are no generally accepted treatment suggestions due to the lack of studies proving effective relief of symptoms."
2001,214,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between October 2007 and August 2012, pSS was diagnosed in 73patients according to the American European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria."
2002,214,"Before and after a 2-month period of treatment with liposomal agents for oral, nasal, and ocular complaints (LipoSaliva, LipoNasal, and Tears Again,) AECG criteria and subjective symptoms were evaluated using visual analogue scales."
2003,214,"RESULTS: Xerostomia (92%), KCS (92%), and recurrent salivary gland swelling (40%) were the leading clinical symptoms."
2004,214,"Mean salivary flow rate was 1.89g (Saxon test), mean lacrimal flow 12.7mm (SchirmerI test)."
2005,214,SS-A and -B antibodies could be detected in 47patients (29%).
2006,214,An average histologic focus score of 3 was assigned (Chisholm and Mason).
2007,214,"Extraglandular manifestations were observed in 17%, while severe local complications due to ineffective treatment of sicca symptoms were diagnosed in 70.5%."
2008,214,"Liposomal local therapy caused a significant reduction of xerostomia (p=0.0001), KCS (p=0.004), and RS (p=0.004)."
2009,214,"CONCLUSION: Local therapy with liposomal agents is effective in the symptomatic treatment of xerostomia, KCS, and RS in patients with pSS."
2010,215,BACKGROUND: Parotid glands diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in Sjgren's syndrome patients have provided conflicting results currently.
2011,215,PURPOSE: To determine if parotid gland DWI using a small region of interest (ROI) can provide diagnosis and assess therapeutic efficacy in Sjgren's syndrome.
2012,215,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three women with Sjgren's syndrome, five with dry mouth who did not meet diagnostic criteria for Sjgren's syndrome, and 11 healthy volunteers (controls) were evaluated with DWI."
2013,215,"All participants received routine T1-weighted (T1W) imaging and T2-weighted (T2W) fat-suppressed imaging, and DWI."
2014,215,The SI ratios (SIRs) and ADC ratios (ADCRs) for parotid gland/spinal cord were then calculated.
2015,215,"Approximately 8-10 round ROIs measuring approximately 5mm(2) were placed on each lobe of the parotid gland, and the signal intensity (SI) was measured while avoiding fat, ducts, and blood vessels."
2016,215,A ROI encompassing the entire lobe of the parotid gland was also used to measure SI.
2017,215,"RESULTS: Using 5mm(2) ROIs significantly higher DWI SIRs were noted in participants with Sjgren's syndrome compared with either participants with dry mouth without Sjgren's syndrome or healthy volunteers (all, P <0.001)."
2018,215,The difference was not related to the presence of fat.
2019,215,No differences were noted when the larger ROI was used.
2020,215,"In addition, parotid gland from untreated Sjgren's participants showed significantly higher SIRs compared with those from treated participants (P=0.015)."
2021,215,"CONCLUSION: A small ROI DWI can provide morphological and functional information on the parotid gland in Sjgren's syndrome patients, and can aid in the diagnosis and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy."
2022,216,OBJECTIVES: To analyse the prevalence and clinical significance of bronchiectasis in a large series of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and evaluate its impact on disease expression and outcomes.
2023,216,METHODS: The study cohort included 507 patients with primary SS.
2024,216,Bronchiectasis were diagnosed according to pulmonary computed tomography (CT).
2025,216,"As a control group, we included 37 consecutive SS patients evaluated by pulmonary CT during the same study period without pulmonary involvement."
2026,216,"RESULTS: Fifty primary SS patients had bronchiectasis according to the pulmonary CT. Nine patients were excluded due to non-autoimmune processes and 41 were classified as bronchiectasis associated with primary SS (40 women, mean age of 64 years)."
2027,216,All cases of bronchiectasis were of the cylindrical type and were located in the inferior lobes in 29 cases (71%).
2028,216,"Patients with bronchiectasis were older at diagnosis of SS (60.39 vs. 52.54 years, p=0.022) and had a higher frequency of hiatus hernia (41% vs. 16%, p=0.024) in comparison with controls."
2029,216,"Immunologically, patients with bronchiectasis had a lower frequency of anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies (27% vs. 54%, p=0.022) but a higher frequency of anti-smooth muscle--SMAantibodies (82% vs. 60%, p=0.043)."
2030,216,"During follow-up, patients with bronchiectasis had a higher frequency of respiratory infections (56% vs. 3%, p<0.001) and pneumonia (29% vs. 3%, p=0.002) in comparison with those without."
2031,216,"CONCLUSIONS: Patients with primary SS and bronchiectasis are characterised by an older age, a high frequency of hiatus hernia, a specific immunologic pattern (low frequency of anti-Ro/SS-A and high frequency of anti-SMA) and during follow-up a much higher frequency of respiratory infections and pneumonia."
2032,217,OBJECTIVE: To determine the subcellular localization of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in labial salivary gland (LSG) and evaluate the diagnostic use of the extracellular domain of EpCAM (EpEX) and intracellular domain (EpICD) for primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
2033,217,METHODS: Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was conducted using EpEX and EpICD domain-specific antibodies on labial salivary gland biopsy (LSGB) from participants.
2034,217,"Chi-square or Fisher's exact analysis, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Kruskal-Wallis test compared differences among groups."
2035,217,Independent risk factors of pSS were determined by multiple logistic regression analysis.
2036,217,Receiver-operator characteristic curves (ROC) were carried out to estimate the diagnostic value.
2037,217,"RESULTS: Compared to non-SS controls, loss of membranous EpEX and EpICD expression was observed in LSGB of pSS patients, which occurred in parallel with increased accumulation of cytoplastic and nuclear EpICD."
2038,217,"The subcellular EpEX/EpICD expressions were associated with various features of pSS patients, especially histopathological grade of LSGB."
2039,217,"Furthermore, high IHC scores of membranous EpEX were independent risk factors for pSS, even for the pSS patients at early stage."
2040,217,The IHC scores of subcellular EpEX/EpICD were of great diagnostic value for pSS with high sensitivity (70-80%) and specificity (85-95%).
2041,217,CONCLUSION: This study first found the aberrant expression pattern of EpCAM in LSG of pSS patients.
2042,217,The IHC scores of subcellular EpEX/EpICD were demonstrated to have the potential to act as diagnostic biomarkers for pSS.
2043,218,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a complex heterogeneous autoimmune disorder, typically affecting exocrine glands."
2044,218,"Recently, a great interest has arisen in searching for novel biomarkers able to improve the diagnostic work-up of the disease as well as the general assessment and the prognostic stratification of pSS patients."
2045,218,"From this perspective, salivary proteomics has appeared as a promising tool considering that salivary proteins may closely reflect the underlying disease processes in the salivary glands."
2046,218,"Areas covered: Here we will provide an update on the state of the art of proteomics in pSS, focusing in particular on putative novel biomarkers for the disease."
2047,218,There is a special focus on candidate salivary protein and their role in non-invasive diagnosis of pSS.
2048,218,Expert commentary: Proteomics represents an emerging throughput omics-based approach for use in diagnosis of pSS.
2049,218,"The studies that have been presented in this review have provided major contributions towards the identification of putative protein biomarkers, that once validated, could be able not only to contribute to a non-invasive diagnosis of pSS but also to the stratification of different disease subsets, ultimately allowing a better comprehension of the disease."
2050,219,"Dysphagia is a common complaint of patients with Sjogren's syndrome, but its mechanism remains a subject of controversy."
2051,219,The association of Sjogren's syndrome with Plummer-Vinson syndrome remains uncommon.
2052,219,We report a 56-year-old women who presented both disorders.
2053,219,"The diagnosis of the Plummer-Vinson syndrome was based on the classic triad of dysphagia, iron-deficiency anaemia and oesophageal webs."
2054,219,The diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome was based on the presence of three Fox criteria.
2055,219,This association should incite us to search for common immuno-genetic pathogenic factors between these two syndromes.
2056,220,"Notwithstanding that psychological distress and illness perceptions are important in determining outcomes in rheumatic diseases, few studies investigated these variables in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
2057,220,"We aimed to compare illness perceptions and psychological distress in patients with pSS, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to test whether their associations with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are similar in these groups of patients."
2058,220,"In 57 patients with pSS, 75 with SLE and 199 with RA, we administered the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Symptom Check-List and the Brief-Illness Perception Questionnaire to assess psychological variables and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument, Short-Form to assess HRQoL."
2059,220,Hierarchical regression models determined the associations of psychological variables with HRQoL after adjusting for demographic variables and clinical parameters.
2060,220,"The prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms (PHQ-9  10) was 24.6 % in pSS, 29.3 % in SLE and 25.1 % in RA."
2061,220,Patients with pSS showed little understanding of their disease (comprehensibility) and attributed more symptoms to their illness (identity) compared with the other groups of patients.
2062,220,Illness perceptions and depressive symptoms were independently associated with physical HRQoL in a similar pattern in all three groups.
2063,220,"In pSS, however, the patients' worries about the consequences of their illness was a stronger correlate of physical HRQoL than pain."
2064,220,These findings indicate that psychological factors are important correlates of HRQoL in these disease groups and encourage the design of psycho-educational therapies targeting disease-related cognitions in pSS in an attempt to improve patient's physical HRQoL.
2065,221,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disease mainly characterised by the inflammation of exocrine glands; however, a broad spectrum of systemic manifestations may characterise the disease."
2066,221,"Recently, pSS has been the object of considerable immunologic and clinical research which has led to significant advances in the diagnosis, prognostic assessment and management of the disease."
2067,221,"Herewith, we provide a critical digest of the recent literature on this topic."
2068,222,Primary Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease wherein there is lymphocytic infiltration of salivary and lacrimal glands.
2069,222,This inflammation is thought to be caused by B-lymphocytes.
2070,222,"The most common clinical feature of Sjogren's is dryness of the mouth and eyes, but rare complications can occur such as autoimmune cytopenias."
2071,222,Here we report two cases of immune mediated cytopenias that were diagnosed to be due to Sjogren's syndrome.
2072,222,"In both cases, immune suppressive treatment was required."
2073,223,"RATIONALE: TAFRO syndrome is a newly proposed disorder that manifests as thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin myelofibrosis, renal dysfunction, and organomegaly."
2074,223,"In this report, we describe the development of severe TAFRO syndrome-like systemic symptoms during the clinical course of juvenile-onset Sjgren's syndrome in a 32-year-old woman."
2075,223,"PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was admitted due to dyspnea, fever, polyarthralgia, and generalized edema."
2076,223,"She had been diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome at the age of 14 years, based on histopathological examination of a biopsy of the minor salivary glands and the development of Raynaud's phenomenon, with no follow-up treatment required."
2077,223,"On admission, she presented with anemia, elevated C-reactive protein levels, anasarca, and hepato-splenomegaly."
2078,223,"A bone marrow examination revealed increased megakaryocytes with reticulin fibrosis, and the histopathology of an axillary lymph node was consistent with mixed-type Castleman disease."
2079,223,"Eventually, she developed thrombocytopenia."
2080,223,INTERVENTIONS: Her symptoms fulfilled all of the major and minor categories of the diagnostic criteria for TAFRO syndrome.
2081,223,"However, considering her prior diagnosis, we assumed that the clinical presentation was consistent with an acute exacerbation of Sjgren's syndrome."
2082,223,"Unlike typical cases of TAFRO syndrome, the administration of relatively low-dose prednisolone relieved her symptoms."
2083,223,"LESSONS: Differentiation between TAFRO syndrome and exacerbation of an autoimmune disease is clinically important, although this can be challenging."
2084,223,Identification of specific biomarkers for TAFRO syndrome would be clinically beneficial.
2085,224,OBJECTIVE: A new sonoelastography technique - virtual touch tissue quantification of acoustic radiation force impulses (ARFI) - offers a promising method for measuring tissue rigidity.
2086,224,The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of ARFI for diagnosing Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
2087,224,"METHODS: This transversal prospective study included 41 patients with SS according to American-European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria, and a control group without symptoms."
2088,224,All subjects underwent ARFI high-resolution ultrasound assessment of the parotid glands (PG) and submandibular glands (SMG).
2089,224,"RESULTS: In patients with SS, parotid gland shear wave velocity (SWV) was 2.08m/s0.55, significantly higher than in control subjects (1.2m/s0.17) (P=0.0001); submandibular gland SWV was higher in SS patients (2.12m/s0.44) than control subjects (1.56m/s0.16) (P=0.001)."
2090,224,"CONCLUSIONS: Acoustic radiation force impulses sonoelastography can assist diagnosis of SS, and is a non-invasive and fast method of detecting pathological changes to the parotid and submandibular glands."
2091,225,Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis (HPP) may occur as a rare complication of Sjogren Syndrome (SS) and Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA).
2092,225,"A 64-year male patient came with HPP, and was later diagnosed with distal RTA."
2093,225,"The patient, who had no xerostomia and xerophthalmia, was diagnosed with primary SS from serologic and histologic findings of minor salivary gland biopsy."
2094,225,The patient recovered after potassium replacement therapy.
2095,225,Renal biopsy was also performed and revealed evidence of tubulointerstitial nephritis.
2096,225,Corticosteroids were administered and there was no recurrence of HPP during a 4-year follow-up period.
2097,225,The case highlights the significance of acute hypokalemia management in emergency department as it can unmask SS even if the SS is not associated with sicca symptoms.
2098,225,Hypokalemic paralysis associated with normal anion gap metabolic acidosis should prompt toward the diagnosis of SS.
2099,226,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article critically reviews the current views and discusses the future challenges with regard to assessing disease progression and disease activity in Sjgren's syndrome, as a decrease of disease progression and activity is what an effective Sjgren's syndrome therapy aims for."
2100,226,"This topic has recently gained renewed attention as targeted treatment modalities have become available in primary Sjgren's syndrome, while the lack of well established outcome parameters interferes with a straightforward comparison of the outcomes of the various trials."
2101,226,"RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances in how to assess changes in disease progression and activity objectively (via repeated biopsies of salivary glands, sialometry, sialochemistry, biomarkers, secretion and composition of tears, EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index: ESSDAI) and subjectively (EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Related Index: ESSPRI) have opened new ways to reliably assess the outcome of a particular treatment."
2102,226,"SUMMARY: Newly applied tools are instrumental, both for clinical research and clinical practice, in reliably judging and comparing the value of well established and newly developed therapies in Sjgren's syndrome."
2103,227,OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether CCL21 and CXCL13 expression levels in the minor salivary gland are associated with the laboratory and clinical manifestations of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
2104,227,METHODS: Sociodemographic data on 106 SS patients were obtained and the glandular and extraglandular manifestations of the disease were documented.
2105,227,"In addition, minor salivary gland biopsies were performed and the patients' laboratory findings were analysed."
2106,227,European League Against Rheumatism SS disease activity index (ESSDAI) values of SS disease activity at the time of biopsy and the SS disease damage index (SSDDI) values were also recorded.
2107,227,An immunohistochemical approach was used to semiquantitatively measure the CCL21 and CXCL13 expression in the minor salivary glands.
2108,227,"RESULTS: The minor salivary glands of SS patients stained positively for CCL21 and CXCL13 in 46.2% (49/106) and 70.7% (75/106) of all cases, respectively."
2109,227,"Higher-level expression of CCL21 and CXCL13 was associated with increases in ESR, IgG and rheumatoid factor levels, as well as anti-SS-A and -SS-B titers."
2110,227,A higher focus score and ESSDAI value at the time of biopsy were also associated with these chemokines.
2111,227,"In patients with extraglandular manifestations of SS, the prevalence of lymphadenopathy increased with increasing CCL21 levels."
2112,227,CONCLUSIONS: The expression levels of CCL21 and CXCL13 within the lymphocytic infiltrates of SS patients were associated with several laboratory features of the disease as well as lymphadenopathy and the extent of clinical disease activity.
2113,227,CCL21 and CXCL13 levels can therefore serve as useful markers to predict the disease activity and prognosis of patients with SS.
2114,228,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the degree of involvement shown by parotid scintigraphy at diagnosis and the disease expression, outcomes, and prognosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
2115,228,METHODS: All patients consecutively diagnosed with primary SS in our department between 1984 and 2008 were evaluated.
2116,228,"The scintigraphic stages were classified into class 4 (severe involvement), class 2-3 (mild to moderate involvement), and class 1 (normal results)."
2117,228,"RESULTS: A total of 405 patients with primary SS underwent parotid scintigraphy at diagnosis (47 had class 1 involvement, 314 had class 2-3, and 44 had class 4)."
2118,228,"Patients with class 4 had a higher frequency of parotid enlargement (p < 0.001), systemic involvement (p = 0.007), high titers of antinuclear antibody (p = 0.016), positive rheumatoid factor (p = 0.002), anti-Ro/SSA (p = 0.001), anti-La/SSB (p = 0.001), low C4 levels (p = 0.001), and low CH50 (p = 0.001) in comparison with the other 2 groups."
2119,228,A higher rate of lymphoma development was observed in patients with class 4 involvement.
2120,228,Adjusted multivariate Cox regression analysis showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 10.51 (p = 0.002) and Kaplan-Meier analysis a log-rank of 0.0005.
2121,228,Mortality was 5-fold higher in patients with class 4 involvement.
2122,228,Adjusted multivariate Cox regression analysis showed an HR of 5.33 (p = 0.001) and Kaplan-Meier analysis a log-rank of 0.033.
2123,228,"CONCLUSION: Patients with SS presenting with severe scintigraphic involvement at diagnosis had a more pronounced autoimmune expression, a higher risk of developing systemic features and lymphoma, and a lower survival rate."
2124,228,Study of the degree of salivary gland dysfunction at diagnosis by parotid scintigraphy offers valuable clinical information on the prognosis and outcome of primary SS.
2125,229,"Lymphocytic infiltration of different exocrine and non-exocrine epithelia is the pathological hallmark of primary Sjgren's syndrome, whereas involvement of salivary and lachrymal glands with the clinical counterpart of dry eye and dry mouth are the predominant features of the disease, together with fatigue and musculoskeletal pain."
2126,229,"In addition, systemic manifestations, like arthritis, skin vasculitis, peripheral neuropathy, glomerulonephritis, may also be present in a consistent number of patients."
2127,229,"As result, clinical features in SS can be divided into two facets: the benign subjective but disabling manifestations such as dryness, pain and fatigue, and the systemic manifestations."
2128,229,"In the past decades, a core set of domains, which included sicca symptoms, objective measurements of tear and saliva production, fatigue, quality of life, disease activity and damage was indicated as essential for outcome assessment in this disorder."
2129,229,"Afterwards, great efforts have been made to develop valid tools for the assessment of different domains."
2130,229,"Specific questionnaires such as the Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort (PROFAD) and Sicca Symptoms Inventory (SSI) have been proposed as dedicated tools for the evaluation of patients symptoms, whereas different composite indexes have been suggested for the assessment of disease activity and damage."
2131,229,"Some of these preliminary studies served as bases of an international project supported by EULAR, aimed at developing two consensus disease activity indexes: the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patients Reported Index (ESSPRI), and the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), a systemic activity index to assess systemic manifestations."
2132,229,A detailed and critical review of all these indexes is provided in this article.
2133,229,"Both EULAR indexes showed, in recent studies, to be feasible, valid, and reliable instruments."
2134,229,"After their final validation, which is currently in process, they could be used as consensus outcome criteria in therapeutic trials and in clinical practice."
2135,230,"The manifestations and complications of Sjgren's syndrome are important to know, and dentists can play an important role in the detection of this disease."
2136,230,This report highlights such a case.
2137,231,The article reviews the results of Russian and foreign studies concerning the search of susceptibility genes for widespread multifactorial diseases: Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis.
2138,231,"Studying regularity patterns of genome changes in autoimmune processes with ophthalmic manifestations and their correlation with the severity of dry keratoconjunctivitis will contribute to a better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of eye manifestations of the diseases, and will also allow the development of new effective methods of diagnosis and targeted therapy."
2139,232,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and ACR Classification Criteria for SS in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases.
2140,232,"METHODS: Three hundred and fifty patients with primary SS, SLE, RA or scleroderma were randomly selected from our patient registry."
2141,232,"Each patient was clinically diagnosed as probable/definitive SS or non-SS following a standardized evaluation including clinical symptoms and manifestations, confirmatory tests, fluorescein staining test, autoantibodies, lip biopsy and medical chart review."
2142,232,"Using the clinical diagnosis as the gold standard, the degree of agreement with each criteria set and between the criteria sets was estimated."
2143,232,RESULTS: One hundred fifty-four (44%) patients were diagnosed with SS.
2144,232,The AECG criteria were incomplete in 36 patients (10.3%) and the ACR criteria in 96 (27.4%; P < 0.001).
2145,232,"Nevertheless, their ability to classify patients was almost identical, with a sensitivity of 61.6 vs 62.3 and a specificity of 94.3 vs 91.3, respectively."
2146,232,"Either set of criteria was met by 123 patients (80%); 95 (61.7%) met the AECG criteria and 96 (62.3%) met the ACR criteria, but only 68 (44.2%) patients met both sets."
2147,232,"The concordance rate between clinical diagnosis and AECG or ACR criteria was moderate (k statistic 0.58 and 0.55, respectively)."
2148,232,"Among 99 patients with definitive SS sensitivity was 83.3 vs 77.7 and specificity was 90.8 vs 85.6, respectively."
2149,232,A discrepancy between clinical diagnosis and criteria was seen in 59 patients (17%).
2150,232,"CONCLUSION: The feasibility of the SS AECG criteria is superior to that of the ACR criteria, however, their performance was similar among patients with systemic autoimmune diseases."
2151,232,A subset of SS patients is still missed by both criteria sets.
2152,233,"The authors present the case of a 50 years old woman who during 3 years had a transient right limbs palsy, and numerous episodes of unilateral/bilateral optic neuropathy."
2153,233,The CSF and MRI examinations did not sustain the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS).
2154,233,"After 2 years from the onset, she presented bilateral trigeminal neuropathy, and after 9 months the anti-SS-A and anti SS-B antibodies were positive."
2155,233,The sialography and the minor salivary ducts biopsy (in the absence of xerostomia and xerophthalmia) have established the diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
2156,233,"Subsequently, the patient presented spastic paraparesis, the clinical and imagistical features have suggested the diagnosis of acute transverse myelitis C4-T4."
2157,233,The treatment administered (corticosteroids and IGIV) improved the clinical state.
2158,233,"The authors analyse then cases with SLE and cases with pSS, whose initial diagnosis was MS possibly with no evidence of collagen tissue disorders (CD) for many years."
2159,233,"In conclusion, screening for biomarkers of SLE or pSS should be systematically performed in a case of acute or chronic myelopathy."
2160,233,"Some laboratory tests as CSF examination, the antibodies type, cranial and spinal MRI, are useful for the differential diagnosis with MS."
2161,233,"In a neurological clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) the diagnosis of MS should be precautiously established; the close follow-up of patients is always necessary, those with atypical neurological symptoms for MS, relapsing-remitting form, or lack of response to the common treatment for MS, should be examined for CD."
2162,234,OBJECTIVES: Desiccation of the vocal tract can cause many voice problems.
2163,234,"Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) with dry mouth have more voice-related problems than controls without the disease and to determine the factors affecting voice in pSS patients."
2164,234,"METHODS: Patients with pSS and controls complaining of voice-related symptoms underwent acoustic analysis, aerodynamic study and stroboscopic analysis."
2165,234,They also completed the voice handicap index (VHI) questionnaire and perceptual voice analysis (GRBAS).
2166,234,Various disease-related parameters were obtained from pSS registry data.
2167,234,RESULTS: Fifty-five pSS patients and 52 controls were analysed.
2168,234,"The subjects were all female, and mean age was 53.9 years."
2169,234,"VHI score was significantly higher in the pSS patient group (median [interquartile range], 11 [3-30] vs. 5.5 [0- 15.75], p=0.014)."
2170,234,"However, the results of acoustic analysis aerodynamic study and stroboscopic findings were not different between the two groups."
2171,234,Disease-related parameters were available in 47 pSS patients.
2172,234,"Correlation analysis revealed that jitter value positively correlated with ESSDAI (spearman's rho = 0.29, p=0.048) and patient global assessment (rho=0.3, p= 0.04)."
2173,234,"High VHI score was associated with low quality of life measured by EQ5D (rho=-0.493, p=0.0001)."
2174,234,"Of note, patients with longer disease duration ( 40 months) showed higher noise-to-harmonics ratio (NHR)."
2175,234,"CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pSS had higher VHI score, which was associated with low quality of life and longer disease duration was associated with increased noise in pSS patients."
2176,234,"The likelihood of voice problems should be addressed with pSS patients, and vocal hygiene education will be important in those patients."
2177,235,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we describe recent progress in the clinical epidemiology of sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM)."
2178,235,"RECENT FINDINGS: In a population-based, retrospective study from Norway, performed with a denominator population of 2.6 million; and with cases defined by the 1997 and/or 2011 European Neuro-Muscular Centre Research Diagnostic criteria, the estimated point prevalence of IBM was 3.3/100000."
2179,235,"Mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 5.6 years, longer than in earlier studies."
2180,235,"The male to female ratio was 3:2, and the mean age at diagnosis 67 years, very similar to figures reported this year from a nationwide, Dutch myopathy registry."
2181,235,"Coexisting rheumatic diseases were recorded in 25% of Norwegian IBM cases, with Sjgren's syndrome as the most commonly encountered."
2182,235,"Mortality was increased in IBM, with a standardized mortality rate of 1.7, but there was no indication of increased cancer risk."
2183,235,SUMMARY: Population-based data indicate that the prevalence of IBM in Europe is higher than expected from previous studies.
2184,235,Diagnostic delay appears to be a persisting problem in IBM; a major challenge with promising new therapies on the horizon.
2185,236,We report on a case of necrotizing keratoscleritis in primary Sjogren's syndrome.
2186,236,"A 66-year-old female patient who was complaining of ocular pain, tearing and decreased vision in her right eye for the previous two days was admitted to our hospital."
2187,236,"Visual acuity in the right eye was hand movement, and initial examination showed a 3.0  1.8 mm uveal mass bulging through a corneoscleral melting site in the nasal region of the right eye."
2188,236,"Positive anti-nuclear antibody was identified at a titer of 1:320 with a speckled pattern, and both Sjogren's syndrome A and Sjogren's syndrome B antibody tests were positive, with titers >200 U/mL."
2189,236,A technetium 99m pertechnetate salivary scan revealed chronic sialoadenitis in the submandibular glands.
2190,236,We diagnosed the lesion as necrotizing keratoscleritis due to primary Sjogren's syndrome.
2191,236,"A corneoscleral patch graft was performed, followed by immunosuppression including oral cyclosporin and topical prednisolone."
2192,236,"During a follow-up period of 12 months, the corneoscleral graft was well maintained with no recurrence."
2193,237,IIntroduction: Sjgren's syndrome in childhood is a rare autoimmune disease and mostly under-diagnosed.
2194,237,The aim of this study is to highlight the importance of ultrasonographic assessment of the salivary glands in children with recurrent parotitis and positive autoantibodies.
2195,237,Two cases of ultrasonographic patterns typical of Sjgren's syndrome have been described below.
2196,237,"Case 1: Female, 7 years old, reporting for 2 years recurrent parotitis, xerophthalmia, xerostomia, polyarthralgia and fever."
2197,237,"Immunological tests were positive for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La."
2198,237,"Salivary glands ultrasound was consistent with Grade 4 by the B-mode method and the spectral Doppler with presence of intense Power Doppler signal and decreased vessels internal resistance, supporting the diagnosis of juvenile Sjgren's syndrome."
2199,237,"Case 2: Female, 10 years old, reporting recurrent parotitis for 1 year and polyarthritis for 10 days."
2200,237,The supplementary tests revealed positive antibodies for Sjgren's syndrome.
2201,237,Salivary glands Ultrasound and Spectral Doppler were consistent with chronic and active inflammatory process of the salivary glands in the juvenile Sjgren's syndrome.
2202,237,DISCUSSION: Salivary glands ultrasound can be a useful exam in the diagnosis of juvenile Sjgren's syndrome.
2203,238,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by auto antibodies directed against self-antigens, immune complex formation and immune deregulations and may affect joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, nervous system, and immune system."
2204,238,The onset can be variable and the symptoms can occur for many years.
2205,238,Parotitis as the initial manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare condition and can be associated with Sjogren's syndrome.
2206,238,"In this article we present the case of a young patient who was diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome retrospectively, after she met the criteria for SLE."
2207,239,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of each item in 2002 international classification criteria for primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) in clinically diagnosed cases.
2208,239,METHODS: All patients were from the Department of Oral Medicine of Peking University School of Stomatology from 2005 to 2010.
2209,239,Their clinical manifestations and lab testing results met the standard criteria and the diagnosis was established according to international classification criteria (2002).
2210,239,We retrospectively collected all of the clinical and information and did the data analysis.
2211,239,RESULTS: A total of 148 pSS patients were included in the study.
2212,239,"When the oral evaluations were performed, 98.0% of the patients complained dry mouth, 96.6% of them had decreased non-stimulated salivary flow rate, and 60.1% had positive parotid sialography results, which was consistent with diagnosis."
2213,239,"It was found out in the lab testing that 79.7% of the patients had positive anti-SSA antibody, and 75.0% of them had elevated globulin level."
2214,239,20.3% of the patients were finally diagnosed by performing the lower lip biopsy.
2215,239,"CONCLUSION: When applying 2002 international classification criteria for the diagnosis of pSS patients, oral symptoms and unstimulated salivary flow rate are feasible and sensitive, which play an important and indicative role in the diagnosis of pSS."
2216,240,BACKGROUND: The corneal epithelium is directly affected in dry eye syndrome.
2217,240,"Thus, we attempted to describe the morphological features and evaluate the cellular density within the corneal epithelial layers in patients with non-Sjgren's (NSDE) and Sjgren's syndrome dry eyes (SSDE) by in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM)."
2218,240,METHODS: Central cornea was prospectively imaged by IVCM in 68 clinically diagnosed aqueous tear-deficient dry eyes and 10 healthy age-matched control eyes.
2219,240,Morphological characteristics of corneal epithelial layers and cellular densities were evaluated by four trained graders from the Doheny Eye Institute.
2220,240,RESULTS: Corneal epithelium in dry eyes presents morphological changes such as areas of enlarged and irregular shaped cells.
2221,240,"In comparison with controls, the density of superficial epithelial cells was decreased in both the NSDE (P<0.05) and SSDE groups (P<0.01); the density of the outer layer of wing cells was smaller but not significantly different in NSDE (P>0.05), but was lower in the SSDE group (P<0.01); the density of the inner layer of wing cells was decreased in both the NSDE (P<0.05) and SSDE groups (P<0.01) and the density of basal epithelial cells was lower in both the NSDE (P<0.01) and SSDE groups (P=0.01)."
2222,240,"For all cell counts, the interclass correlation coefficient showed good agreement between graders (ICC =0.75 to 0.93)."
2223,240,"CONCLUSIONS: IVCM represents a reliable technique for examining the corneal epithelial microstructural changes associated with dry eyes, as well as for objectively and reproducibly quantifying cell densities within all corneal epithelial layers."
2224,241,Central nervous system symptoms in patients with primary Sjogren`s syndrome are rare.
2225,241,They can present as extraglandular manifestations and require a differential diagnosis from multiple sclerosis.
2226,241,"Due to a variety of presentations, Sjogren`s syndrome with neurologic involvement may be difficult to diagnose."
2227,241,"Here, we report a case of a 75-year-old woman who was first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2010, but who was subsequently diagnosed with primary Sjogren`s syndrome 2 years later after showing signs of atypical neurologic manifestations."
2228,241,"Therefore, primary Sjogren`s syndrome should be suspected in patients who present with atypical clinical and radiologic neurologic manifestations."
2229,242,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to clarify clinical, immunological, and neuroimaging features in anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody-positive and antibody-negative Sjgren's syndrome (SS) patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement."
2230,242,METHODS: Medical records and MRI scans were retrospectively analyzed in 22 consecutive SS patients with CNS manifestations.
2231,242,RESULTS: Seven (31.8%) patients were positive for anti-AQP4 antibodies.
2232,242,"The frequency of visual impairment was higher in anti-AQP4 antibody-positive patients than in antibody-negative patients (71.4% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.0008)."
2233,242,"Brain MRI showed that discrete lesions were more commonly found in the cerebrum, brainstem, and optic nerve in anti-AQP4 antibody-positive patients than in antibody-negative patients (p = 0.002, p = 0.006, and p = 0.004, respectively), while spinal cord MRI showed that posterior column lesions in the cervical spinal cord were more frequent in anti-AQP4 antibody-positive patients than in antibody-negative patients (71.4% vs. 14.3%, p = 0.01)."
2234,242,SS-A antibody titers were higher in anti-AQP4 antibody-positive patients than in antibody-negative patients (p = 0.012) and were also higher in patients with longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions (LESCLs) than in those without LESCLs (p = 0.019).
2235,242,"CONCLUSIONS: In SS, the presence of anti-AQP4 antibodies is associated with involvement of the optic nerve, cerebrum and brainstem, and with cervical posterior column lesions in the spinal cord."
2236,243,Primary Sjogren's is a multisystem autoimmune disease which predominantly affects the exocrine glands.
2237,243,pSS may occasionally present in an atypical way which may defy correct diagnosis for a considerable period of time.
2238,243,Clinically important immune-mediated cytopenia (or a combination of cytopenias) may be the first manifestation of an occult SS and have only been rarely described with Sjogren's.
2239,243,This case exemplifies the atypical presentation of pSS and hence should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained cytopenias.
2240,244,A 56-year-old male had periodic fever for 5 years and suffered from auditory hallucination and hearing impairment for 3 years.
2241,244,"Xerostomia, xerophthalmia, elevated anti-SSA/Ro tilter, positive Schirmer's test, and lymphocyte infiltrate of mucoserous gland in lip biopsy of this case confirmed the diagnosis of primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS)."
2242,244,We review literature for fever and neuropsychiatric involvement in pSS case series.
2243,244,"Though fever is present in 6-41 % pSS cases, periodic fever has not been reported."
2244,244,Auditory hallucination was rare in cases with pSS.
2245,244,The literature review alerts clinicians that fever and neurological manifestations were not uncommon in pSS cases.
2246,245,"Sjdgrens syndrome is a common autoimmune disease with highly variable clinical manifestations, making diagnosis difficult and sometimes delayed."
2247,245,"Its specific clinical presentation combines oral and ocular dryness, asthenia and joint involvement."
2248,245,"However, visceral involvement and potentially severe complications, including lymphoma, are frequently observed."
2249,245,These can be indicative of the disease and should lead to consider Sjgren's syndrome as a diagnosis.
2250,245,"Internationally agreed upon diagnostic criteria were developed to improve the ability to make a definitive diagnosis, in order to provide follow-up and appropriate treatment measures as early as possible."
2251,245,"These criteria, which include clinical, laboratory and histological measures, are easy to use in the daily practice, and make it possible to rule out the extensive differential diagnosis of sicca syndrome."
2252,246,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate major salivary gland ultrasonography (US) in relation to symptoms and findings of oral and ocular dryness, and autoimmune disease, for potential use in diagnosis and follow-up of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
2253,246,"METHODS: Patients with pSS were recruited from the Department of Rheumatology, Haukeland University Hospital."
2254,246,The parotid and submandibular salivary glands were examined by US using a simplified scoring system for glandular homogeneity and hypoechogenic areas.
2255,246,"Scans were graded on a scale 0-3, grades 0-1 considered corresponding to normal/non-specific changes and grades 2-3 to pathological changes."
2256,246,"Sicca symptoms of the mouth and eyes, salivary gland capacity, tear secretion, minor salivary gland inflammation, serum autoantibodies, and fatigue were also investigated."
2257,246,RESULTS: US was performed in 97 patients.
2258,246,Oral and ocular sicca symptoms correlated with US score and decreased saliva levels.
2259,246,Fatigue VAS correlated with oral sicca symptoms but was inversely correlated with age.
2260,246,Patients with normal/non-specific US findings tended to be older than patients with pathological US findings.
2261,246,US score correlated with unstimulated and stimulated salivary secretion and tear secretion.
2262,246,"Minor salivary gland inflammation correlated with major salivary gland US findings, and lymphoid organisation, germinal centre (GC)-like structures, in the minor salivary gland tissue biopsies was seemingly related to US pathology."
2263,246,Serum autoantibodies against Ro/SSA and/or La/SSB were associated with US pathology.
2264,246,CONCLUSIONS: US findings in major salivary glands correlate with subjective and objective oral and ocular items as well as systemic autoimmune features of pSS.
2265,246,US represents a useful imaging tool for diagnostics and follow-up of pSS.
2266,247,OBJECTIVE: To validate the American College of Rheumatology Classification (ACR) Criteria (2012) for the diagnosis of primary Sjogren's syndrome in Chinese patients.
2267,247,METHODS: All patients involved in this study came from the Department of Oral Medicine Peking University Stomatology Hospital.
2268,247,They were devided into two groups of pSS and non-pSS according to the diagnoses made by two experts.
2269,247,Both groups of the patients had completed medical records kept in the hospital.
2270,247,"RESULTS: A total of 239 pSS patients (160 with labial salivary gland biopsy, and 79 without biopsy) and 52 age-matched non-pSS patients [(55.1714.295),and (55.9013.38) years old, P>0.05] (9 with biopsy, and 43 without biopsy) were involved in this study."
2271,247,The sensitivity and specificity of ACR criteria in diagnosing pSS were 90.37 % and 88.46 % respectively.
2272,247,"The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 7.83 and 0.109, respectively."
2273,247,"The sensitivities of ACR criteria in diagnosing pSS patients with and without labial biopsy were 88.75% and 93.67 %, respectively, with specificities of 88.89% and 88.37%, respectively."
2274,247,"The most sensitive item adopted in ACR criteria was the ocular staining score with a sensitivity of 85.77%, and the most specific item was the labial salivary gland biopsy, with a specificity of 88.89%."
2275,247,"CONCLUSION: The sensitivity and specificity of ACR criteria in diagnosing Chinese pSS patients were relatively high, and may serve as the diagnosis criteria in research and clinical practice."
2276,247,"However, the ACR criteria need to be validated and further revised in the future ."
2277,248,BACKGROUND: Patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) have a considerable higher risk of lymphoma development.
2278,248,OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of lymphoma and the value of biomarkers to predict lymphoma development in patients with SS.
2279,248,METHODS: Clinical files of all patients with a presumed diagnosis of SS between 1991 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed for the development of lymphoma.
2280,248,Biochemical data were plotted as a function of the relative time before and after the lymphoma diagnosis (for patients who developed lymphoma) or before the last available blood test (for patients who did not develop lymphoma).
2281,248,Correlations between several biochemical parameters and development of lymphoma were analyzed by logistic regression.
2282,248,"In order to evaluate the evolution of cryoglobulins, a random effect model with random intercepts was used."
2283,248,RESULTS: Sixteen patients developed a lymphoma (prevalence 8.9%; median follow-up 6years).
2284,248,"Cryoglobulins were significantly higher in these patients (n=16), when compared to the rest of patients (n=164) without lymphoma (121250 versus 824.9mg/L for IgG; 231422 versus 1330mg/L for IgM; 1020 versus 14mg/L for IgA in the cryoprecipitate)."
2285,248,Cryoglobulin-levels were significantly more increasing (p-values for IgG=0.0007; for IgM=0.0123; and for IgA in the cryoprecipitate <0.0001) in the time period before the lymphoma diagnosis (patients with lymphoma) compared to the time period before the last available blood test (patients without lymphoma).
2286,248,Also low (i.e.
2287,248,"under the detection limit) C3 (OR 13.9) or C4 (OR 7.1) levels, a progressively decreasing total complement activity (OR 6.6), progressively decreasing gammaglobulins (OR 13.4), a persistent detection of monoclonal bands (OR 14.6) on protein electrophoresis, a persistent low or decreasing serum IgG (OR 18), and decreasing IgM-serum levels (OR 17.7) were significantly associated with lymphoma."
2288,248,"CONCLUSION: Periodically follow-up of laboratory markers, such as cryogloblins, over time proved to be an accurate way to predict lymphoma."
2289,249,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) primarily involves exocrine glands, and renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is seen in one-third of the cases."
2290,249,RTA with hypokalemic paralysis as a presenting feature of pSS is described in few case reports in literature.
2291,249,"We report 13 cases who presented as hypokalemic paralysis, and on evaluation were diagnosed to be pSS, as per the diagnostic criteria laid by the Sjgren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (2012)."
2292,249,"All patients were female, with a mean age at presentation being 33.1  8.22 years (range, 25-48 years)."
2293,249,Eleven patients had a complete distal RTA and two patients had incomplete distal RTA at the time of presentation.
2294,249,62% (8/13) of patients had no signs and symptoms of exocrine gland involvement.
2295,249,"All the cases were managed with oral alkali therapy, and six patients received additional immunomodulating agents."
2296,249,No improvement in renal tubular dysfunction (in the form of a reduction in the alkali dose) after immunomodulating therapy was observed over a mean follow-up of 2.8 years.
2297,249,Renal tubular dysfunction can be the presenting manifestation of pSS.
2298,249,It is important to consider the possible presence of this disorder in adults with otherwise unexplained distal RTA or hypokalemia.
2299,250,"The intrinsic and complex nature of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) makes it difficult to identify risk factors that can predict the development and outcome of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), yet patients at high risk for such complication seem to bear certain clinic-serological characteristics that render them a unique profile."
2300,250,"In the last decade, research focusing on B-cell hyperactivity as the hallmark of pSS-related lymphoproliferation has shed light on certain biological and molecular factors that participate in disease evolution and lymphoma development, thus indicating possible predictors of lymphoma development and outcome."
2301,250,"In this review, we explore all the available data concerning the clinical picture, risk prognostication and outcome of pSS-associated NHLs."
2302,251,A case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) occurring on low dose immunosuppression for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is presented.
2303,251,Neurologic changes in patients with SLE or SS should not be assumed to be a disease manifestation.
2304,251,"Importantly, serious opportunistic infections such as PML can occur in minimally immunosuppressed rheumatic patients."
2305,251,"Early diagnosis, facilitated by scrutiny of MRI findings, should trigger measures to reconstitute immunity in an otherwise fatal disease."
2306,252,"Sjgren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease which is characterized by xerosis, and multiple organs can be affected, causing interstitial lung disease, renal tubular acidosis, blood system involvement, peripheral neuropathy, and liver damage, but cardiac involvement is rare."
2307,252,Here we report a case of Sjgren's syndrome with prominent aortic valve involvement.
2308,252,"A 66-year-old woman was admitted for exertional dyspnea, and the ultrasonic cardiogram showed severe aortic stenosis with moderate regurgitation."
2309,252,"Preoperative examination for valve replacement found that the patient had elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and positive rheumatoid factor, so she was referred to the rheumatology outpatient department for further examination and treatment."
2310,252,"Further questions about medical history found that the patient had dry eyes and dry mouth for more than ten years, and had obvious caries."
2311,252,Further laboratory examination showed elevated serum immunoglobulin levels and positive anti-nuclear antibody.
2312,252,The findings of ophthalmologic examination and labial gland biopsy also supported the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome.
2313,252,"After treatment of glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine for ten months, her dyspnea symptoms were obviously improved in the patient, and the rheumatoid factor had become negative while her erythrocyte sedimentation rate normal."
2314,252,Repeated ultrasonic cardiogram examination showed that her aortic stenosis was also improved.
2315,252,"The patient has been followed up for four years, and her condition kept stable."
2316,252,"Cardiac involvement in Sjgren's syndrome can affect all parts of the heart, but valve involvement is relatively rare."
2317,252,The specific relationship between cardiac involvement and Sjgren's syndrome and the mechanisms behind these associations both need further research.
2318,253,PURPOSE: To report a case of dermatomyositis (DM) with secondary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and propose the clinical application of technetium-99m pyrophosphate ((99m)Tc-PYP) scan.
2319,253,"CASE REPORT: A 50-year-old woman had progressive proximal muscle weakness of bilateral thighs, myalgia, tea-colored urine, and exercise intolerance for 6 months."
2320,253,"Physical examination showed malar rash, V-sign, periungual erythema, and mechanic hands."
2321,253,"Neurological assessment showed symmetric pelvic-girdle weakness, myopathic face, waddling gait, but preserved deep tendon reflex and sensory functions."
2322,253,DM was diagnosed on the basis of typical rashes and serum creatinine kinase elevation (7397 IU/L).
2323,253,"Aside from myopathic symptoms, dry eye and mouth were reported."
2324,253,Thorough autoantibody searches showed positive anti-SSA/Ro antibody (198 U/ml).
2325,253,"Both Schirmer's test and sialoscintigraphy were positive, leading secondary SS as diagnosis."
2326,253,"Initial (99m)Tc-PYP scan revealed increased radiouptake in the muscles of bilateral thighs, compatible with clinical assessment."
2327,253,"Followup scan three months later shows abnormal but attenuated radiouptake at bilateral thighs, in the presence of nearly-complete clinical recovery."
2328,253,"CONCLUSION: DM with secondary SS in adult is a unique disease entity, with predominantly myopathic symptoms and satisfactory therapeutic response as its characteristics."
2329,253,"Our serial muscle imaging studies suggest that (99m)Tc-PYP scan is at once anatomically-specific and persistently-sensitive to microstructural damages within inflammatory muscles, enabling clinician to monitor disease activity and therapeutic response."
2330,254,"PURPOSE: Primary Sjogren syndrome (PSS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by symptoms of a dry mouth and eyes, in which other organs and systems are widely involved."
2331,254,Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in PSS is reported in a wide range between 2.5-60%.
2332,254,The reason is that the clinical picture can remain asymptomatic despite the presence of CNS involvement in the disease process.
2333,254,"In this study, our aim was to evaluate subclinical cognitive impairment in patients with PSS by investigating P300 potential parameters."
2334,254,METHOD: Forty-three female patients with PSS (mean age: 52.611.4 years) and 35 healthy female controls (mean age: 54.58.09 years) were included in the study.
2335,254,Mini-Mental State evaluations (MMSE) and brain MRI were performed in the patient and control groups.
2336,254,An event-related evoked potentials test (P300) was applied to those with normal MMSE.
2337,254,RESULTS: The P300 latencies of patients with PSS were significantly longer compared with the control group (p=.019).
2338,254,"In patients with PSS, there was no difference in P300 parameters between ANA, Anti-SSA, Anti-SSB-positive and negative patients, and patients with or without sedimentation and CRP elevation."
2339,254,"In addition, brain MRI revealed no statistically significant difference between patients with PSS with and without ischemic gliotic lesions (p=.48)."
2340,254,"CONCLUSION: In our study, P300 latency was also found to be significantly longer in patients who had no white matter change."
2341,254,We believe that prolonged P300 potential latencies without associated white matter lesions in brain imaging may be associated with subclinical CNS involvement.
2342,255,A 58-year-old Chinese woman with well controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus presented with acute and progressive bilateral lower limb weakness.
2343,255,"Investigations revealed severe hypokalaemia (1.3 mmol/L) and hypophosphataemia (<0.32 mmol/L) with rhabdomyolysis and electrocardiogram changes, without other concurrent biochemical abnormalities."
2344,255,Immediate intravenous and oral potassium and phosphate replacement was initiated with objective improvement in weakness with replenished electrolyte levels.
2345,255,Urine studies confirmed renal potassium wasting.
2346,255,"Further history revealed frequent dental caries, xerostomia and recent weight loss."
2347,255,A computerised tomography scan showed atrophy of her salivary glands and a skin lesion biopsied by her GP in the past had been histologically characterised as anetoderma.
2348,255,The constellation of these findings and subsequent positive anti-SSA/SSB levels confirmed her diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS).
2349,255,"PSS has a wide spectrum of renal involvement and should be a differential diagnosis when investigating interstitial nephritis and electrolyte abnormalities, particularly in patients with coexisting autoimmune conditions."
2350,256,We present a case of a 67-year-old woman admitted from the neurology clinic for further investigations of progressive ataxia and sensory symptoms.
2351,256,Neurological examination showed reduced pinprick and absent vibration sensations in the lower limbs.
2352,256,Motor system examination was normal.
2353,256,Her antinuclear antibodies titre was 1:100 with positive Ro antibodies.
2354,256,Her initial nerve conduction studies were normal.
2355,256,"However, the lower limb somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP) demonstrated impairment of central sensory conduction pathway."
2356,256,Rheumatology review revealed a history of fatigue and Sicca symptoms and her Schirmer's test was strongly positive.
2357,256,This lead to the diagnosis of ganglionopathy associated to Sjgren's syndrome.
2358,256,She had an excellent response to intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone and intravenous cyclophosphamide infusions.
2359,256,This case highlights that dorsal column involvement can precede the diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome.
2360,257,"Herein, we describe a 44-year-old female diagnosed with histologically proven coexistence of primary Sjgren's syndrome and sarcoidosis with pulmonary and muscular involvement."
2361,257,"The differential diagnosis may be difficult, but this is not an exceptional case, which highlights the need to critically revise the consideration of sarcoidosis as an exclusion for primary Sjgren's syndrome, as established in current classification criteria."
2362,258,INTRODUCTION: The aims of this study were to assess agreement between the currently used 2002 American-European Consensus Group (AECG) classification criteria and the new 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and to identify potential sources of disagreement.
2363,258,METHODS: We studied 105 patients between 2006 and 2013 from the Brittany cohort of patients with suspected SS.
2364,258,"AECG criteria were applied using only Schimer's test and unstimulated whole salivary flow (UWSF) to assess objective ocular and oral involvement, since these are the tests most physicians use in clinical practice."
2365,258,Agreement between the two sets of criteria was assessed using Cohen's  coefficient.
2366,258,"RESULTS: Of those studied, 42 patients fulfilled AECG and 35 ACR criteria."
2367,258,Agreement between the two sets was moderate (=0.53).
2368,258,"Patients fulfilling ACR but not AECG criteria (n=8) were significantly younger and had shorter symptom durations, but only three of them had SS in the opinion of the evaluating physician."
2369,258,Xerostomia and xerophthalmia (AECG set only) did not discriminate between patients with and without SS.
2370,258,The use of UWSF in the AECG but not the ACR criteria explained part of the disagreement.
2371,258,The serological item in the ACR set (positive rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody 1:320 or anti-SSA/SSB positivity) did not result in classification differences compared to anti-SSA/SSB antibody alone (AECG set).
2372,258,Agreement between ocular staining score 3 (ACR set) and Schirmer's test 5 mm/5 min (AECG set) was very low (=0.14).
2373,258,"CONCLUSIONS: Agreement was only moderate between ACR and AECG criteria, suggesting these two sets would not select comparable patient populations."
2374,258,An international consensus about which classification criteria should be used in clinical studies is needed.
2375,259,"To investigate in a long-term study, the development of new extra-glandular manifestations (EGM) or associated auto-immune diseases (AID) from 1 year after establishing the diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
2376,259,"The primary goal was to examine the frequency and type of these manifestations and to find out which demographic, clinical and serological profile was most at risk."
2377,259,"All outpatients diagnosed with primary Sjgren's syndrome were included in a retrospective study, with at least one check-up per year, from June 1991 until August 2015."
2378,259,Patients also fulfilling the criteria for concomitant connective tissue disorders were excluded.
2379,259,Data were collected with respect to the cumulative prevalence of a new EGM or associated AID.
2380,259,140 patients were included in the final analysis.
2381,259,"After 10 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of a new EGM or associated AID was 30.7%."
2382,259,"The most frequent events were polyneuropathy, interstitial lung disease, (poly)arthritis, discoid lupus erythematosus (LE)/subacute cutaneous LE and Hashimoto's disease."
2383,259,Non-Hodgkin lymphoma was not diagnosed during the follow-up.
2384,259,"Patients without chronic benign pain syndrome (CBP) (HR 2.13; 95% CI [0.94-4.76]; p=0.061), but in particular those with cryoglobulins (HR 2.87; 95% CI [1.20-6.86]; p=0.013), developed more events."
2385,259,"Age at diagnosis, gender, the presence of ANA, anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, IgM-RF, decreased levels of C3 or C4, or hypergammaglobulinaemia did not show any statistically significant differences."
2386,259,The burden of disease in pSS is higher than expected due to the development of EGM or associated AID.
2387,259,"Therefore, we recommend long-term follow-up of all pSS patients, particularly those with cryoglobulinaemia."
2388,260,"OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship of the presence of secondary SS with disease activity, duration in RA."
2389,260,"METHODS: Eighty two patients with RA were submitted to Schirmer test, minor salivary gland biopsy, questionnaire on sicca symptoms, DAS-28 4v determination."
2390,260,"RESULTS: In this population, 20 (24.3%) patients fulfilled the American-European classification criteria for secondary SS."
2391,260,No relation could be found between the presence of secondary SS and disease activity (p = 0.31) and RA duration (p = 0.95).
2392,260,CONCLUSION: Appearance of Secondary SS in RA patients is independent of RA duration or activity.
2393,261,Two middle-aged female patients presenting with heart palpitation and electrocardiogram revealed complex cardiac arrhythmias.
2394,261,"A review of systems was positive for dry mouth and transient arthralgia, while laboratory and instrumental tests enabled us to make the diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
2395,261,Cardiac electrophysiology revealed atrioventricular node dysfunction and impaired intraventricular conduction.
2396,261,Prednisone therapy induced a significant improvement in symptoms and electrocardiographic readings.
2397,261,The diagnosis of pSS should be considered in a patient presenting with complex cardiac arrhythmias.
2398,262,PURPOSE: To determine the diverse clinical features of optic neuropathy associated with primary Sjgren's syndrome in Korean patients.
2399,262,METHODS: Five women with acute and/or chronic optic neuropathy who were diagnosed as primary Sjgren's syndrome were retrospectively evaluated.
2400,262,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome was diagnosed by signs and symptoms of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, positive serum anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB antibodies, and/or minor salivary gland biopsy."
2401,262,All patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination.
2402,262,"RESULTS: Among the five patients diagnosed as optic neuropathy related to primary Sjgren's syndrome, four patients had bilateral optic neuropathy and one patient was unilateral."
2403,262,The clinical course was chronic in three patients and one of them showed acute exacerbation and was finally diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.
2404,262,The other two patients presented as acute optic neuritis and one was diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.
2405,262,"Sicca symptoms were present in four patients, but only two patients reported these symptoms before the onset of optic neuropathy."
2406,262,"Patients showed minimal response to systemic corticosteroids or steroid dependence, requiring plasmapheresis in the acute phase and immunosuppressive agents for maintenance therapy."
2407,262,"CONCLUSIONS: Optic neuropathy associated with primary Sjgren's syndrome may show variable clinical courses, including acute optic neuritis, insidious progression of chronic optic atrophy, or in the context of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders."
2408,262,"Optic neuropathy may be the initial manifestation of primary Sjgren's syndrome without apparent sicca symptoms, which makes the diagnosis often difficult."
2409,262,"The presence of specific antibodies including anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, and anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies are supportive for the diagnosis and treatment in atypical cases of optic neuropathy."
2410,263,"A 40-year-old female presented with cough, exertional dyspnea, abdominal pain with distention, fatigue, dry eyes and dry mouth."
2411,263,Past history revealed asthma.
2412,263,Physical examination was normal except for tachypnea.
2413,263,"We found leukocytosis, azygos fissure on chest X-ray along with normal pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gases."
2414,263,Thorax computed tomography (CT) revealed bronchiectasis and ground glass opacities in both lungs.
2415,263,Abdominal CT demonstrated thrombosed proximal splenic artery aneurysm.
2416,263,"Further diagnostic procedures were done and according to the positive Schirmer test and compatible histopathologic findings of the salivary gland, diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome was established."
2417,263,Splenic artery aneurysm is rare occurring in less than 1% of the population that usually appears as an incidental finding.
2418,263,This is the first case in literature that introduces Sjgren's syndrome as a risk factor for splenic artery aneurysm.
2419,263,The silent presentation of the splenic artery aneurysm should previse the clinicians that such an occurrence may cause a significant diagnostic dilemma.
2420,264,"PURPOSE: Sjgren syndrome (SS), although commonly associated with xerostomia and xerophthalmia, can present with extraglandular manifestations that make definitive diagnosis difficult."
2421,264,The 2 leading diagnostic classification systems include a positive minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) result as a major inclusion criterion.
2422,264,The purpose of this study was to better define the role of the MSGB in establishing a diagnosis of SS in a cohort of referred patients.
2423,264,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients referred to the Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (Boston, MA) over a 5-year period to establish a diagnosis of SS."
2424,264,"Inclusion criteria were complete information regarding presenting symptoms, reason for referral, and findings at MSGB."
2425,264,Incomplete records and referral for reasons other than presumptive SS resulted in exclusion.
2426,264,"The MSGB and its role in definitive diagnosis based on accepted classification systems were evaluated for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values."
2427,264,"Other variables of interest (demographics, pattern of referral, and symptomology) are described for the cohort."
2428,264,RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria.
2429,264,"The mean age was 48.3years (range, 19 to 74yr) and 75 were women (86.2%)."
2430,264,Fifteen MSGB results (17.2%) were positive based on the focus score histologic criteria.
2431,264,"In 12 of 15 cases, the positive MSGB result allowed for a definitive diagnosis (80%)."
2432,264,"In 3 cases, other criteria allowed diagnosis without the contribution of the MSGB (sensitivity of MSGB, 80.0%; specificity, 87.5%; positive predictive value, 57.1%; negative predictive value, 95.5%)."
2433,264,CONCLUSION: The MSGB is an important contributor to a diagnosis of SS.
2434,264,"When serology was negative, the MSGB often was the criterion that allowed the diagnosis to be established."
2435,264,It is the most frequently positive of the major criteria used by the 2 classification systems in current use.
2436,265,"A 56-year-old woman presented with recurrent pain and swelling of left knee, Raynaud's phenomenon and dry mouth."
2437,265,"She was initially diagnosed with primary Sjgren's syndrome and was put on prednisone, which substantially relieved her complaints."
2438,265,"But 8 months later, pain and swelling of left knee recurred with spiking fever, chills and shortness of breath."
2439,265,Escalation of prednisone did not improve the pain and swelling of left knee.
2440,265,CT of chest revealed pulmonary interstitial changes with coexisting infection.
2441,265,"MRI of left knee was highly consistent with tuberculous arthritis, which was further confirmed by positive blood culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and acid-fast stain of synovial fluid."
2442,266,BACKGROUND.
2443,266,"Primary Sjgren syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease, especially in children, mainly affecting girls (77%), and usually diagnosed around 10 years of age."
2444,266,"Diagnosis during childhood is difficult, especially because of the diversity of the clinical presentation and difficulty obtaining reliable history data, accounting for a higher frequency of underdiagnosed cases."
2445,266,"Differential conditions should be considered, especially the ones that promote xerostomia, such as diabetes, ectodermal dysplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, HIV and HTLV infection."
2446,266,"Conditions associated with parotid enlargement should also be excluded, including juvenile recurrent parotitis (JRP), sialadenosis, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, infectious parotitis caused by streptococcal and staphylococcal infections, viral infections (paramyxovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and parvovirus), and diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (associated with HIV infection), and rare congenital conditions, such as polycystic parotid disease."
2447,266,CASE REPORT.
2448,266,"A paediatric female patient was referred to our clinic for dental treatment complaining about dry mouth, oral discomfort, and dysphagia."
2449,266,"The patient presented five of the required criteria to establish the diagnosis of pSS, including ocular symptoms, oral symptoms, evidence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, focal sialadenitis confirmed by minor salivary gland biopsy, and evidence of major salivary gland involvement."
2450,266,Our patient did not have positive SS-A and SS-B autoantibodies.
2451,266,"According to the literature, about 29% of individuals with pSS can present seronegativity for SS-A (anti-Ro) antibodies and about 33% can present seronegativity for SS-B (anti-La) antibodies."
2452,266,CONCLUSION.
2453,266,"To the best of our knowledge, this is the youngest patient reported in the scientific English literature with pSS."
2454,266,Primary Sjgren syndrome has a wide clinical and immunologic spectrum and may progress with increased morbidity.
2455,266,Clinicians must be aware of the development of pSS in such an early age and exclude all possible differential findings to provide early diagnosis and treatment.
2456,267,Sjogren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease witch affects mostly lachrymal and salivary glands.
2457,267,The exocrinopathy can be encountered alone (primary Sjogren syndrome) or in association with other autoimmune disorders (secondary Sjogren syndrome).
2458,267,"Visual prognosis of the patients with secondary Sjogren syndrome depends on the early diagnosis, applied therapy follow-up controls along with an effective collaboration between ophthalmologist and rheumatologist."
2459,267,"We present therapeutic options in secondary Sjogren syndrome: hygiene and protective measures, medical nonspecific substitution treatment, treatment to stimulate tear secretion, autoimmune disease-specific medical treatment and surgery."
2460,268,"OBJECTIVES: Explore the presentation, diagnostic criteria and exocrine gland histopathology of paediatric primary Sjgren's syndrome (PPSjS)."
2461,268,"METHODS: A case series of 8 children is reported and American-European Consensus Group (AECG-2002) criteria were examined, as well as minor labial salivary and lachrymal gland biopsies, which were scored by a pathologist blinded to outcome."
2462,268,"For all cases, connective tissue diseases and parotid-related infectious disease were excluded."
2463,268,"RESULTS: Age at onset varied from 5-13 years old; 6 were females, all followed from diagnosis up to the last visit (1-10 years)."
2464,268,"The main features at presentation were recurrent tender parotid swelling and sialectasis imaging, with decreased salivary function assessed by Tc-99 scintigraphy."
2465,268,Mild sicca symptoms were observed in 4/8 cases.
2466,268,"Systemic features, including fatigue, myalgia, arthritis, tenosynovitis, joint contractures, transient Raynaud's and high ESR, were recorded at onset."
2467,268,"Autoantibody profile was unremarkable for diagnosis, while lymphocytic infiltration of labial salivary glands and sialectasis were observed in all biopsies (8/8)."
2468,268,"In lachrymal glands, massive lymphocytic infiltration and lymphocytic gastritis were observed during complementary assessment."
2469,268,"Flares were treated with low dose steroids and long-term use of hydroxychloroquine (5/8), although only 3/8 fulfilled AECG-2002 diagnostic criteria, throughout the disease course."
2470,268,"CONCLUSIONS: PPSjS is rare, slowly progressive and its early presentation is variable."
2471,268,Standardised diagnostic algorithms should include recurrent parotid swelling and early diagnosis should rely mostly on salivary and lachrymal gland histopathology in this age group.
2472,269,OBJECTIVES: This study examined quality of life burden of voice disorders in Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
2473,269,"METHODS: Patients with SS (n = 101) completed interviews involving patient-reported histories of voice disorders, specific voice symptoms, SS disease severity, the Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL), and the general health-related quality of life Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaires."
2474,269,"Relationships among voice symptoms, disease severity, and quality-of-life measures were examined and compared with patient-reported voice disorders."
2475,269,"RESULTS: Significant correlations were observed among voice symptoms, disease severity, V-RQOL, SF-36, and patient-reported voice disorders (P < .05)."
2476,269,Patients with SS who reported a voice disorder experienced a greater burden on general quality of life as compared with those without voice disorders.
2477,269,"Specific voice symptoms significantly correlated with reduced SF-36 scores included frequent throat-clearing, throat soreness, difficulty projecting, and vocal discomfort."
2478,269,"Despite the added burden of a voice disorder on quality of life in SS, voice-related treatment seeking was low (15.8%)."
2479,269,"However, the majority of patients who received voice treatment reported voice improvement."
2480,269,CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with SS frequently experience voice disorders and specific voice-related symptoms that are associated with reduced quality of life.
2481,269,These findings have important implications for voice referral practices and voice disorder symptom management in this population.
2482,270,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a frequent autoimmune systemic disease, clinically characterized by eyes and mouth dryness in all patients, salivary gland swelling or extraglandular systemic manifestations in half of the patients, and development of lymphoma in 5 to 10 % of the patients."
2483,270,"However, patients presenting with sicca symptoms or salivary gland swelling may have a variety of conditions that may require very different investigations, treatments, or follow-up."
2484,270,"Eye and/or mouth dryness is a frequent complaint in clinical setting, and its frequency increases with age."
2485,270,"When evaluating a patient with suspected pSS, the first step is to rule out its differential diagnoses, before looking for positive arguments for the disease."
2486,270,Knowledge of normal and abnormal lachrymal and salivary gland physiology allows the clinician to prescribe the most adapted procedures for evaluating their function and structure.
2487,270,"New tests have been developed in recent years for evaluating these patients, notably new ocular surface staining scores or salivary gland ultrasonography."
2488,270,We describe the different diagnoses performed in our monocentric cohort of 240 patients with suspected pSS.
2489,270,"The most frequent diagnoses are pSS, other systemic autoimmune diseases, idiopathic sicca syndrome and drug-induced sicca syndrome."
2490,270,"However, other diseases are important to rule out due to their specific management, such as sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangeitis, IgG4-related disease, chronic hepatitis C virus or human immunodeficiency virus infections, graft-versus-host disease, and head and neck radiation therapy."
2491,270,"At the light of these data, we propose a core of minimal investigations to be performed when evaluating a patient with suspected pSS."
2492,271,PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a rare autoimmune liver disease that increasingly is diagnosed at early stages of disease.
2493,271,"Although survival has improved, a majority suffers from one or more symptom complexes associated with PBC."
2494,271,"Much remains unknown about the mechanisms, significance, or effective treatment of these symptoms."
2495,271,The present review will outline the latest understanding and management of the most common symptoms of PBC.
2496,271,"RECENT FINDINGS: Patients rate fatigue as the most impactful on their quality of life, yet its specificity to PBC remains unsettled."
2497,271,"Both central and peripheral nervous system mechanisms have been proposed, but remain enigmatic."
2498,271,Lysophosphatidic acid and G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 have emerged as potential targets for cholestatic-specific pathways of pruritus.
2499,271,Fibrates have also shown promise as a new class of antipruritic in cholestatic patients.
2500,271,"PBC and Sjogren's syndrome share many demographic and histological features, but the clinical significance of their association is not well understood."
2501,271,"SUMMARY: Common symptoms in PBC carry an increasing share of the disease burden as patients live longer, yet existing therapies are frequently ineffective or poorly tolerated."
2502,271,Targeted therapies may emerge as the molecular pathways of PBC-associated symptoms are unraveled.
2503,272,"INTRODUCTION: Amyloidosis accompanied by Sjgren's syndrome (SS) has been reported to occur primarily in the skin, lungs, tongue, and mammary gland."
2504,272,"However, SS in association with secondary amyloidosis is rarely reported, and knowledge of its relevance is inadequate."
2505,272,Here we report a case of primary SS diagnosed simultaneously with localized amyloidosis of the lacrimal gland.
2506,272,CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old woman complaining of a left eyelid mass was referred to the hospital and was diagnosed with localized amyloidosis after excisional biopsy.
2507,272,She was then referred to the rheumatology department for additional evaluation for amyloidosis.
2508,272,"Subsequently, her diagnosis was primary SS based on the presented symptoms and results of the Schirmer test, serologic testing, and minor salivary gland biopsy."
2509,272,Pilocarpine (10mg/d) and hydroxychloroquine (200mg/d) were initiated for the treatment of SS.
2510,272,"Six months after the initial diagnosis, the dry eyes and mouth did not worsen and no masses suggestive of localized amyloidosis were reported."
2511,272,"CONCLUSION: This is a rare case of amyloidosis, localized to the lacrimal gland, with SS."
2512,272,"Therefore, despite its rarity, physicians should be aware of the potential coexistence of secondary amyloidosis, even in the localized form, in patients with SS."
2513,273,A case is presented of bilateral lacrimal gland hypertrophy with secondary glaucoma due to the increased episcleralvenous pressure.
2514,273,"Diagnostic work-up included clinical methods associated with ultrasound (A- and B-scan, Doppler ultrasound) and magnetic resonance imaging techniques."
2515,273,"Clinical data revealed proptosis, episcleral congestion, and elevated intraocular pressure."
2516,273,Abnormal Schirmer's test and xerophthalmia were also present.
2517,273,"Ultrasound examination identified enlarged masses of a cystic structure in lacrimal fossae bilaterally, superotemporally to the globe, more pronounced on the left side."
2518,273,Doppler ultrasound revealed vascularization and magnetic resonance imaging completed the findings offered by ultrasound methods.
2519,273,"Based on the clinical aspect and the possible visual impairment due to secondary glaucoma, the mass lesion on the left side was removed by neurosurgical approach."
2520,273,Histopathology confirmed destruction of the lacrimal gland and immunohistochemistry indicated Sjogren's syndrome lesions.
2521,273,Sonography is able to provide noninvasively much of the information needed by the clinician.
2522,273,"The A-scan and B-scan ultrasound techniques and color Doppler allow tracking and discrimination of orbital diseases, such as lacrimal gland lesions."
2523,273,"Associated with clinical features, these methods provide the basis of correct diagnosis and appropriate therapy for lacrimal gland pathology."
2524,274,Manifestations of autoimmune disorders represent adiagnostic challenge.
2525,274,"Many autoimmune disorders show typical manifestations in the ear, nose and throat and should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis."
2526,274,"Sjogren's syndrome, various vasculitides and sarcoidosis represent the most common autoimmune disorders in otorhinolaryngology, but IgG4-related diseases, relapsing polychondritis and autoimmune disorders of the mucosa are also observed."
2527,274,Autoimmune diseases can lead to sensorineural deficits.
2528,274,Both hypo- and hyperthyroidism can be caused by autoimmune disorders.
2529,274,"The diagnosis is usually based on the corresponding classification criteria, whose correct application can facilitate the clarification of these diseases."
2530,275,OBJECTIVES: To characterise the serological and clinical findings in primary Sjgren's syndrome in which anti-La was found without anti-Ro.
2531,275,We hypothesised that a significant portion of these are falsely negative for anti-Ro60.
2532,275,METHODS: Twenty-nine sera from primary Sjgren's syndrome patients were tested for antibodies directed against La and Ro.
2533,275,Anti-La was detected using bovine La treated with or without DNAase and RNAase to identify potential false positivity.
2534,275,Anti-Ro60 antibodies were detected using HEp-2000 substrate (in which cells are transfected with human Ro60) and HEp-2 substrate.
2535,275,Anti-Ro60 and Ro-52 were also tested by in vitro transcription/translation followed by immunoprecipitation assay.
2536,275,"RESULTS: All 29 sera bound La, even after treatment with DNAase and RNAase."
2537,275,"Of the 29 sera, 25 were unequivocally negative on HEp-2000 (1:40 dilution)."
2538,275,"Four samples were anti-Ro60 positive with a speckled pattern, three of the four at 1:320 dilution."
2539,275,"Thus, false negative anti-Ro60 exists in a small fraction (14%) of the Ro-negative/La-positive primary Sjgren's patients."
2540,275,"However, all the samples were negative for Ro60 and Ro52 by in vitro immunoprecipitation assay."
2541,275,Clinically these patients tended not to have salivary gland pathology characteristic of Sjgren's syndrome.
2542,275,CONCLUSIONS: We found only a small fraction of Ro negative/La positive sera to show positive HEp-2000 pattern.
2543,275,"These subjects did not have characteristic findings on pathological examination of minor salivary glands, suggesting these subjects have a process distinct from Sjgren's syndrome."
2544,276,OBJECTIVES: Salivary ultrasonography (US) was evaluated as an alternative imaging modality to sialography for Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
2545,276,METHODS: Parotid sialography and parotid and submandibular US were performed in 360 patients (188 with SS and 172 non-SS) who were suspected of SS and had fulfilled the American-European criteria (AEC) for SS or had received > or =3 of the objective examinations that were considered minimal requirements for classifying non-SS and had undergone both the imaging examinations.
2546,276,"The glands were considered positive for SS if they exhibited peripheral sialoectatic changes on sialography and/or hypoechoic areas, echogenic streaks and/or irregular gland margins on US."
2547,276,The images obtained were independently rated as SS-positive or SS-negative by three radiologists in a blind fashion and the final decision was made by consensus.
2548,276,Interobserver and intermodality agreement was evaluated using kappa values for sialography and parotid and/or submandibular US.
2549,276,"RESULTS: Average kappa values for the interobserver agreement were 0.81, 0.80 and 0.82 in sialography, parotid and submandibular US, respectively, indicating very good or good agreement."
2550,276,"The kappa value for intermodality agreement between sialography and parotid US was 0.81 and between sialography and submandibular US was 0.76, indicating very good and good agreement, respectively."
2551,276,"The diagnostic ability of parotid US was significantly lower than that of sialography (p<0.001, McNemar test)."
2552,276,"However, the diagnostic ability of submandibular US was comparable to that of sialography (p=0.153)."
2553,276,CONCLUSIONS: Submandibular US is a promising technique that can be used as a practical alternative to sialography in the classification of SS.
2554,277,"OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the diagnostic performance of the MR imaging findings of the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands to discriminate between patients with and without Sjgren's syndrome."
2555,277,METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the correlation between the MR imaging and histopathological findings obtained from 69 patients with clinically suspected Sjgren's syndrome.
2556,277,"We evaluated the heterogeneous signal intensity distribution on T1- and T2-weighted images, the multiple high-signal-intensity spots on MR sialograms, and the volume of the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual salivary glands."
2557,277,"RESULTS: The multiple high-signal-intensity spots in the parotid gland showed the highest sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy (82% and 83%, respectively)."
2558,277,"In addition, the multiple high-signal-intensity spots and the heterogeneous signal intensity distribution in the submandibular gland showed high specificity (100% and 88%, respectively)."
2559,277,"The volume of the submandibular gland, but not that of the parotid or sublingual gland, was smaller in patients with Sjgren's syndrome."
2560,277,CONCLUSIONS: The presence of multiple high-signal-intensity spots on an MR sialogram in the parotid gland should be considered the best diagnostic indicator for Sjgren's syndrome.
2561,277,"The presence of spots, heterogeneity, and the change to smaller volumes in the submandibular gland were also helpful because of their high specificity, particularly in advanced cases."
2562,278,"OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to analyse the etiology, characterisation and outcomes of the different types of peripheral neuropathy in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and their association with clinical and immunological disease expression."
2563,278,METHODS: A total of 563 consecutive patients diagnosed with primary SS were evaluated.
2564,278,We retrospectively assessed the results of nerve conduction studies carried out in patients with suspected peripheral nervous system involvement.
2565,278,"Peripheral neuropathies were classified into mononeuropathy, mononeuropathy multiplex, polyneuropathy and neuronopathy according to the patterns evidenced by electrodiagnostic studies."
2566,278,RESULTS: Nerve conduction studies were carried out in 158/563 (28%) SS patients.
2567,278,"The results were normal in 49 and abnormal in 109 patients, in whom peripheral neuropathy was diagnosed in 102."
2568,278,"After excluding patients with neuropathy associated with other diseases and patients with entrapment mononeuropathies, 55/563 (10%) patients were classified as having SS-related peripheral neuropathy, including axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy (n=24), pure sensory neuronopathy (n=15), mononeuropathy multiplex (n=15) and demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (n=1)."
2569,278,"In spite of therapy, clinical progression measured by the MOHS scale was observed in 12% of patients with axonal polyneuropathy, 13% of those with mononeuropathy multiplex and 47% of those with neuronopathy."
2570,278,Survival was significantly reduced in patients with peripheral neuropathy (especially in those with mononeuropathy multiplex and axonal polyneuropathy) in comparison with the control group (log rank =0.001).
2571,278,CONCLUSIONS: We found a prevalence of SS-related peripheral neuropathy of 10%.
2572,278,"Classification of neuropathy according to the clinical presentation and electrodiagnostic tests may be useful in determining the functional outcome, therapeutic response and survival."
2573,279,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic inflammation of exocrine glands such as the lachrymal and salivary glands, leading to xerophthalmia and xerostomia."
2574,279,Neurological manifestations are sometimes found in patients with PSS.
2575,279,"A variety of neurological complications has been reported in patients with PSS, and both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) can be involved in PSS."
2576,279,"Several forms of neuropathy, including polyneuropathy, cranial neuropathy, and multiple mononeuropathy, are often seen in PSS patients."
2577,279,"Herein, we report for the first time typical neuromyotonia (NMT) symptoms appearing in a patient with PSS."
2578,279,"Neuromyotonia is a rare disorder caused by the hyperexcitability of peripheral nerves, causing spontaneous and continuous muscle contraction."
2579,279,"We provide an overview of the literature relating to neurological involvement in PSS, and the etiology of acquired NMT."
2580,279,We also discuss the existence of contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2) antibodies in NMT patients.
2581,280,BACKGROUND: Ocular complications are typical sequels of primary and secondary Sjgren's syndrome.
2582,280,"Since these can lead to blindness in the case of insufficient therapeutic steps, diagnostic tools and therapeutic options in Sjgren-syndrome associated ocular diseases are outlined."
2583,280,METHODS: Literature review from PubMed and own clinical and experimental results.
2584,280,RESULTS: Numerous ocular complications can occur both in primary and secondary Sjgren's syndrome.
2585,280,The main problems involve tear film disturbances leading to severe forms of dry eye.
2586,280,CONCLUSION: Early and close cooperation between rheumatologist and ophthalmologist can avoid long-term complications in patients with Sjgren's disease and ocular complications.
2587,281,"BACKGROUND: Relationships among clinical, physiological, imaging and pathological findings of small airway disease associated with Sjgren's syndrome have remained unclear."
2588,281,SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 14 patients who underwent surgical lung biopsy and who were diagnosed with small airway disease associated with primary or secondary Sjgren's syndrome.
2589,281,"We compared clinical, bronchoalveolar lavage, physiological, imaging and pathological findings between primary and secondary Sjgren's syndrome."
2590,281,"We scored HRCT and pathological abnormalities and investigated correlations among physiological, HRCT and pathological data, changes in physiological parameters and in HRCT scores after two years of treatment, as well as correlations between these values and pathological scores."
2591,281,"RESULTS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, physiological, imaging and pathological findings of the airways did not significantly differ between primary and secondary Sjgren's syndrome."
2592,281,Air trapping on HRCT negatively correlated with MEF50 and MEF25.
2593,281,"Although lymphoid cell infiltration and peribronchiolar fibrosis were the most common pathologies, constrictive change scores correlated negatively with MEF50 and MEF25, positively with air trapping scores and negatively with improvements after therapy in MEF(50), MEF(25) and air trapping."
2594,281,CONCLUSIONS: Constrictive change was the most significant determinant of physiological and imaging presentations and of changes in these factors after therapy for small airway disease associated with Sjgren's syndrome.
2595,282,"Salivary gland changes, characterised by a focal lymphocytic sialadenitits, play an important role in the diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS) and were first described over 40years ago."
2596,282,"Recent evidence suggests that minor salivary gland biopsy may also provide information useful for prognostication and stratification, yet difficulties may arise in the histopathological interpretation and scoring, and evidence exists that reporting is variable."
2597,282,"With the increasing number of actual and proposed clinical trials in PSS, we review the evidence that might support the role of histopathology as a biomarker for stratification and response to therapy and highlight areas where further validation work is required."
2598,283,We report a 53-year-old Turkish female presented with progressive weakness and mild dyspnea.
2599,283,Laboratory results demonstrated severe hypokalemia with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
2600,283,"The urinary anion gap was positive in the presence of acidemia, thus she was diagnosed with hypokalemic paralysis from a severe distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA)."
2601,283,"Immunologic work-up showed a strongly positive ANA of 1:3,200 and positive antibodies to SSA and SSB."
2602,283,Schirmer's test was abnormal.
2603,283,Autoimmune and other tests revealed Sjgren syndrome as the underlying cause of the distal renal tubular acidosis.
2604,283,Renal involvement in Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is not uncommon and may precede sicca complaints.
2605,283,"The pathology in most cases is a tubulointerstitial nephritis causing among other things, distal RTA, and, rarely, hypokalemic paralysis."
2606,283,"Treatment consists of potassium repletion, alkali therapy, and corticosteroids."
2607,283,Primary SS could be a differential in women with acute weakness and hypokalemia.
2608,284,OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on studies examining the properties of ultrasonography of major salivary glands for diagnosing Sjgren's syndrome.
2609,284,MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched for the literature on eight databases.
2610,284,The quality of included articles was assessed with the QUADAS-2 tool.
2611,284,"Publication bias, pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated."
2612,284,Meta-regression analysis was performed.
2613,284,RESULTS: We identified 37 studies and 33 ultrasonographic scoring systems.
2614,284,"High risk of bias was observed in 'patient selection', 'conduct and interpretation of ultrasound', and 'flow of patients and timing of tests' in 78%, 70%, and 51% of the studies."
2615,284,We included 29 studies in the meta-analysis.
2616,284,Publication bias was highly probable.
2617,284,"Pooled sensitivity was 0.69 (95%CI: 0.67-0.71), specificity 0.92 (95%CI: 0.91-0.93), and diagnostic odds ratio 33.89 (95%CI: 20.75-55.35)."
2618,284,Significant heterogeneity was detected between studies.
2619,284,"Meta-regression analysis showed that studies with high risk of bias in 'conduct and interpretation of ultrasound' and studies evaluating only parenchymal homogeneity had higher log diagnostic odds ratio (1.09 and 2.49, respectively, p < 0.05)."
2620,284,"CONCLUSIONS: The quality of current studies is low, thus not allowing to judge the likelihood of salivary gland ultrasonography as a reliable and practical tool in diagnosing Sjgren's syndrome."
2621,285,Sjgren syndrome was chosen as a clinical model to study acinar salivary deficiencies in the development of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).
2622,285,The objective of this prospective cohort study was to compare salivary epidermal growth factor (EGF) concentrations of patients with Sjgren syndrome with and without LPR and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with normal controls.
2623,285,"LPR was diagnosed with positive scores on the Reflux Symptom Index and Reflux and Reflux Finding Score, corroborated by esophagogastroduodenoscopy and/or 24-hour pH-metry."
2624,285,"Salivary EGF concentrations of both unstimulated and mechanically stimulated saliva were established using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the significance level was set at 95%."
2625,285,Twenty-one patients and 19 controls were studied.
2626,285,All patients had LPR and 60% also had GERD.
2627,285,"The mean salivary EGF concentration of unstimulated and stimulated saliva in the control group was 1,751.37 pg/ml and 544.76 pg/ml, respectively."
2628,285,"Unstimulated and stimulated salivary EGF concentrations in the study group were 2,534.65 pg/ml and 920.69 pg/ml, respectively."
2629,285,These differences were not statistically significant.
2630,285,"Body mass index, presence of erosive esophagitis, or severity of hyposalivation did not significantly influence salivary EGF concentrations."
2631,285,LPR and GERD are highly prevalent in patients with Sjgren syndrome.
2632,285,"Unlike previous studies in which significant EGF deficiencies were found in patients with reflux laryngitis and GERD, patients with Sjgren syndrome seem to have reflux caused by a decrease in clearance capacity and not in specific salivary components."
2633,286,OBJECTIVES: The clinical and therapeutic aspects of primary Sjgren syndrome (PSS) in patients with peripheral neuropathy were analyzed and the specifics of individual case studies are discussed.
2634,286,"METHODS: We retrospectively studied six patients (four women, two men; mean age 64.5years) presenting with PSS with peripheral neurological involvement over a five-year period (2008-2012)."
2635,286,"All patients had neurological examinations, including nerve conduction studies, somatosensory evoked potentials, and sural nerve biopsies."
2636,286,"Treatment regimens included corticosteroids, intravenous gammaglobulin, or immunosuppressive treatment."
2637,286,"RESULTS: Peripheral neuropathy was observed in six (7.9%) of 76 patients with SS as the underlying disease; three were cases of multiple mononeuropathy, two cases had sensory ataxic neuropathy, one of which was autonomic neuropathy, and one case was diagnosed as painful sensory neuropathy without sensory ataxia."
2638,286,Four of the six patients were diagnosed with SS after the onset of neurological symptoms.
2639,286,"Individual peripheral neuropathies had distinct neurological, electrophysiological, and pathological characteristics."
2640,286,The effect of steroids and intravenous gammaglobulin differed depending on the case.
2641,286,"CONCLUSIONS: In PSS patients, a precise diagnosis is important, because the therapeutic strategy and response varies depending on the type of neuropathy."
2642,286,"In clinical practice, it is important to consider a diagnosis of SS when patients present with peripheral neuropathy."
2643,287,"Lymphocytic infiltration of different exocrine and non-exocrine epithelia is the pathological hallmark of primary Sjgren's syndrome, whereas involvement of salivary and lachrymal glands with the clinical counterpart of dry eye and dry mouth are the predominant features of the disease, together with fatigue and musculoskeletal pain."
2644,287,"In addition, systemic manifestations, like arthritis, skin vasculitis, peripheral neuropathy, glomerulonephritis, may also be present in a consistent number of patients."
2645,287,"As result, clinical features in SS can be divided into two facets: the benign subjective but disabling manifestations such as dryness, pain and fatigue, and the systemic manifestations."
2646,287,"In the past decades, great efforts have been made to develop valid tools for the assessment of theseboth facets."
2647,287,"Disease specific questionnaires such as Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort (PROFAD) and Sicca Symptom Inventory (SSI) have been proposed for evaluation of patients' symptoms, whereas different composite indexes have been suggested for the assessment of systemic disease activity."
2648,287,"After that, an international project supported by EULAR, emerged to develop consensus disease activity indexes: the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patients Reported Index (ESSPRI), and the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), a systemic activity index to assess systemic manifestations."
2649,287,Both EULAR indexes have been developed in an international collaboration to be consensual.
2650,287,Both indices have now been validated in a large independent international cohort.
2651,287,"They both have been shown to be feasible, valid and reliable instruments."
2652,287,"Also, we have found that thesetwo scores did not correlate, suggesting that these two indexes assess two different disease components that poorly overlap, but were complementary."
2653,287,"The sensitivity to change of both scores has been assessed, they are both able to detect change, however, ESSDAI score, like other systemic score, is more sensitive to change than ESSPRI and other patient scores."
2654,287,"Current work is ongoing to define disease activity levels and clinically important changes for defining significant clinical improvement with the systemic score ESSDAI, and ESSPRI."
2655,287,"We hope that this increased knowledge on the way to assess patients with primary SS, along with the emergence of new targeted therapy, will put a great input in the improvement of conduction of clinical trials in pSS."
2656,288,OBJECTIVE: Constrictive bronchiolitis (CB) is a poorly understood pulmonary manifestation of primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS).
2657,288,We aimed to clarify the presenting clinicoradiologic features and clinical course of pSS-associated CB through a retrospective cohort study.
2658,288,METHODS: We retrospectively identified 11 patients with pSS and CB (defined by mosaic pattern with air trapping on computed tomography) encountered at our institution over 9 years from 2007 to 2015.
2659,288,"Presenting clinical features, laboratory results, radiologic findings, and clinical course were analyzed."
2660,288,"RESULTS: Our patients were mostly women (91%), with a median age 53 years (range, 31-76 years) at the time of pulmonary symptom (dyspnea or cough) onset."
2661,288,Most (64%) were nonsmokers.
2662,288,"Average interval between diagnosis of pSS and the onset of pulmonary symptoms was 4.4 years; in 4 patients (36%), CB was the presenting manifestation of pSS."
2663,288,Chest radiographs were normal (67%) or demonstrated hyperinflation (33%).
2664,288,"Pulmonary function testing demonstrated airflow obstruction in 7 patients (63%), and 2 patients (18%) had an isolated reduction in diffusing capacity, whereas the remaining 2 patients manifested mixed physiology or normal results."
2665,288,Surgical lung biopsy was performed in 2 patients and confirmed the diagnosis of CB in both.
2666,288,"Treatment was variable among our patients included glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide."
2667,288,"Among 6 patients with follow-up computed tomography and pulmonary function, the results remained stable or worsened."
2668,288,CONCLUSIONS: Constrictive bronchiolitis is a rare extraglandular manifestation and can sometimes be the presenting manifestation of pSS.
2669,288,This pulmonary manifestation is associated with an indolent clinical course and does not respond well to immunosuppressive therapy.
2670,289,OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) for diagnosing primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and to suggest modifications of the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) classification criteria.
2671,289,METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a prospective cohort of patients with suspected primary SS that was established between 2006 and 2011.
2672,289,"The echostructure of the bilateral parotid and submandibular glands was graded from 0 to 4, and the gland size was measured; blood flow to the parotid gland was assessed using Doppler waveform analysis."
2673,289,The reference standard was a clinical diagnosis of primary SS as determined by a group of experts blinded to the results of SGUS.
2674,289,"Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to compare the diagnostic value of the 0-4-point echostructure grade for each of the 4 major salivary glands, the sum of the grades for the 4 glands, and the highest grade among the 4 glands."
2675,289,"RESULTS: Of the 158 patients in the study, 78 had a diagnosis of primary SS according to the experts, including 61 patients (78.2%) who met the AECG criteria."
2676,289,Doppler waveform analysis and gland size measurement showed poor diagnostic performance.
2677,289,The results of ROC curve analysis showed that the highest grade among the 4 glands provided the best diagnostic value.
2678,289,The optimal grade cutoff was 2 (62.8% sensitivity and 95.0% specificity).
2679,289,"A weighted score was constructed using scores for the 5 variables selected by logistic regression analysis, as follows: (salivary flow1.5)+(Schirmer's test1.5)+(salivary gland biopsy3)+(SSA/SSB4.5)+(SGUS2)."
2680,289,"According to ROC curve analysis, a score of 5 of 12.5 had 85.7% sensitivity and 94.9% specificity, compared with 77.9% sensitivity and 98.7% specificity for the AECG criteria."
2681,289,The addition of SGUS to the AECG criteria increased sensitivity to 87.0% but did not change specificity.
2682,289,"CONCLUSION: Modifications of the AECG criteria, including the addition of a SGUS score, notably improved diagnostic performance."
2683,290,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of hitherto unknown origin.
2684,290,"The characteristic hallmark of SS is focal lymphocytic infiltration and slow destruction of exocrine glands, such as lacrimal and salivary glands."
2685,290,Sicca symptoms and/or recurrent parotid gland swelling are often accompanied by fatigue.
2686,290,Clinically relevant extraglandular manifestations occur in more than 20% of patients with primary SS.
2687,290,"The development of malignant B cell lymphoma is the most important complication, which affects about 5% of primary SS patients who are at higher risk to develop malignant B cell lymphoma, both when compared with the general population as well as with patients with SS secondary to other systemic autoimmune disorders."
2688,290,"Treatment of sicca symptoms is primarily symptomatic, whereas glucocorticoids, NSAIDs and/or immunosuppressive drugs may be indicated for the treatment of extraglandular manifestations."
2689,290,"New therapeutic strategies, such as B cell targeted therapies, are in clinical testing especially for patients with severe organ manifestations."
2690,291,The objective of this study was to investigate the utilization of ambulatory dental services in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) prior to their diagnosis using a population-based health claim database in Taiwan.
2691,291,"From the Registry of Catastrophic Illness database in the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan, we identified 389 patients who were diagnosed with pSS from 2005 to 2010."
2692,291,"We also obtained 1,945 control subjects frequency-matched on sex, 10-year age interval, and enrollment date from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database."
2693,291,Both groups were retrospectively traced to 1997 to obtain any records of utilization of dental care services that occurred preceding the index date.
2694,291,Patients with pSS had significantly higher utilization of annual ambulatory dental services over an eight-year interval preceding diagnosis.
2695,291,A significantly higher proportion of patients with pSS (95.1 %) had utilized ambulatory dental services over the whole eight-year interval preceding diagnosis compared with the controls (88.8 %) (p < 0.001).
2696,291,"Utilization of ambulatory dental services for dental caries, pulpitis, gingivitis, stomatitis, and periodontitis were significantly greater in patients with pSS over a three-year period prior to diagnosis compared with the controls."
2697,291,"In conclusion, the utilization of ambulatory dental services was significantly increased in patients with pSS preceding its diagnosis."
2698,291,Health professionals can play an important role in the early recognition of pSS by including it in the differential diagnosis for xerostomia-related complaints.
2699,292,AIMS: The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic value of Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imagingin the assessment of salivary gland involvement in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
2700,292,MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty fivepatients with pSS and 25 healthy volunteers were included.
2701,292,"First, echostructures and the thickness of the submandibular andparotid glands were evaluated by B-mode ultrasonography."
2702,292,"Then, ARFI imaging with Virtual Touch Quantification wasperformed."
2703,292,Ten independent shear wave velocity measurements were taken from each gland.
2704,292,"Finally, the mean shear wavevelocity (SWV) values were calculated, and used for further analysis."
2705,292,RESULTS: The mean SWV values of parotid and submandibularglands were significantly higher in the pSS patients than in the healthy control group (p<0.001).
2706,292,"The cut-off of SWVvalues were calculated to be 1.98 m/s for submandibular glands, and 1.93 m/s for parotid glands."
2707,292,"In pSS patients, the meanSWV values of parotid glands were higher than those of the submandibular glands (p<0.001) and no statistically significantrelationships between symptom duration or the degree of xerostomia and mean SWV values of parotid and submandibularglands were found (all p>0.005)."
2708,292,"CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that ARFI imaging may provide a non-invasive, simpleand fast means of assessment of glandular impairment as an alternative test when other salivary gland tests are inconclusive orcannot be performed."
2709,292,ARFI may be a valuable adjunct for the clinical diagnosis of pSS.
2710,293,OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to assess the diagnostic utility of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
2711,293,METHODS: One hundred fifty-seven patients with sicca symptoms and/or salivary gland swelling were included.
2712,293,"Sicca symptoms, Schirmer test, unstimulated whole saliva (UWS), SS-A/B antibodies, and histology were assessed according to American-European Consensus group (AECG) criteria."
2713,293,All patients underwent high-resolution ultrasound and ARFI imaging of the parotid (PG) and submandibular glands (SMG).
2714,293,RESULTS: Seventy patients were classified as having pSS.
2715,293,"The remaining 87 patients suffered from idiopathic sicca (n=24), rheumatoid arthritis (n=12), sarcoidosis (n=9), cutaneous/systemic lupus erythematosus (n=7), scleroderma (n=2), dermatomyositis (n=1), HBV/HCV (n=2), and panarteritis nodosa (n=1), and disorders in 29 patients were classified as not otherwise specified."
2716,293,"ARFI values of the PG were significantly higher in the pSS versus non-pSS groups (2.860.07 m/s vs. 2.150.11 m/s, p<0.0001)."
2717,293,"ARFI imaging demonstrated diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 81 % and 67 %, respectively."
2718,293,"CONCLUSIONS: In addition to histology, ARFI imaging was the most important diagnostic tool for identifying early pSS."
2719,293,KEY POINTS:  Early stages in Sjgren's syndrome become apparent with major salivary gland enlargements.
2720,293,Schirmer and unstimulated whole saliva tests demonstrated insufficient sensitivity/specificity for early-stage diagnosis.
2721,293,Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging is a reliable tool for diagnosing early disease stages.
2722,294,"Sjgren syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by dry mouth and eyes, known as sicca symptoms."
2723,294,"The exact spectrum of neurological involvement, especially of the central nervous system, in childhood Sjgren syndrome has not been well defined."
2724,294,We report a girl who presented with acute febrile brainstem encephalitis.
2725,294,"In retrospect, she had exhibited a preceding history of recurrent conjunctivitis and strong halitosis that could be considered as sicca symptoms."
2726,294,"The histopathology results of a minor salivary biopsy, the presence of anti-SSA/Ro antibody, and keratoconjunctivitis confirmed the diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome."
2727,294,"Commonly observed features in previously reported patients with childhood Sjgren syndrome and central nervous system complications have included fever at the time of neurologic presentation, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, abnormal neuroimaging, and positivity for several specific antibodies."
2728,294,"In children presenting with unknown acute febrile encephalopathy, Sjgren syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis, especially when sicca symptoms are present."
2729,295,PURPOSE: To evaluate light backscattering (LB) in corneal layers in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome dry eye (SSDE) utilizing invivo corneal confocal microscopy (IVCM) and to determine the eventual association with the lacrimal functional test values.
2730,295,"METHODS: A complete ophthalmic evaluation, Schirmer test with and without stimulation, break-up time (BUT) and IVCM were performed on 55 patients affected by SSDE and in an age- and sex-matched cohort of healthy participants (HP)."
2731,295,"Light backscattering, measures as light reflectivity unit (LRU), detected by IVCM at Bowman's membrane (BM) at 50m, at 100m and at 200m deeper than BM was compared in the two groups."
2732,295,The correlations between LB values and lacrimal function results were evaluated.
2733,295,"RESULTS: In patients affected by SSDE, LB was significantly higher (p<0.001) in each corneal layer examined (+146.33 LRU at BM), compared with HP."
2734,295,A good reverse correlation between the light reflectivity measures at BM with Schirmer test with (r=-0.91) and without (r=-0.90) stimulation and BUT (r=-0.88) was found.
2735,295,Correlations were lower in the deeper corneal layers.
2736,295,"CONCLUSION: Even if our results should be confirmed in further studies with a larger population, these findings show that IVCM is a device able to detect alterations in corneal layers in SSDE patients related to the lacrimal function."
2737,295,Light backscattering (LB) could be very useful for clinical diagnosis and management of SSDE.
2738,296,"OBJECTIVE: To improve the understanding of diagnosis and treatment of patients with primary The data of clinical features, laboratory Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) complicated with lymphoma."
2739,296,"METHODS: findings, therapeutic response and follow-up of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome complicated with lymphoma from January 2006 to January 2011 in our single center were retrospectively analyzed."
2740,296,"RESULTS: Totally twelve inpatients with pSS complicated with lymphoma were diagnosed, which accounted for 1.29% of newly-diagnosed lymphoma inpatients during the same period."
2741,296,"The characteristic immunologic changes were hyperimmunoglobulinemia, hypocomplementemia and decrease of CD4 T cell number."
2742,296,"In our study, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was the most common type, and the main pathological subtype was diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)."
2743,296,"Most of the patients were in advanced stages, Ann Arbor stage IIl-IV, at diagnosis."
2744,296,"Extranodal involvement was common, most frequently in the livers and the lungs."
2745,296,All of the patients received combination chemotherapy.
2746,296,"Most of the NHL patients received CHOP/R-CHOP-like regimens, and the Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) patient received AVD regimen."
2747,296,The median follow-up time was 27 months (range 1-56 months).
2748,296,In terms of median survival time and overall survival there were no statistical significant differences between both low C3 and low C4 group and control group (P > 0.05).
2749,296,In terms of median survival time and overall survival there were no statistical significant differences between rituximab treatment group and control group (P > 0.05).
2750,296,CONCLUSION: The patients with pSS complicated with lymphoma were not uncommon clinically.
2751,296,Hypocomplementemia could not be identified as a risk factor for the prognosis of pSS complicated with lymphoma in our study.
2752,296,"Although expected prognosis of these patients was unfavorable, we found that treatment with rituximab combination chemotherapy could not improve the therapeutic effects and survival of patients with pSS complicated with lymphoma."
2753,297,Sjgren syndrome is uncommon in children and occurs most often in association with autoimmune diseases (secondary Sjgren syndrome).
2754,297,We describe the clinical and biological features of a 7-year-old girl with primary Sjgren syndrome revealed by recurrent parotiditis.
2755,297,"CASE REPORT: A 7-year-old girl was referred for investigation of multiple episodes of parotid swelling since age 4 years, without systemic symptoms."
2756,297,The examination was unremarkable except for enlarged and painless parotid glands.
2757,297,Laboratory investigations and labial salivary gland biopsy revealed Sjgren syndrome without associated disease.
2758,297,Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed with clinical improvement.
2759,297,CONCLUSION: Recurrent parotiditis in children is an uncommon condition.
2760,297,"The onset of parotid swelling at 5 years or over deserves screening for disimmune disorders, sarcoidosis, or Sjgren syndrome."
2761,297,Diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome is based on diagnostic criteria.
2762,298,"We report two cases of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) associated with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), comparing the clinical and laboratory features of these predominant neurological patients and reporting their different outcome."
2763,298,"NMO - a severe demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system - primarily affects the spinal cord and optic nerves, resulting in longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and/or optic neuritis."
2764,298,"Our patients had a late pSS diagnosis, due to the absence of sicca syndrome and specific Sjgren serology in the early stages of their diseases, when the neurological symptoms prevailed."
2765,298,"Many NMO patients have an accompanying autoimmune disease, most commonly Sjgren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus or a related profile of non-organ-specific autoantibodies."
2766,298,"Neurologic involvement occurs in approximately 20% of patients with pSS, usually preceding the diagnosis (in 75-80% of the cases) [1,2]."
2767,298,"The frequency of both neurologic manifestations (revealing pSS) and negative autoimmune serology, especially in the event of CNS involvement, could explain why underlying pSS is misdiagnosed [3,4]."
2768,298,"Screening for pSS should be systematically performed in cases of acute or chronic myelopathy and/or cranial nerve involvement, mainly because these patients have a severe outcome."
2769,298,"The presence of the anti-aquaporin4 antibodies, besides anti-Ro and anti-La, in both reported cases, is intriguing and raises the question of whether we are facing two distinct diseases or the NMO is just complicating an unusually less expressive Sjgren's syndrome subtype."
2770,299,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive demyelinating-inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, probably of autoimmune etiology."
2771,299,"Characteristic qualities include multifocal demyelination, which result in varied clinical pictures of the disease."
2772,299,"MS must be differentiated from chronic or recurring diseases, as well as from those with multifocal neurological manifestations and multifocal lesions revealed in a MR scan."
2773,299,"Particular signs may precede the development of the full-blown MS, but they may be initial manifestations of autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome, Behet's disease or Sjgren's syndrome as well."
2774,299,"Diagnosis is easier in the later stages due to appearance of characteristic manifestations, absent in the course of MS."
2775,299,"Nevertheless, the mildly symptomatic nature of those diseases may lead to misdiagnosis, putting the patient at risk of an expensive and inefficient treatment, which may only exacerbate the symptoms."
2776,299,In many cases a long-term follow-up is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
2777,300,OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of SS in a cohort of recent-onset SLE patients and evaluate the clinical and immunological variables that may identify SLE patients prone to develop SS.
2778,300,"METHODS: A total of 103 patients participating in a prospective cohort of recent-onset SLE were assessed for fulfilment of the American European Consensus Group criteria for SS using a three-phase approach: screening (European questionnaire, Schirmer-I test and wafer test), confirmation (fluorescein staining test, non-stimulated whole-salivary flow and anti-Ro/La antibodies) and lip biopsy."
2779,300,Anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies and RF were measured at entry into the cohort and at SS assessment.
2780,300,RESULTS: Ninety-three females and 10 males were included.
2781,300,"Mean age at lupus diagnosis was 25.9  8.9 years, and lupus duration at SS assessment was 30.9  9.1 years."
2782,300,"SS was diagnosed in 19 (18.5%) patients, all female, and the patients were older at SLE diagnosis than patients without SS (30.8  9.3 vs 24  8.8 years, P = 0.004)."
2783,300,"Anti-Ro/SSA antibody was more common in SLE-SS patients (84% vs 55%, P = 0.02, LR + 1.53, 95% CI 1.14, 2.04)."
2784,300,"In the multivariate analysis, age 25 years and anti-Ro/SSA antibodies at SLE diagnosis were identified as predictors of SLE-SS, while the absence of anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB and RF seems to be protective (LR- 0.14, 95% CI 0.02, 0.95)."
2785,300,CONCLUSION: The overlap of SLE and SS occurs in almost one-fifth of SLE patients and presents early during its evolution.
2786,300,"SLE onset at age 25 years plus the presence of anti-Ro/SSA antibody at diagnosis are useful predictors, while the absence of anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB and RF identifies patients at lowest risk."
2787,301,"Salivary gland ultrasonography is a simple, noninvasive and inexpensive procedure, which provides valuable information for the diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
2788,301,"The main sonographic characteristic of the major salivary glands (parotid and submandibular) in pSS patients is the heterogeneity of the parenchyma, with the appearance of hypoechoic areas."
2789,301,Numerous studies published over the past 20 years report a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of more than 90% for the diagnosis of pSS.
2790,301,"Before the widespread use of this procedure in daily practice and its integration into classification criteria of the disease, it has yet to be validated in terms of reproducibility and a consensus score should be established."
2791,301,This work is being conducted by an international group of experts.
2792,301,Other ultrasound techniques such as elastography could also be of interest to objectively quantify changes in the glandular tissue that occur during the disease.
2793,302,Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that causes tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface.
2794,302,The prevalence of dry eye in the world population ranges from 6 to 34 %.
2795,302,"It is more common in those aged over 50, and affects mainly women."
2796,302,"Since the introduction of the Schirmer's test in 1903, other tests have been developed to evaluate dry eye, such as biomicroscopy, the tear film breakup time (BUT), vital dyes (lissamine green and rose bengal), fluorescein, leaf fern test, corneal sensitivity test, conjunctiva impression cytology, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and tear osmolarity measurement."
2797,302,"Although there is no gold standard, it is advisable to combine at least two tests."
2798,302,"Strategies for treating DED have recently been modified and include patient education, tear substitute, corticosteroids, secretagogues, fatty acids, immunomodulators, occlusion of lacrimal puncta surgery and, tarsorrhaphy."
2799,302,"Biological therapy and new topical immunomodulators such as tacrolimus, tofacitinib and IL-1 receptor inhibitor are being tested."
2800,302,"In this review, the evaluation tests for dry eye are compared and the main studies on treatment are presented, with emphasis on studies in patients with Sjgren's syndrome."
2801,302,The authors propose an approach for the management of dry eye.
2802,303,"After presenting with nonspecific symptoms, a 52-year-old female was found to have a 3.4  2.6 cm retroperitoneal mass resulting in hydronephrosis on abdominal computed tomography scan."
2803,303,"After extensive workup including surgical debulking, excisional biopsy, and autoimmune panel, she was found to have idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (IRF) with negative staining for immunoglogulin G4 (IgG4)."
2804,303,"Two years after presentation, the patient developed dyspnea, cough, and xerostomia."
2805,303,Repeat anti-Sjgren Syndrome A and anti-Sjgren Syndrome B titers and labial gland biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of concomitant Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
2806,303,The patient was treated with mycophenolate mofetil with improvement in her symptoms.
2807,303,Most cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis are associated with IgG4-related disease or other autoimmune disease.
2808,303,"To our knowledge, this is only the second reported case of SS associated with IRF."
2809,303,"Because symptoms of IRF are nonspecific, there is often a delay in diagnosis resulting in end-organ disease such as ureteral obstruction or hydronephrosis."
2810,303,"Although IRF is uncommon, it should be considered in patients presenting with abdominal or flank pain, especially in patients with concomitant autoimmune disorders."
2811,303,"Early recognition of disease can prevent end-organ damage and, as more cases are diagnosed, its relationship to SS may be elucidated leading to further advances in treatment and surveillance."
2812,304,"Although central nervous system manifestations seem common in primary Sjgren's syndrome, hypertrophic pachymeningitis is rare."
2813,304,We herein describe a case of Sjgren's syndrome that was associated with hypertrophic pachymeningitis.
2814,304,Sjgren's syndrome should be considered as a cause of hypertrophic pachymeningitis.
2815,305,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in a longitudinal study the influence of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) on lung function in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
2816,305,METHODS: Lung function was studied over an eight-year period in 15 patients who fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria for primary Sjgren's syndrome and who were covered in our earlier published study on AHR in patients with Sjgren's syndrome.
2817,305,"Standard spirometry and measurements of lung volumes, diffusing capacity (DLCO), and AHR to methacholine were performed."
2818,305,"RESULTS: A significant decline over time was found in total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and expiratory midflows (FEF(50))."
2819,305,"A sign of small airway obstruction (decrease in FEF(50)) at entry correlated with VC at follow-up (r=.8,P<.003), and the individual change in FEF(50) during the observation period correlated with the individual change in VC (r=.6, P<.05)."
2820,305,"Six patients had increased AHR, and three of them had decreased DLCO."
2821,305,"Six of the patients progressively reduced DLCO over time, and five of them had spirometric signs of increased small airway obstruction."
2822,305,CONCLUSIONS: During this eight-year follow-up we observed that one-third of the patients with pSS developed a significant reduction in lung function.
2823,305,Our findings suggest that small airways obstruction and AHR are associated with reduction of VC and development of impaired DLCO as a sign of interstitial lung disease in this group of patients.
2824,306,"The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence, predictors and radiological findings of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)-associated lung involvement."
2825,306,"This retrospective cohort study included 123 patients with demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data who were diagnosed with pSS."
2826,306,Lung involvement was defined based on the presence of pulmonary signs/symptoms and/or impaired pulmonary function tests along with alterations in high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT).
2827,306,Thirty patients (24.4%) had pulmonary signs/symptoms at the initial presentation and/or during the follow-up period.
2828,306,"Based on the criteria, 14 patients (11.4%) were defined as having pSS with lung involvement."
2829,306,"The smoking rate, male/female ratio and the mean ages were found to be higher in patients with lung involvement (P < 0.05)."
2830,306,"Positive IgM-rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-La and anti-Ro results, the presence of hypergammaglobulinemia and lymphopenia had high specificity despite the low sensitivity rates to detect pSS-associated lung disease."
2831,306,A significant difference was found in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) results between the patients with and without lung involvement.
2832,306,"Impaired FEV(1) had high specificity and positive predictive value compared to impaired FVC, particularly in non-smoker patients."
2833,306,The most frequent HRCT finding was ground-glass attenuation (64.3%).
2834,306,"Other common findings were bronchiectasis, reticular pattern and honeycombing."
2835,306,The lesions involved predominantly the lower lobes.
2836,306,"In conclusion, the presence of hypergammaglobulinemia and lymphopenia, positivity for RF, anti-La and anti-Ro, and impaired (FVC) and/or FEV(1) values could be the predictive parameters with a high specificity despite the low sensitivity rates."
2837,306,"Smoking history, male gender and age are also risk factors."
2838,306,These parameters may be helpful to distinguish pSS-associated lung involvement from lung disorders unrelated to pSS.
2839,307,"AIM: To investigate whether patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) can be distinguished based on the positivity of anti-centromere antibody (ACA), and if so, whether the subgroups differ in their clinical and laboratory features."
2840,307,METHODS: Eleven patients with ACA-positive and 71 patients ACA-negative SS were examined.
2841,307,"All patients had minor salivary gland biopsy; sociodemographic data, glandular and extraglandular manifestations, and laboratory findings, including autoantibodies, complement and immunoglobulin levels, were analyzed."
2842,307,European League Against Rheumatism SS disease activity index (ESSDAI) and SS disease damage index (SSDDI) were also measured.
2843,307,RESULTS: The prevalence of ACA among SS patients was 13.4%.
2844,307,"ACA-positive SS patients had a higher prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon, sclerodactyly and autoimmune thyroiditis and a lower prevalence of anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies compared to ACA-negative patients."
2845,307,"Disease activity was higher in ACA-positive patients than in ACA-negative patients, but the damage index did not differ between the two groups."
2846,307,None of the patients who originally had ACA evolved to having full-blown systemic sclerosis.
2847,307,CONCLUSION: Patients with SS who have ACA differ from classic SS patients in several clinical and laboratory parameters.
2848,307,ACA should be considered one of the pathogenically relevant autoantibodies for SS.
2849,308,"Between August 2009 and May 2016, 74 patients underwent sialoendoscopic surgery."
2850,308,32 patients had parotid gland disease and 9 patients had intermittent swelling of the parotid gland and sialoliths were not detected with CT imaging.
2851,308,4 patients were diagnosed with idiopathic Stensen's duct stenosis.
2852,308,Sialendoscopy directly confirmed Stensen's duct stenosis in 2 patients.
2853,308,"However, the sialendoscope was unable to be inserted in the other 2 patients, who had stenosis of the orifice of the Stensen's duct."
2854,308,Balloon expansion of the duct was performed in these 2 patients and a steroid drug was injected into the duct in one patient.
2855,308,Complete remission was archived in one patient treated with sialendoscopy.
2856,308,Three patients had sialolithiasis.
2857,308,Microsialoliths and/or white floating matter was observed and removed using sialendoscopy.
2858,308,All patients experienced complete remission.
2859,308,"In cases of Sjgren syndrome and recurrent parotitis, sialendoscopic surgery was performed, but the symptoms showed no improvement."
2860,308,"For patients with microsialoliths, sialendoscopy may be most useful for diagnosis and treatment when the sialoliths are not detected with CT imaging."
2861,308,"At present, sialendoscopic surgery have limitation in the treatment of Stensen's duct stenosis and may similarly have limitation in the treatment of Sjgren's syndrome and recurrent parotitis."
2862,309,The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging as a monitoring tool for the effect of a liposomal local therapy in patients with dry mouth symptoms due to primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
2863,309,"Fifty patients with pSS, diagnosed according to the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria, were included."
2864,309,"Clinical data were collected, and sonographic examination including ARFI imaging of the parotid and submandibular glands was performed."
2865,309,"Subjective symptoms were evaluated via visual analogue scales (VAS), and the unstimulated whole salivary flow was measured."
2866,309,"After a two-month period of liposomal local therapy, sonographic examination was repeated and both subjective and objective symptoms were re-evaluated."
2867,309,"Before local treatment, the mean ARFI value of parotid glands was 2.96m/s (SD 0.97)."
2868,309,Mean ARFI value of the submandibular glands was 2.09m/s (SD 0.71).
2869,309,"After the two-month treatment period, a significant decline of ARFI values in the parotid glands to a value of 2.34m/s (SD 0.70, p<0.001) could be observed."
2870,309,The submandibular glands did not show any significant change.
2871,309,"Further, a significant reduction of the subjective sensation of dry mouth symptoms could be observed (p=0.0001)."
2872,309,"With the application of ARFI imaging, a decline in parotid gland stiffness could be observed in patients with primary Sjgren's Syndrome accompanied by a significant improvement of the subjective sensation of dry mouth symptoms."
2873,309,The seromucous submandibular glands did not show any changes compared to the serous parotid glands.
2874,310,"Sjgrens syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by a reduced function of exocrine glands, mainly salivary and lacrimal glands based on chronic plasmocellular infiltration."
2875,310,"Syndrome includes affection of glands in gastrointestinal system, respiratory apparatus, skin, and vaginal mucosa."
2876,310,I tis described separately as a primary Sjgrens syndrome or together with other inflammatory rheumatic diseases as a secondary Sjgrens syndrome.
2877,310,Advanced diagnostic is based mainly on serologic examinations.
2878,310,Treatment of patients reflects the form of Sjgrens syndrome.
2879,310,Despite recent knowledge the treatment is rather symptomatic than causal (Ref.
2880,310,12).
2881,311,BACKGROUND: Lung involvement is one of the major systemic manifestations of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
2882,311,"This study aims to demonstrate the correlation between high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), pulmonary function test (PFT) results, and outcome in these patients."
2883,311,METHODS: Forty-four pSS patients were enrolled and their PFT results and HRCT findings/scores were retrospectively investigated.
2884,311,"RESULTS: All patients had reduced carbon monoxide-diffusing capacity (DLCO; <75% of the predicted value); <60% of the predicted value of peak expiratory flow (PEF), of forced vital capacity (FVC), and of forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (FEV1) were noted in 15 (34.1%) patients, 13 (29.5%) patients, and 12 (27.3%) patients, respectively."
2885,311,"HRCT scores had a negative correlation with DLCO (r = -0.376, p = 0.012), but not with other PFT results."
2886,311,"Twelve patients (27.3%) expired during a mean follow-up of 3.7 years; 11 (91.7%) patients died of respiratory failure in the lung-involved patients, of which three were present with pneumonia."
2887,311,"The expired patients had lower predicted values of FEV1 (63.1  19.4% vs. 79.0  22.7%, p = 0.017), FVC (58.7  20.4% vs. 77.1  17.5%, p = 0.005), and PEF (54.3  20.5% vs. 72.0  24.8%, p = 0.035), and higher HRCT scores (9.2  5.7 vs. 5.2  3.5, p = 0.033) than those patients who survived."
2888,311,"Patients with FEV1, FVC, PEF < 60% of the predicted value, or high HRCT score (13-18) presented shorter median overall survival (p = 0.005, p < 0.001, p = 0.021, p < 0.001, respectively)."
2889,311,Multivariate analysis adjusted for PFT results showed that HRCT 13 was an independent risk factor for mortality (p = 0.007).
2890,311,CONCLUSION: The clinical outcome of pSS patients with lung involvement in Taiwan is not very favorable.
2891,311,"Although HRCT score was poorly correlated with PFT, high HRCT score was significantly associated with higher mortality."
2892,312,"OBJECTIVES: Besides ocular and oral dryness, fatigue is a major symptom in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
2893,312,Our aim was to investigate the importance of fatigue in relation to other symptoms experienced as well as to evaluate the effect of rituximab treatment on fatigue in pSS patients with active disease.
2894,312,METHODS: This analysis was based on data from our open-label rituximab study in 28 pSS patients.
2895,312,"Symptoms of dryness, physical fatigue, pain, and mental fatigue were scored on 0-10 scales (according to ESSPRI)."
2896,312,Systemic disease activity was assessed with ESSDAI.
2897,312,"RESULTS: At baseline, 24 (86%) patients rated physical fatigue as the complaint most eligible for improvement (median importance of 10), followed by pain, dryness, and mental fatigue."
2898,312,"After rituximab treatment, physical fatigue showed maximum improvement of 2.5 points and 31% in median values at group level, and 10 (36%) patients reached physical fatigue score<5 representing patient-acceptable symptom state (PASS)."
2899,312,"In comparison, systemic disease activity improved 5.5 points and 73% at group level, and 22 (79%) patients reached ESSDAI<5 representing low disease activity."
2900,312,"GEE analysis over time revealed that physical fatigue was significantly associated with absolute number of B cells, dryness and mental fatigue, but not with ESSDAI, IgG levels and IgM-RF."
2901,312,CONCLUSIONS: Physical fatigue characterises patient experience of pSS.
2902,312,Rituximab treatment resulted in significant improvement of patient-reported symptoms.
2903,312,"However, the large majority of patients still experienced physical fatigue at an unsatisfactory level, above the cut-off value for PASS."
2904,312,"Therefore, attention for optimal management of this prominent symptom is warranted."
2905,313,"This article presents a case of a 29-year-old pregnant woman with Sjgren's syndrome, regardless of her first pregnancy loss, conceived and delivered a healthy baby."
2906,313,The authors have also reviewed available medical literature and have indicated problems that typically occur in such patients.
2907,313,"Diagnostic methods, therapeutic possibilities, and common complications that obstetrician have to deal with while taking care of pregnant women with Sjgren's syndrome have been shown."
2908,314,Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is common in adults with primary Sjogren syndrome (pSS) but to date this condition has only been identified in 12 pediatric cases of pSS.
2909,314,"Here we present the case of a 13-year-old, otherwise asymptomatic girl in whom the search for the etiology of incidentally found nephrocalcinosis led to diagnosis of distal RTA and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus secondary to SS-associated tubulointerstitial nephritis."
2910,314,Immunosupressive treatment and alkali/electrolyte supplementation resulted in stable renal function over the 6-year follow-up.
2911,314,"A review of the literature focuses on two aspects of pSS: (1) the difficulties in diagnosing pSS in childhood and (2) clinical-pathological features, treatment and outcome of renal tubulointerstitial disease in childhood pSS."
2912,314,"SS should be considered in older children, particularly females with otherwise unexplained RTA."
2913,314,"A careful search for other renal dysfunctions is necessary, and renal biopsy may be of value in assessing the extent of renal damage and the need for immunomodulatory therapy."
2914,315,OBJECTIVE: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a common chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the salivary and lacrimal glands.
2915,315,Arterial stiffness is one of the earliest detectable manifestations of adverse structural and functional changes within the vessel wall.
2916,315,The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between arterial stiffness and pSS.
2917,315,"METHODS: In this study, 75 female patients with pSS who fulfilled the American European Consensus Criteria for Sjgren's syndrome, were included."
2918,315,"A total of 68 age-, sex- and body mass index-matched subjects were recruited as the control population."
2919,315,Arterial stiffness was assessed by measurement of the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV).
2920,315,RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 54.09.3 years and the median duration of the disease was 10 years.
2921,315,"Compared with the control subjects, patients with pSS had a higher mean PWV (8.21.5 m/s vs. 7.51.4 m/s; p=0.01)."
2922,315,"Correlation analysis showed that the PWV was positively correlated with age, body mass index, serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and C-reactive protein levels, blood pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse pressure and left ventricular mass index."
2923,315,"A multiple linear regression analysis revealed that arterial stiffness was associated with age, MAP and LDL levels in pSS patients."
2924,315,"CONCLUSION: Although patients with pSS appear to have increased arterial stiffness, risk factors associated with arterial stiffness in these patients are similar to the general population."
2925,315,"However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a higher PWV in pSS patients is caused, not by pSS itself, but by the use of steroids, hypertension and dyslipidemia."
2926,316,BACKGROUND: Sjgren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterised by exocrinopathy mainly involving the salivary and lacrimal glands.
2927,316,"In addition, it is a multisystemic condition (i.e., affecting multiple organs and systems)."
2928,316,"Neurological involvement has been reported in ~20% of cases, with peripheral manifestations being the most frequent."
2929,316,METHODS: We analysed four cases in which neurological manifestations were the first symptoms of Sjgren's syndrome.
2930,316,"RESULTS: In all four cases, neurological symptoms preceded sicca symptoms."
2931,316,"In addition, immunosuppressive treatment with steroids and, in some cases, cyclophosphamide showed improvement."
2932,316,CONCLUSION: Neurological involvement in Sjgren's syndrome is common and often occurs as the first clinical manifestation.
2933,316,"Since evidence is limited, more studies are required in order to determine appropriate diagnostic methods and treatments for each manifestation of Sjgren's syndrome."
2934,317,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a rheumatic disease characterised by musculoskeletal pain, chronic diffuse tension and/or stiffness in joints and muscles, fatigue, sleep and emotional disturbances and pressure pain sensitivity in at least 11 of 18 tender points."
2935,317,"There are currently no instrumental tests or specific diagnostic markers, and the characteristic symptoms of the disease overlap those of many other conditions classified in a different manner."
2936,317,"FM is often associated with other diseases that act as confounding and aggravating factors, including primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)."
2937,317,"It has been reported to coexist in 25% of patients with RA, 30% of patients with SLE and 50% of patients with pSS."
2938,317,"Its clinical diagnosis is not easy because FM-like symptoms are frequent, and its differential diagnosis with other causes of chronic diffuse pain is difficult."
2939,317,"This is even more true in the case of patients who are positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) because, although sensitive, ANA positivity is not specific for SLE or connective tissue diseases, and can also be found in 10-15% of FM patients."
2940,317,"Furthermore, composite indices such as the disease activity score (DAS)-28, which are widely used in everyday clinical practice and clinical trials, may be insufficient to evaluate real inflammatory activity in patients with RA associated with chronic pain syndromes such as FM, and can lead to an overestimate of disease activity in RA."
2941,317,"The presence of diffuse pain in autoimmune rheumatic diseases compromises the quality of life of the patients, although overall mortality is not increased."
2942,317,A misdiagnosis harms the patients and the community.
2943,317,"Rheumatologists should be able to recognise and distinguish primary and secondary FM, and need new guidelines and instruments to avoid making mistakes."
2944,318,"Primary Sjogrn's syndrome (pSS) could be restricted in 50% of the cases to glandular involvement with a chronic sicca syndrome, with a considerable alteration of quality of life."
2945,318,"It could be complicated by systemic involvements, which are responsible of the visceral severity."
2946,318,Thus systemic complications could appear many years after initial pSS diagnosis and justify long-term surveillance.
2947,318,"Initial parotid gland enlargement, Raynaud phenomenon, cutaneous vasculitis and immunological abnormalities (anti-SSA and/or SSB positivity, hypergammaglobulinemia, and cryoglobulinemia) are also implicated in systemic complications."
2948,319,OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic value of minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) for primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
2949,319,"METHODS: Systematic review of studies retrieved from PUBMED and EMBASE using the terms 'salivary glands' AND 'Sjgren's syndrome' AND 'biopsy', conducted in patients with suspected pSS, and defining positive biopsies as a focus score (FS)1."
2950,319,Sensitivity and specificity of MSGB were abstracted from the articles or calculated when possible.
2951,319,"RESULTS: Of 238 publications identified initially, 9 were included in the study."
2952,319,MSGB sensitivity ranged from 63.5% to 93.7% and specificity from 61.2% to 100%.
2953,319,Specificity was >89% in six studies.
2954,319,"An attempt to separate patients with and without pSS without using MSGB findings or via clinical re-evaluation was made in only two studies, in 73 and 120 patients, respectively, with sicca syndrome in the first study and suspected pSS in the other."
2955,319,The reference standard for diagnosing pSS was a set of criteria that did not include MSGB in the first and patient re-evaluation by three experienced rheumatologists who were aware of MSGB findings in the other.
2956,319,"In these studies, sensitivity was 63.9% and 85.7% and specificity was 91.9% and 89.7%, respectively."
2957,319,CONCLUSIONS: Few published studies have evaluated the diagnostic usefulness of MSGB in pSS.
2958,319,Only two studies used a methodology that precluded circular reasoning.
2959,319,Our study indicates a lack of information about the diagnostic value of MSGB.
2960,319,Specificity and positive predictive values (PPV) are high and sensitivity is variable.
2961,320,"A decreased saliva production occurs in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), an autoimmune disease characterized by oral and ocular dryness due to dysfunction of the lacrimal and salivary glands (SGs)."
2962,320,"Since water movement is involved in saliva secretion, the expression, localization, and function of the water channels aquaporins (AQPs) have been extensively studied in SGs."
2963,320,"To date, the presence of AQP4 remains controversial and ambiguous in human SGs."
2964,320,"We investigated by immunohistochemistry, high-resolution confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis, Western blot and real-time RT-PCR, the presence of the AQP4 gene, and the distribution of AQP4 protein in healthy controls and pSS SG biopsies."
2965,320,"Through the immunohistochemical analysis, we demonstrated that AQP4 presence is confined to the basal region of acini, to the lateral and apical membrane of intercalated and striated ducts in both control and pSS glands."
2966,320,"The most striking observation was the discovery of AQP4 localization in myoepithelial cells (MECs) that surround acini lobules and intercalated ducts, and the demonstration of AQP4-downregulated immunoreactivity in pSS MECs."
2967,320,"Our studies suggest that the capacity for water flow across the membrane of MECs may be altered in pSS, identifying AQP4 as a promising new therapeutic agent to treat xerostomia."
2968,321,INTRODUCTION: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the lacrimal and salivary exocrine glands.
2969,321,"In children, it is a rare condition."
2970,321,"OBJECTIVE: To present the case of an adolescent with non-specific symptoms, but with a clinical suspicion of SS."
2971,321,"CASE REPORT: A male 12-year old patient, with history of arthralgias for 3 years and suspicion of xerophthalmia."
2972,321,"Physical examination showed mild conjunctival congestion, dry mouth and hypermobility of the knees."
2973,321,"Laboratory work: blood count and ESR were normal, antinuclear antibodies (+) > 60, Ro (+) > 60 U, and rheumatoid factor concentration (+) 160 IU / ml."
2974,321,"SS was suspected, and a study was carried out: Schirmer test determined mild dry eye, salivary gland scintigraphy showed parotid and submandibular gland dysfunction, and salivary gland biopsy reported focal lymphocytic acinar and periductal infiltration."
2975,321,"SS was confirmed and treated with prednisone 7.5mg/day and hydroxychloroquine 200mg/day, and local treatment, with good response."
2976,321,"CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic criteria for SS in adults identified only 39% of pediatric patients, due to the low frequency of sicca symptoms."
2977,321,Still there are no validated diagnostic criteria for children.
2978,321,"A good diagnosis will alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and detect associated diseases."
2979,322,To evaluate in a cohort of 100 consecutive patients affected by primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) the incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) and to compare the clinical features and the laboratory parameters of patients affected by pSS with and without concomitant HT.
2980,322,"In 100 consecutive patients affected by pSS, the occurrence of other autoimmune diseases was recorded and a full examination of thyroid function obtained."
2981,322,HT was associated with pSS in 27 cases.
2982,322,"The comparison between pSS cases with and without HT showed that only patients with isolated pSS had low C4 level [p = 0.032, OR (IC 95 %) 230 (13.13-4,046)]."
2983,322,"In addition, only patients affected by pSS without HT had evidence of cryoglobulins, cutaneous vasculitis with palpable purpura, peripheral neuropathy, and development of lymphoma, although all these manifestations were observed in a 4.1-8.2 % of the cases, without reaching statistical significance."
2984,322,The association of HT in patients suffering from pSS defines a subset of patients with milder disease and normal C4 levels.
2985,323,"Many important clinical questions concerning primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) remain, that can only be adequately addressed by prospective cohorts."
2986,323,"Thus, a better knowledge of the clinical outcome, the course of disease activity and the risk factors of lymphoma requires the setting up of cohorts with biobanks."
2987,323,"The homogeneous collection of clinical data, disease activity, patient-related outcome, and biological samples, including DNA, RNA and serum, is definitively mandatory to determine new biological prognostic factors and identify disease activity markers."
2988,323,Three large prospective cohorts have already started to enroll patients with pSS.
2989,323,"This will be highly invaluable for scientists and clinicians to gain a better insight into the pathogenesis of pSS, as well as to identify prognostic markers and new therapeutic targets."
2990,324,Lymphoma is a common disease of the head and neck.
2991,324,Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma constitutes a rare type of extranodal lymphoma.
2992,324,"The Waldeyer's ring is one of the most common sites of occurrence, but MALT lymphoma may also arise in salivary glands, lung, stomach, or lacrimal glands."
2993,324,"In the oral cavity, it may be confused with swellings from dental infection or sinus inflammation."
2994,324,"Often, the patient will seek a dentist because of mobile teeth or because a denture no longer fits."
2995,324,"We report a case of a female patient with salivary gland dysfunction and pain of several years' duration, who, after numerous tests and hospitalizations, was diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome."
2996,324,She later developed mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.
2997,324,"We discuss the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of this entity."
2998,324,MALT lymphoma is rare in salivary glands.
2999,324,"In primary-Sjgren's syndrome, predisposition of the patient for development of malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (4% to 10%) is well established."
3000,324,"In this case, long-standing sialadenitis and Sjgren's syndrome seem to be the etiological factors."
3001,324,"In cases of chronic infection of salivary glands and the presence of autoimmune syndromes, MALT lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis."
3002,324,"Consults should be called to ophthalmology, rheumatology, and head and neck oncologists for proper workup, staging, and treatment."
3003,325,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper was to study the evolution of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) immunological profile, its impact on pSS activity and long-term evolution in a bicentric cohort of French patients with pSS (n = 445, mean age 53.6  14 years, mean follow-up 76.1  51 months)."
3004,325,METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study.
3005,325,"RESULTS: Two hundred twelve patients were Sjgren's syndrome A (SSA) positive, and 131 were both SSA and Sjgren's syndrome B (SSB) positive."
3006,325,Sixty-eight patients (15%) had cryoglobulinemia.
3007,325,"Active systemic profile (i.e., hypergammaglobulinemia, rheumatoid factor (RF), and anti-Sjgren's syndrome A (anti-SSA), anti-Sjgren's syndrome B (anti-SSB) positivity), associated with multisystemic involvement, leads to an increased utilization of corticosteroid and hydroxychloroquine."
3008,325,"Multivariate analysis pointed out independent statistical association between hypergammaglobulinemia, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, and RF."
3009,325,"Cryoglobulinemia is associated with multi-systemic involvement, lymphoma, and pSS-related death."
3010,325,CONCLUSION: The subset of patients with active immunological profile is characterized by systemic complications leading to immunosuppressive drug utilization and polyclonal B-cell activation profile.
3011,326,BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren syndrome is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease.
3012,326,"The delay in diagnosis allows the establishment of a chronic inflammatory state, which makes primary Sjgren syndrome an interesting model for the study of atherosclerosis."
3013,326,OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate subclinical atherosclerosis in 49 patients with Sjgren syndrome using noninvasive methods.
3014,326,"METHODS: We assessed traditional risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, and family history of atherosclerosis."
3015,326,Patients with prior cardiovascular events and a history of atherosclerosis were excluded.
3016,326,"Clinical and laboratory features were recorded, as well as the European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's Syndrome Activity Index calculation."
3017,326,"The atherosclerosis evaluation was done by carotid intima-media thickness, measured by ultrasonography, and ankle-brachial index (ABI)."
3018,326,"RESULTS: Fifteen patients (31%) had at least 1 traditional risk factor, and 65.3% had a European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's Syndrome Activity Index score from mild to moderate."
3019,326,Only 2 patients had increased carotid intima-media thickness.
3020,326,"However, 59% presented ABI alterations."
3021,326,"Multiple correspondence analysis showed a clear correlation between low ABI and the positivity of autoantibodies (antinuclear antibodies, anti-SSA, rheumatoid factor)."
3022,326,"CONCLUSIONS: The subgroup of patients with positive autoantibodies showed low ABI, which may represent a higher risk of early atherosclerosis and indicate the need for more careful monitoring in this group."
3023,327,"The aim of this case-control study is to evaluate the cerebral hemodynamic parameters in primary Sjgren syndrome patients by means of transcranial Doppler and the possible relationship with neuroimaging structural alteration, immunological markers and subclinical neurological involvement."
3024,327,"87 consecutive treatment-nave outpatients with primary Sjgren syndrome and 86 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent transcranial Doppler for bilateral measurement of mean flow velocities, pulsatility index and systolic-diastolic ratio, brain magnetic resonance imaging, clinical evaluation with neuropsychological test and serological assessment."
3025,327,"28 patients and 4 controls (32 vs. 4 %, p .001) had executive function disorders at neuropsychological tests."
3026,327,"Mean pulsatility index and systolic-diastolic ratio were significantly higher in both mean cerebral arteries of the patients than in controls (1.3  0.6 vs. 0.9  0.6, p .01 and 3.4  1.7 vs. 1.6  0.7, p .001, respectively)."
3027,327,White matter hyperintensities were present in 21 patients and 18 controls.
3028,327,Only age was significantly associated with WMHs in both groups (p < .0001).
3029,327,The increase in systolic-diastolic ratio significantly correlates with neuropsychological impairment.
3030,327,Anti-SSA autoantibodies positively correlate with impaired systolic-diastolic ratio and with neuropsychiatric symptoms.
3031,327,The correlation between haemodynamic changes and anti-SSA autoantibodies suggests a role for the autoimmune response in determining early cerebral hemodynamic dysfunctions.
3032,327,The functional impairment of the endothelium may play a pivotal role in vasomotor dysfunction before any organic damage.
3033,327,The subsequent structural damage of the arterial wall may be responsible for the increase in resistances in small cerebral arteries and sustained hypoperfusion.
3034,328,"The background of this study is to assess the accuracy of lung ultrasound (LUS) to diagnose interstitial lung disease (ILD) in Sjgren's syndrome (Sjs), in patients who have any alterations in pulmonary function tests (PFT) or respiratory symptoms."
3035,328,"LUS was correlated with chest tomography (hrCT), considering it as the imaging gold standard technique to diagnose ILD."
3036,328,"This is a pilot, multicenter, cross-sectional, and consecutive-case study."
3037,328,"The inclusion criteria are 18years old, Signs and symptoms: according to ACEG 2002 criteria, respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough), or any alterations in PFR."
3038,328,LUS was done following the International Consensus Conference on Lung Ultrasound protocol for interstitial syndrome (B pattern).
3039,328,"Of the 50 patients in follow-up, 13 (26%) met the inclusion criteria."
3040,328,All were women with age 63.62years (range 39-88).
3041,328,"78.6% of the cases had primary Sjs (SLE, RA, n=2)."
3042,328,"The intra-rater reliability k is 1, according to Gwet's Ac1 and GI index (probability to concordance-e(K)-, by Cohen, of 0.52)."
3043,328,"LUS has a sensitivity of 1 (95% CI 0.398-1.0), specificity of 0.89 (95% CI 0.518-0.997), and a positive probability reason of 9.00 (95% CI 7.1-11.3) to detect ILD."
3044,328,The correlation of Pearson is r=0.84 (p<0.001).
3045,328,"To check the accuracy of LUS to diagnose ILD, a completely bilateral criterion of yes/no for interstitial pattern was chosen, AUC reaches significance, 0.94 (0.07) (95% CI 0.81-1.0, p=0.014)."
3046,328,"LUS reaches an excellent correlation to hrCT in Sjs affected with ILD, and might be a useful technique in daily clinical practice for the assessment of pulmonary disease in the sicca syndrome."
3047,329,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease uncommon in children, clinically characterized by recurrent parotitis at the onset, which is a common disorder in childhood, most of them of infectious origin."
3048,329,"Juvenile pSS diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms and presence of autoantibodies, after exclusion of infectious or lymphoproliferative diseases."
3049,329,"However, salivary gland ultrasound (SGU) shows typical features of pSS that can add useful information for the diagnosis of this disorder."
3050,329,We describe three patients who presented with recurrent parotitis in which characteristic autoantibodies and typical SGU pattern allow us to make the diagnosis of juvenile pSS.
3051,329,We suggest that in children with recurrent parotitis SGU and autoantibodies should be routinely performed.
3052,330,PURPOSE: To explore the role of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) of parotid glands in diagnosing Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
3053,330,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 patients with SS and 40 healthy volunteers underwent 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including DKI, which generated the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), corrected diffusion (D), and diffusional kurtosis (K) values."
3054,330,The MR nodular grade was determined on the basis of MR morphological findings.
3055,330,"RESULTS: The parotid ADC, D, and K values in patients with SS were significantly higher than those of healthy volunteers (P=0.011, < 0.001, 0.022, respectively)."
3056,330,The parotid ADC and D values in patients with SS of MR nodular grade 0 were significantly higher than those of healthy volunteers (all P < 0.001).
3057,330,"The parotid D value showed an accuracy of 75.0% and 87.9% in diagnosing patients with SS and MR nodular grade 0, respectively."
3058,330,"The parotid ADC and D values correlated negatively, while the K values correlated positively with the MR nodular grade significantly in patients with SS (r=-0.741, -0.605, 0.424, all P < 0.001)."
3059,330,All parotid DKI parameters differed significantly among patients with SS at different MR nodular grades (all P < 0.001).
3060,330,"CONCLUSION: Parotid DKI parameters hold great potential in diagnosing SS, especially in early-stage SS without MR morphological changes."

3064,331,BACKGROUND Sjgren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder caused by the infiltration of monocytes in epithelial glandular and extra-glandular tissues.
3065,331,Hallmark presentations include mouth and eye dryness.
3066,331,"Although renal involvement is uncommon in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), patients may experience renal tubular acidosis type I (RTA I), tubulointerstitial nephritis, diabetes insipidus (DI), nephrolithiasis, and Fanconi syndrome."
3067,331,"However, it is atypical to see more than 1 of these manifestations in a single patient."
3068,331,"CASE REPORT We present the case of a 24-year-old woman with polyuria and polydipsia, who was initially diagnosed with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus."
3069,331,She also had chronic hypokalemia and nephrolithiasis.
3070,331,"Based on clinical presentation and work up, she was diagnosed with pSS and treated accordingly."
3071,331,"CONCLUSIONS This was a pSS patient with tubulointerstitial nephritis, diabetes insipidus, renal tubular acidosis, hypokalemia, and nephrolithiasis, who was receiving symptomatic treatment for diabetes insipidus."
3072,331,Diagnosis and treatment of pSS led to significant improvement in systemic and renal presentations of the patient.
3073,331,pSS should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses in patients with diabetes insipidus and renal tubular acidosis.
3074,332,"The association of inflammatory involvement of the distal airways or bronchiolitis and systemic diseases is essentially observed in Sjgren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic inflammatory bowel disease."
3075,332,"Bronchiolitis may be mainly cellular in nature, often involving lympho-monocytic cells, and sometimes associated with lymphoid follicles, as in Sjgren's syndrome."
3076,332,"It may also, particularly in rheumatoid arthritis, be constrictive, with peribronchiolar fibrosis."
3077,332,"This type is associated with a worse prognosis, with possible progression to chronic respiratory insufficiency."
3078,332,"The diagnosis of bronchiolitis should be suspected in any atypical form of asthma, or recurrent ""bronchitis"", and it is essential to look for extrarespiratory symptoms and auto-antibodies to establish the diagnose of systemic disease."
3079,332,The CT appearances coupled with the evaluation of pulmonary function parameters usually lead to the diagnosis.
3080,332,"In severe and/or rapidly progressive cases treatment-combining corticosteroids with immunosuppressive drugs may be prescribed, but often with disappointing results."
3081,332,"In these cases, lung transplantation should be considered in young patients."
3082,333,"This study aimed to characterize the manifestations of clinical symptoms and signs, primary rheumatic diseases, and other autoantibodies in pediatric patients with positive anti-SSA and/or anti-SSB antibodies."
3083,333,Subjects under age 18 with positive anti-SSA and/or anti-SSB antibodies were screened and enrolled in a tertiary hospital in Taiwan.
3084,333,"Data were collected via medical records,including age, gender, onset of the primary rheumatic disease, clinical symptoms and signs, and the medication used."
3085,333,Schirmer test for Sjgren's syndrome (SS) screening was performed in all enrolled patients.
3086,333,"Among twenty enrolled subjects, seventeen of them had systemic lupus erythematosus; four of them were diagnosed as SS with positive Schirmer test."
3087,333,"In addition to antinuclear antibodies and anti-DNA antibodies, other common autoantibodies were anti-RNP antibodies (50 %) and anti-Sm antibodies(30 %)."
3088,333,The most common symptoms were arthritis (60 %)followed by malar rash (40 %).
3089,333,"In conclusion, we observed that a low proportion of childhood SS (4/20) exists in our patients with positive SSA and/or anti-SSB antibodies."
3090,333,"It is suggested that clinicians should focus more on the clinical symptoms in these patients, rather than undertaking invasive diagnostic interventions to rule out Sjgren's syndrome."
3091,334,A new approach for the classification of patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) has been recently proposed.
3092,334,"Although these new criteria substantially differ from the American European Consensus Group criteria, which have represented the gold standard for the last decade, when compared with each other the two sets show a high statistical degree of agreement."
3093,334,"However, the fact that two different criteria to classify patient with SS could be available may introduce some additional difficulties in the scientific communication, making cohorts of patients selected by using different methods less than completely equivalent, and the results of epidemiological studies and therapeutic trials not entirely comparable."
3094,334,"Consequently, to reach a consensus agreement on universally accepted classification criteria for SS seems to be a very desirable objective."
3095,335,INTRODUCTION: The aims of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of blood B-cell subset profiling and immune-system activation marker assays in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and to assess whether adding these tools to the current laboratory item would improve the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria.
3096,335,"METHODS: In a single-center cohort of patients with suspected pSS, we tested the diagnostic performance of anti-SSA, antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), gammaglobulins, IgG titers, and B-cell ratio defined as (Bm2+Bm2')/(eBm5+Bm5), determined using flow cytometry."
3097,335,The reference standard was a clinical diagnosis of pSS established by a panel of experts.
3098,335,"RESULTS: Of 181 patients included in the study, 77 had pSS."
3099,335,"By logistic regression analysis, only ANA 1:640 (sensitivity, 70.4%; specificity 83.2%) and B-cell ratio 5 (sensitivity, 52.1%; specificity, 83.2%) showed independent associations with pSS of similar strength."
3100,335,"In anti-SSA-negative patients, presence of either of these two criteria had 71.0% sensitivity but only 67.3% specificity for pSS; whereas combining both criteria had 96.2% specificity but only 12.9% sensitivity."
3101,335,"Adding either of these two criteria to the AECG criteria set increased sensitivity from 83.1% to 90.9% but decreased specificity from 97.1% to 85.6%, whereas adding both criteria in combination did not substantially modify the diagnostic performance of the criteria set."
3102,335,"The adjunction of RF+ANA 1:320, as proposed in the new American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, did not improve the diagnostic value of anti-SSA."
3103,335,CONCLUSIONS: Blood B-cell subset profiling is a simple test that has good diagnostic properties for pSS.
3104,335,"However, adding this test, with or without ANA positivity, does not improve current classification criteria."
3105,336,Inclusion body myositis (IBM) belongs to the group of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.
3106,336,"It is a poorly understood disease, which affects skeletal muscles."
3107,336,"IBM usually occurs as an isolated condition, but in some cases, it may be associated with another autoimmune disorder, Sjgren's syndrome."
3108,336,"We report a case of a 47-year-old woman with headaches, symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia, progressive weakness in muscles of the upper and lower extremities and symptoms of dry eyes and mouth."
3109,336,"On admission, creatine kinase level was increased to 6,956 IU/mL and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to 1,011 U/L in the serum."
3110,336,"The increase in inflammatory factor (CRP, ESR) levels was not found."
3111,336,The diagnosis of inclusion body myositis associated with Sjgren's syndrome was established on the basis of clinical picture and diagnostic tests.
3112,336,"In this therapy, methotrexate and methylprednisolone were administered."
3113,336,"The considerable improved muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities, improved speech and swallowing, disappearance of headache and reduction in CPK and LDH levels were found 8 months after establishing the diagnosis."
3114,336,Treatment with methotrexate and methylprednisolone improved the clinical symptoms and quality of life of this patient and may offer a therapeutic option for some patients with IBM and concomitant Sjgren's syndrome.
3115,337,The authors report an exceptional case of an anterior horn syndrome associated with Sjgren's syndrome in a 58-year-old patient with a flaccid tetraparesis revealed by asymmetric atrophy and diffuse fasciculations associated with xerostomia and xerophthalmia.
3116,337,The electroneuromyography objectified a diffuse anterior horn syndrome.
3117,337,The brain MRI and spinal cord were normal.
3118,337,Laboratory tests revealed positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibody.
3119,337,The salivary glands biopsy objectified lymphocytic sialadenitis grade 3 of Chisholm.
3120,337,The Schirmer's test was abnormally low.
3121,337,Diagnosis of anterior horn syndrome as part of Sjgren's syndrome was retained.
3122,337,The methylprednisolone bolus allowed partial clinical improvement after 12months of evolution.
3123,337,"Therefore, in patients with isolated anterior horn involvement, a correct diagnosis of the underlying SS is often delayed or overlooked entirely; in these instances, standard clinicoserological assessment is recommendable."
3124,338,PURPOSE: To compare the effect of autologous serum eye drops with different diluents in patients with dry eyes and persistent epithelial defects.
3125,338,"METHODS: Patients of Sjgren's syndrome (Group I), non-Sjgren's syndrome (group II) with dry eye, and persistent epithelial defects (Group III) were included."
3126,338,"The eyes of each group were randomly treated with one of the following autologous serum eye drops: 100% serum (AS(100)), 50% serum with normal saline (AS(50NS)); 50% serum with sodium hyaluronate (AS(50HA)); or 50% serum with ceftazidime (AS(50CEF))."
3127,338,"The differences in dry eye symptoms, Schirmer test I, tear break-up time (TBUT), corneal staining, and speed in epithelial healing were studied."
3128,338,"RESULTS: In Group I, AS(100) showed fewer symptoms than AS(50NS), AS(50HA) and AS(50CEF) (all p < 0.01)."
3129,338,"AS(100) showed significantly better effect than AS(50NS), AS(50HA) and AS(50CEF) in decreasing corneal staining at the time point of 12-week post-treatment (p = 0.041, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively)."
3130,338,"In Group II, AS(100) was more effective than AS(50CEF) in decreasing symptoms and decreasing corneal staining (all p < 0.05)."
3131,338,There was no significant difference in symptom and corneal staining between AS(100) and AS(50NS).
3132,338,"In Group III, AS(100) was the most effective in achieving quick epithelial closure."
3133,338,"CONCLUSION: In the eyes with Sjgren syndrome and persistent epithelial defects, AS(100) was the most effective in decreasing symptoms, corneal epitheliopathy and promoting fast closure of wound."
3134,338,"In the eyes with non-Sjgren syndrome, AS(100) and AS(50NS) have similar effects in decreasing symptoms and corneal epitheliopathy."
3135,339,"The Sjogren's syndrome is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that affects primarily the exocrine glands, but can affect other organs particularly the lungs."
3136,339,Cystic lung disease is very significant but exceptionally recounted in the literature.
3137,339,"We report the case of a patient, 54 years old, whose disease was discovered incidentally after a routine chest radiograph."
3138,339,"The diagnosis of cystic lung revealing a primary Sjogren's syndrome was held before a group of radio-clinical, immunological and histological arguments."
3139,339,"Through our observation, the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome should be included in the list of diagnoses to raise in a multicystic lung."
3140,340,BACKGROUND: Sjgren's syndrome is a rheumatological condition.
3141,340,Diagnosing Sjgren's syndrome can be challenging given the overlapping nature of clinical presentations.
3142,340,"Currently, minor salivary gland biopsy is considered the definitive test for diagnosing Sjgren's syndrome."
3143,340,"Various surgical techniques have been described, targeting biopsy of minor salivary glands from the lower lip."
3144,340,Identification of minor salivary glands is often difficult because of bleeding.
3145,340,One common complication of minor salivary gland biopsy is lip paraesthesia from iatrogenic sensory nerve injury.
3146,340,"OBJECTIVES: To describe a minor salivary gland biopsy technique in a bloodless operative field using a chalazion ophthalmic clamp under local anaesthesia, and to report our clinical outcomes."
3147,340,METHODS: A prospective study was performed on patients who underwent minor salivary gland biopsy using a chalazion ophthalmic clamp between July 2017 and April 2018.
3148,340,RESULTS: The study included 23 patients.
3149,340,The histopathological reports positively identified minor salivary glands for all patients.
3150,340,"In nine cases, the histological findings were positive for Sjgren's syndrome."
3151,340,No lip paraesthesia complications were reported post-operatively.
3152,340,"CONCLUSION: This technique facilitates a superior yield, ensures adequate sampling of appropriate glands for histopathological analysis, and minimises the complications associated with traditional techniques."
3153,341,Cross-reactions with cardiolipin antibodies and serological lues tests are common.
3154,341,We examined a 37 year old patient with neurological symptoms and signs of Sjoegren's syndrome and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome.
3155,341,But the lues screening test was also positive and the serological tests following approved the lues infection.
3156,341,When an autoimmune disease is diagnosed with the presence of cardiolipin antibodies we recommend also testing for treponema pallidum as a possible disease.
3157,342,We have investigated the prevalence of dry mouth among patients with autoimmune diseases other than Sjgren's syndrome.
3158,342,"One hundred and forty-four patients, excluding patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome, were enrolled in this study."
3159,342,"The volume of saliva secreted was measured with the screening technique for estimation of salivary flow, which uses a filter paper for diagnosing dry mouth."
3160,342,Disturbed salivary secretion was observed in 84 (58.3 %) of the 144 patients.
3161,342,"In the case of patients free of Sjgren's syndrome, the prevalence of disturbed salivary secretion differed significantly among the disease groups (P < 0.05), with the prevalence being over 50 % in all disease groups other than the rheumatoid arthritis group and the highest in the systemic sclerosis group."
3162,342,"There was significant positive correlation between the number of colored spots and oral visual analog scale score (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001)."
3163,342,"Autoimmune diseases can be accompanied by salivary gland dysfunction, regardless of the presence/absence of complication by Sjgren's syndrome."
3164,342,"In the present study, the screening technique for estimation of salivary flow, which uses a filter paper for diagnosing dry mouth, was shown to be a useful means of detecting salivary gland dysfunction."
3165,343,"PURPOSE: To compare the temperatures of the ocular surface, eyelid, and periorbital skin in normal eyes with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) eyes, evaporative dry eyes (EDE), and aqueous deficient dry eyes (ADDE)."
3166,343,"METHODS: 10 eyes were analyzed in each age-matched group (normal, SS, EDE, and ADDE)."
3167,343,"A noninvasive infrared thermal camera captured two-dimensional images in three regions of interest (ROI) in each of three areas: the ocular surface, the upper eyelid, and the periorbital skin within a controlled environmental chamber."
3168,343,Mean temperatures in each ROI were calculated from the videos.
3169,343,Ocular surface time-segmented cooling rates were calculated over a 5-s blink interval.
3170,343,"RESULTS: Relative to normal eyes, dry eyes had lower initial central OSTs (SS -0.71C, EDE -0.55C, ADDE -0.95C, KW P<.0001) and lower central upper lid temperatures (SS -0.24C, ADDE -0.51C, and EDE -0.54C, KW P<.0001)."
3171,343,"ADDE eyes had the lowest initial central OST (P<.0001), while EDE eyes had the lowest central lid temperature and lower periorbital temperatures (P<.0001)."
3172,343,"Over the 5-s interblink interval, the greatest rate of temperature loss occurred following eyelid opening, but varied by group (normals -0.52, SS -0.73, EDE -0.63, and ADDE -0.75C/s)."
3173,343,The ADDE group also had the most substantial heat loss over the 5-s interblink interval (-0.97C).
3174,343,CONCLUSIONS: Differences in OST may be related to thermal differences in lids and periorbita along with an altered tear film.
3175,343,"Thermography of the ocular surface, lids, and surrounding tissues may help to differentiate between different etiologies of dry eye."
3176,344,A 64-year-old previously healthy man presented with acute ataxia.
3177,344,"He was diagnosed with acute cerebellitis on the basis of clinical features, negative MRI of the head and lymphocytic pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid."
3178,344,A detailed work up for etiology revealed auto-antibodies for Sjogren's syndrome.
3179,344,He responded well to cyclophosphamide and steroids.
3180,345,A 25-year-old woman in her 37 weeks and 5 days pregnant presented with abnormal behavior and memory impairment following a high fever.
3181,345,"Her manifestations were diagnosed as limbic encephalitis, and she delivered a baby by Cesarean section."
3182,345,"In the operation, bilateral ovarian tumors were found and resected, though they were revealed as non-teratoma afterward."
3183,345,"After operation, she became agitated, and started to present oral dyskinesia, intractable systemic myoclonus, central hypoventilation, and autonomic manifestations such as labile blood pressure, but her symptoms responded well to immunotherapy."
3184,345,"Her clinical course was typical for anti-N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis, but anti-NMDA receptor antibody was not detected in her serum and CSF."
3185,345,"On the other hand, anti SS-A antibody was positive in her serum, and the lip biopsy findings confirmed Sjgren's syndrome (SjS)."
3186,345,"Only several cases of SjS-associated limbic encephalitis have been reported, but none of them mimicked anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis."
3187,345,This patient indicates that SjS should be considered even in a case of limbic encephalitis with a typical clinical spectrum of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
3188,346,INTRODUCTION: Upper digestive symptoms may be present in up to 50% of patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS).
3189,346,We report a retrospective cohort of gastroparesis in a population of pSS presenting unexplained dyspepsia.
3190,346,Delayed gastric emptying was defined by a gastric emptying time above 113min or by a retention percentage at 4h more than 10% on scintigraphy.
3191,346,RESULTS: Eleven patients with primary Sjgren syndrome and gastroparesis were included in a retrospective study.
3192,346,Every patients were women of age 4818y.
3193,346,"The average time of gastric emptying was 725,18704,45min."
3194,346,64% of patients had abdominal pain or gastric heaviness.
3195,346,A central or peripheral neurologic involvement was described in respectively 9 and 27% of cases.
3196,346,The diagnostic delay of gastroparesis was higher than 24 months.
3197,346,"CONCLUSION: In primary Sjgren syndrome, gastroparesis should be suspected in case of unexplained dyspepsia, and a scintigraphy performed to prove the diagnosis."
3198,346,"A neurologic involvement could explain gastroparesis, but prospective studies are needed for a better understanding of this disorder."
3199,347,PURPOSE: To explore the feasibility of parotid spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (T1) MR imaging in the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) without morphological changes of the parotid glands.
3200,347,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study enrolled 32 consecutive SS patients without morphological changes of parotid glands and 32 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers who underwent parotid 3.0 Tesla MR imaging, including T1 sequences."
3201,347,Follow-up imaging was performed at 3 months.
3202,347,T1 signal intensities and T1 values of bilateral parotid glands were compared using paired samples t-test.
3203,347,Parotid T1 signal intensities and T1 values were compared using two independent samples t-test.
3204,347,Diagnostic performance of the parotid T1 values was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis.
3205,347,The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to evaluate the reproducibility of parotid T1 measurements.
3206,347,"RESULTS: There were no significant differences of T1 signal intensities and T1 values between bilateral parotid glands in SS patients and healthy volunteers (P=0.170, 0.886 and 0.942, 0.229)."
3207,347,"The parotid T1 values of SS patients (96.4715.38 ms) were significantly higher than those of healthy volunteers (84.256.11 ms) (P<0.001), while there were no significant differences of T1 signal intensities between SS patients and healthy volunteers (P=0.655)."
3208,347,"With a cutoff value of 88.02 ms, the sensitivity and specificity of the parotid T1 value was 75.0% and 100.0% in the diagnosis of SS."
3209,347,The reproducibility of parotid T1 measurement was excellent (ICC: 0.934-0.995).
3210,347,CONCLUSION: Parotid T1 MR imaging held a potential role in diagnosing SS without morphological changes of parotid glands.

3215,348,This study was designed to measure the effect of different artificial tears on the contrast sensitivity of Sjgren's syndrome patients from 5 minutes to 4 hours after instillation.
3216,348,"METHODS: Ten normal subjects and 10 subjects with ocular manifestations of Sjgren's syndrome were compared at baseline, including staining scores, a dry eye questionnaire, and contrast sensitivity testing."
3217,348,Changes in contrast sensitivity in the Sjgren's syndrome group were measured over a 4-hour period after instillation of a variety of artificial tears.
3218,348,"RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in staining, subjective questionnaire scores, and contrast sensitivity were measured between the normal and Sjgren's syndrome groups."
3219,348,"Statistically significant changes in contrast sensitivity were measured over time after artificial tear instillation, with the greatest effect at 3 to 6 cycles/deg."
3220,348,The more mucoadhesive artificial tears demonstrated a significantly greater effect.
3221,348,"CONCLUSIONS: The effects of artificial tears on measured contrast sensitivity in dry eye patients in the postinstillation period of 5 minutes to 4 hours appear limited, but an artificial tear with more mucoadhesive properties showed more benefit than those that do not."
3222,348,"Modest effects on contrast sensitivity, primarily at medium spatial frequencies, were observed with the more mucoadhesive formulations."
3223,349,"INTRODUCTION: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology, clinically manifested by dry eyes (xerophthalmia) and dry mouth (xerostomia)."
3224,349,"In childhood SS is a rare disease, clinically atypically or asymptomatic and is often unrecognized."
3225,349,"We report a girl with asymptomatic, juvenile form of primary Sjgren's syndrome (JSS)."
3226,349,CASE OUTLINE: A 13-year-old girl was initially observed for several months due to elevated sedimentation rate (ESR 75-90 mm/h) without signs of inflammation or other symptoms and disease signs.
3227,349,Subjective symptoms of dryness of the eyes and mouth were absent at the beginning.
3228,349,Ophthalmologic examination demonstrated hypolacrimia although the patients had no subjective signs of xerophthalmia.
3229,349,Ultrasonography (US) revealed mild enlargement and heterogeneity of large salivary glands parenchyma.
3230,349,"Increased rheumatoid factor (RF), anti SS-A/Ro, anti SS-B/La antibodies were found in serum."
3231,349,"Ophthalmologic examination demonstrated decreased lacrimation.JSS was confirmed on the basis of ophthalmologic examination, immunological tests, histological findings of biopsy of small and US of major salivary glands."
3232,349,During a 12-years follow-up period systemic or extraglandular manifestations of JSS and other autoimmune diseases were not observed.
3233,349,CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that in the differential diagnosis of unexplained elevated ESR the primary form of JSS should be also taken into consideration.
3234,349,Ultrasonographic changes of major salivary glands in the absence of symptoms of xerostomia point out that this noninvasive method has an important role in the diagnosis and management of patients with JSS.
3235,350,"Salivary gland disease covers a wide range of pathological entities, including salivary gland-specific disease, as well as manifestations of systemic diseases."
3236,350,"This chapter discusses the recent advances in managing obstructive salivary gland disease, the move from gland excision to gland preservation, the dilemmas in diagnosing and managing tumours of the salivary glands, and the international data collection to understand the aetiology and progression of Sjgren's disease."
3237,351,"PURPOSE: To evaluate corneal innervation and inflammatory cell infiltration using in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) and to correlate these findings with subjective symptoms of dry eye, as measured by the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) in patients with non-Sjgren's (NSDE) and Sjgren's syndrome dry eyes (SSDE)."
3238,351,"METHODS: Central corneal images were prospectively captured from 10 age-matched healthy control eyes, 24 eyes with clinically diagnosed NSDE and 44 eyes with clinically diagnosed SSDE, using IVCM (HRT III RCM)."
3239,351,"Density, tortuosity and reflectivity of corneal nerves, presence of inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs) and OSDI scores were evaluated."
3240,351,RESULTS: Images obtained by IVCM from 78 eyes were analyzed.
3241,351,"The density of nerve fibers was 1562996m/frame in the SSDE group, 21501015m/frame in the NSDE group and 2725687m/frame in the control group (P<0.05, ANOVA)."
3242,351,"In comparison to the control group, the density of nerve fibers was decreased in the SSDE (P<0.001) and the NSDE groups (P=0.06), with increased nerve tortuosity and decreased reflectivity in both groups (both P<0.05)."
3243,351,"The density of DCs was 71.6572.54 cells/mm(2) in the SSDE group, 40.3331.63 cells/mm(2) in the NSDE group and 27.535.58 cells/mm(2) in the control group (P<0.05, ANOVA)."
3244,351,"In comparison to the control group, the density of DCs was increased in the SSDE (P<0.001) and the NSDE groups (P=0.07)."
3245,351,"Significant correlations were found between the nerve density and DC density (r=-0.57, P<0.001), between the nerve density and OSDI scores (r=-0.91, P<0.001) and between the nerve reflectivity and OSDI scores (r=-0.75, P<0.001)."
3246,351,CONCLUSIONS: The corneas of eyes affected with NSDE and SSDE are characterized by alterations in corneal innervation and infiltration of inflammatory DCs.
3247,351,"Corneal nerve density and reflectivity are correlated with severity of subjective dry eye symptoms, as measured by OSDI score."
3248,352,Juvenile Sjgren's syndrome is a rare condition that affects children and adolescents with distinctive clinical features.
3249,352,"Parotid swelling usually precedes regular oral and ocular symptoms, while typical serological findings may be absent."
3250,352,"Hence, diagnosing juvenile Sjgren's syndrome may be challenging to the attending pediatric dentist, and long-term management without proper diagnosis may be jeopardized."
3251,352,The purpose of this report was to detail the features of an adolescent with primary Sjgren's syndrome diagnosed 12 years after the onset of the disease.
3252,352,An updated literature review highlighted the unusual aspects of the pediatric form of the disease.
3253,353,"Patients with either benign or malignant parotid neoplasm are candidates for surgery, but patients with benign lymphoepithelial lesions of the parotid gland or Sjgren's syndrome do not necessarily require surgical treatment."
3254,353,"However, the diagnosis of benign lymphoepithelial lesion of the parotid prior to surgery is challenging."
3255,353,"In this case series, we retrospectively analyzed the records of 11 patients presented between January 2006 and August 2007, with a solitary parotid mass diagnosed post-operatively as benign lymphoepithelial lesion or Sjgren's syndrome."
3256,353,Our analysis suggested that findings from physical examination and CT and MRI scans in the absence of neoplastic cells on fine needle aspiration biopsy could be used to make the diagnosis of lymphoepithelial lesion preoperatively.
3257,353,"In a prospective study from September 2007 to June 2008, using the lessons learned from the analysis of the previous 11 patients, we were able to diagnose all 6 cases of benign lymphoepithelial lesion or Sjgren's syndrome preoperatively."
3258,354,Connective tissue diseases are known to be one of the causes of organising pneumonia (OP).
3259,354,"However, this association is rare and signs of OP usually occur in the context of an already diagnosed disease."
3260,354,We report three cases of OP preceding the articular symptoms of the underlying connective tissue disease by 3-6 months in two cases of rheumatoid arthritis and by 36 months in one patient with primary Sjgren's syndrome.
3261,354,The diagnosis of post-infectious OP had initially been suspected in the three cases and the patients had not been followed up further.
3262,354,"The occurrence of OP preceding articular or any other extrapulmonary involvement of connective tissue disease had been reported in only four cases in the literature and, to our knowledge, no case preceding Sjgren's syndrome had ever been reported."
3263,354,"These observations suggest that exhaustive investigations should be considered when OP is diagnosed, including antinuclear auto-antibodies and investigations for Sjgren's syndrome, even when there are no clinical signs suggesting an underlying connective tissue disease."
3264,354,"These investigations should also be repeated during the course of the disease, especially in the case of OP continuing to progress under treatment and, of course, if signs of connective tissue disease appear."
3265,355,IgG4-related systemic disease/systemic IgG4-related disease has been established as a new systemic disease entity.
3266,355,It is characterized by high serum IgG4 concentrations and abundant IgG4-bearing plasma cell infiltration in the involved organs.
3267,355,"The chronic inflammation can attack lacrimal glands, salivary glands, the thyroid, lung, pancreas, kidney, and prostate."
3268,355,"The concept includes Mikulicz's disease, Riedel's thyroiditis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary pseudotumor, autoimmune pancreatitis, a part of tubulointerstitial nephritis, and chronic prostatitis."
3269,355,It is important to note that these lesions can occur at different times and sites.
3270,355,"So, it is necessary to reconfirm the disease definition and entity in each specialized field."
3271,355,The diagnosis of this disease is confirmed by the above serological and histopathological characteristics.
3272,355,"There are clinical diagnostic criteria of Mikulicz's disease (the Japanese Medical Society for Sjgren's Syndrome) and autoimmune pancreatitis (the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and the Japan Pancreas Society)."
3273,355,They are convenient and useful.
3274,355,"Glucocorticoid improves the physical abnormalities, and the initial dose of prednisolone is 30 mg/day, tapered in 5-mg reductions every two weeks."
3275,355,"Nevertheless, there are some cases unable to achieve complete remission."
3276,356,"Since the first report of serum IgG4 elevation in sclerosing pancreatitis in 2001, various systemic disorders have been reported to elevate IgG4, and many names have been proposed from the perspective of the systemic condition."
3277,356,"Despite similarities in the organs damaged in IgG4-related Mikulicz's disease and Sjgren's syndrome, there are marked clinical and pathological differences between the 2 entities."
3278,356,"The majority of cases diagnosed with autoimmune pancreatitis in Japan are IgG4-related sclerosing pancreatitis, and it should be recognized that this is distinct from the Western type."
3279,356,"Diagnosis of IgG4-related disease is defined by both elevated serum IgG4 (> 1.35 g/l) and histopathological features, including lymphocyte and IgG4+ plasma cell infiltration (IgG4+ plasma cells/IgG+ plasma cells > 50% on a highly magnified slide checked at 5 points)."
3280,356,"Differential diagnosis from other distinct disorders is necessary: these include sarcoidosis, Castleman's disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, lymphoma, cancer, and other existing conditions."
3281,356,The Japanese IgG4 research group has begun multicenter prospective studies to improve diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies.
3282,357,We describe a case of a 50-year-old lady with newly diagnosed primary Sjogren syndrome who presented with severe pulmonary artery hypertension and pericardial effusion.
3283,357,She was managed by immunosuppressive agents and a combination of standard therapy for pulmonary hypertension.
3284,357,Our patient had a clinically significant involvement of cardio-pulmonary system that is atypical of this disease.
3285,357,Prompt recognition and management of this condition are extremely crucial as untreated cases carry a grave prognosis.
3286,357,"However, the ideal treatment strategy is yet to be defined for this condition."
3287,358,"In a number of autoimmune diseases, for example, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, it is known that autoantibodies are present before the clinical onset."
3288,358,Recently we have shown that autoantibodies can be found many years before symptom onset in primary Sjgren's syndrome.
3289,358,This implies that screening for autoantibodies may be used to identify individuals at risk of developing systemic autoimmune disease.
3290,358,"Possibly, autoantibody screening may also contribute to detection of incipient malignancy."
3291,358,"This concept stems from a novel finding, on scleroderma patients, suggesting that an anti-tumor immune response elicited by a mutated self-antigen will cross-react with the unmodified version of the self-antigen, and thus come to trigger the formation of autoantibodies."
3292,359,The authors focus on the assessment of ocular manifestation in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome using the Ocular Staining Score.
3293,359,"The method offers the possibility to stain different ocular structures separately: cornea with fluorescein and conjunctiva with lissamine green dye and provides for separate evaluation of abnormalities, unlike the current system assessing ocular damage where ocular tissues are stained either with bengal rose or lissamine green dye."
3294,359,"The paper presents new criteria for the diagnosis of dry eye secondary to the autoimmune Sjgren's syndrome and their high specificity (94.7% and 93.3%) based on the results of clinical trials in 1618 patients, conducted by an international research team."
3295,360,This review will summarise the state of the art of salivary diagnostics in primary Sjgren's syndrome exploring the potential usefulness of both traditional and emerging biotechnologies for primary Sjgren's syndrome non-invasive and early detection.
3296,361,"RATIONALE: Peripheral neurological complications in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) seem the most common, however the involvement of central nervous system (CNS) remains unclear."
3297,361,"While abnormalities in pSS revealed by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are usually small discrete hyperintense areas in the white matter on T2-FLAIR weighted MRI, massive brain lesions have been rarely reported, particularly in bilateral basal ganglia."
3298,361,"PATIENT CONCERNS: A 51-year-old woman exhibited dizziness, slurred speech and hemiplegia as a manifestation of pSS."
3299,361,"Brain MRI revealed bilateral and symmetrical lesions extending into the basal ganglia, corona radiata and corpus callosum."
3300,361,"DIAGNOSES: Primary Sjgren's syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of clinical features, abnormal Schirmer's test and tear break-up time (BUT) findings, high levels of anti-Sjgren's-syndrome-related antigen A (anti-SSA) (Ro) and anti-Sjgren's-syndrome-related antigen B (anti-SSB) (La) antibodies, and positive labial minor salivary gland biopsy results."
3301,361,INTERVENTIONS: She was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and discharged on oral steroid therapy of prednisolone acetate.
3302,361,OUTCOMES: The patient had an excellent response to steroid therapy.
3303,361,"LESSONS: The present case suggests that symmetry bilateral lesions can occur as a symptom of pSS, which could be induced by an autoimmune mechanism."
3304,362,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary manifestations (PMs) in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) are among the most frequent extraglandular complications, with reported prevalence varying widely (9-75%), depending on the methods of detection."
3305,362,OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of PMs in pSS and to determine the factors predisposing to the occurrence of this complication.
3306,362,MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 68 patients with pSS.
3307,362,"Among the patients who were possibly affected by PMs, chest High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) was performed."
3308,362,"RESULTS: In the group of all patients afflicted with pSS, 30 people indicated the need to expand medical imaging via chest HRCT scan."
3309,362,"(The most frequent reason, in 80%, was persistent, dry cough periodically waking up patients at night)."
3310,362,The chest HRCT scan revealed lung tissue changes in the course of 29% of all examined patients (of 68).
3311,362,"No correlation was found between the occurrence of HRCT changes and the age of patients (p = 0.8), increased CRP > 5 mg/1 (p = 0.1) or ESR > 20 mm/h (p = 0.9), focus score (p = 0.8), leucopenia (p = 0.5), RF value (p = 0.3), gamma globulin value (p = 0.5), intensity of eye and oral cavity dryness (p = 0.6; 0.3) and smoking cigarettes."
3312,362,"Additionally, no correlation was found between more frequent occurrences of antibodies anti-SSA, anti-SSB or anti-Ro52 and HRCT changes (p = 0.3; 0.07; 0.4)."
3313,362,"Pertaining to the clinical signs, HRCT changes occurred more often only in patients suffering from peripheral arthritis (p < 0.01)."
3314,362,CONCLUSIONS: PM is a frequent symptom of pSS.
3315,362,A factor predisposing to the development of changes in the respiratory system was not found.
3316,362,Changes in HRCT occur more frequently in patients with peripheral arthritis.
3317,363,OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic value of salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) for primary SS (pSS) and to compare the usefulness of two existing SGUS scoring systems.
3318,363,METHODS: Ultrasonography examination of major salivary glands was conducted for 105 pSS patients and 41 disease control subjects without SS and 16 healthy control subjects.
3319,363,"The imaging features were graded using two different scoring systems (0-16 and 0-48, respectively) obtained from the grades of bilateral parotid and submandibular glands."
3320,363,Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to describe and compare the diagnostic accuracy of the two ultrasonography echostructure scoring systems for pSS.
3321,363,The agreement of diagnosis for pSS between the two scoring systems was determined by -statistics.
3322,363,RESULTS: SGUS scores for the pSS group were significantly higher than those for the non-pSS group (P < 0.001).
3323,363,"The best score cut-off was 7 in the 0-16 system (80% sensitivity and 93% specificity, respectively), and it was 15 in the 0-48 system (88.6% sensitivity and 84.2% specificity, respectively)."
3324,363,"Compared with the 0-16 system, combined evaluation of all four glands when using the 0-48 system improved the diagnostic accuracy."
3325,363,"Association analysis of both scoring systems showed a positive correlation of SGUS scores with RF and -globulin% (P < 0.05, overall)."
3326,363,CONCLUSION: SGUS is a feasible method for pSS diagnosis with higher sensitivity using the 0-48 system and better specificity using the 0-16 system.
3327,363,SGUS scores are related to RF and -globulin%.
3328,364,A 67-year-old woman was diagnosed with ileocolic Crohn's disease at 61 years of age.
3329,364,"Remission had been induced by the monoclonal antibody adalimumab, and maintenance therapy had continued since her diagnosis."
3330,364,"However, she developed respiratory symptoms, including a dry cough."
3331,364,A chest CT scan revealed interstitial shadows in the lower pulmonary lobes.
3332,364,"Although no sicca symptoms were noted, she was serologically positive for both anti-Sjgren's syndrome-related antigen A and B antibodies, and salivary gland biopsy showed lymphocytic infiltration."
3333,364,"Consequently, she was diagnosed as having asymptomatic Sjgren's syndrome."
3334,364,"Infection or drug-induced pulmonary disease was considered unlikely, and the interstitial pneumonia was considered an extra-glandular presentation of Sjgren's syndrome."
3335,364,"Thus, interstitial shadows, which appear during immunotherapy for Crohn's disease, could indicate asymptomatic Sjgren's syndrome; clinicians should consider this rare clinical picture when assessing such a patient."
3336,365,BACKGROUND: The international classification criteria for Sjgren's syndrome necessitate the presence of either extractable nuclear antibody or a characteristic focal inflammatory infiltrate in a minor salivary gland.
3337,365,"Thus, patients who are extractable nuclear antibody-negative will need to have a labial salivary gland biopsy, which is an invasive procedure associated with morbidity."
3338,365,The aim of this study was to evaluate the viability of ultrasound imaging of the major salivary glands as a predictor of the histology to explore whether ultrasound can help in stratifying Sjgren's patients and reduce the need for biopsy.
3339,365,METHODS: The records of 85 patients suspected of having Sjgren's syndrome and who have had biopsy and ultrasound were analysed retrospectively.
3340,365,The histology and the ultrasound were reported by experts independently.
3341,365,The reporting was impartial as the examiners were blinded to the results of the other investigations and to the diagnosis.
3342,365,"RESULTS: Out of the 85 patients, 34 had positive ultrasound, 29 of whom also had positive histology."
3343,365,"Fifty-one patients had negative ultrasound, of whom 49 were also negative for histological features of Sjgren's syndrome."
3344,365,The results show that the ultrasound had a positive predictive value of 85% and a striking negative predicative value of 96% of the histology results.
3345,365,The overall concordance between the ultrasound and the histology was 91% (Kappa = 0.826).
3346,365,CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that potentially the ultrasound has a role in stratifying patients who are extractable nuclear antibody-negative and can help to prioritize the biopsy for those who have sonographic evidence of SS.
3347,366,"BACKGROUND: Sjgren's syndrome is characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands, together with polyclonal B-cell activation, and lung diseases are well-known complications of the disease."
3348,366,"Therefore, in most cases associated with Sjgren's syndrome, infiltrating lymphocytes in the lung specimen exhibit the features of B-cells."
3349,366,We herein report an atypical case of lymphoproliferative pulmonary involvement in a patient with Sjgren's syndrome.
3350,366,CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of an abnormal chest roentgenogram finding on a medical checkup.
3351,366,Chest computed tomography showed randomly-distributed micronodules and patchy ground-glass opacities.
3352,366,A surgical biopsied specimen showed an atypical pattern of interstitial pneumonia with numerous lymphoid follicles.
3353,366,"Among the infiltrating lymphocytes in the lung, only the monoclonality of the T-cells was proven by a gene rearrangement analysis, but there was no cytological atypicality or genetic disorder revealed by testing the bone marrow aspirate."
3354,366,A diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome was made based on the patient's other symptoms and these negative findings.
3355,366,The patient's pulmonary lesions have been successfully treated and remission has been maintained for over three years with corticosteroid treatment alone.
3356,366,CONCLUSION: The present patient was an atypical case of lymphoproliferative pulmonary involvement in a patient with Sjgren's syndrome.
3357,366,"Although monoclonality of the infiltrating T-cells was proven, the clinical course and the findings of the imaging and laboratory examinations were inconsistent with the previously-reported cases of primary pulmonary T-cell lymphoma."
3358,366,This suggests that the monoclonality of lymphocytes does not always define malignancy.
3359,366,"The diagnosis of malignant lymphoma or lymphoproliferative diseases should be made clinically, pathologically and cytogenetically to rule out other similar diseases."
3360,367,"BACKGROUND: Central nervous system involvement with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is rare, and often undiagnosed."
3361,367,Sjgren's syndrome and concomitant intracranial hypertension is a very rare event.
3362,367,CASE: We describe a patient with pSS who presented with intracranial hypertension as the initial symptom of the disease.
3363,367,CONCLUSION: This is the first case report of a patient with pSS that presented with intracranial hypertension only.
3364,368,"Interstitial lung diseases, especially lymphoproliferative disorders such as follicular bronchiolitis and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, are commonly seen in association with Sjgren syndrome."
3365,368,"Although the predominant computed tomographic (CT) findings in patients with lymphoid interstitial pneumonia/follicular bronchiolitis include poorly defined centrilobular nodules and ground-glass attenuation, cystic changes can be seen in approximately two-thirds of these patients."
3366,368,"The objective of this study was to define the clinical, radiological, and histopathological features of cyst-predominant lymphoid interstitial pneumonia/follicular bronchiolitis in patients with Sjgren syndrome."
3367,368,We present four patients who were referred to our institution with diffuse cystic changes on chest CT imaging.
3368,368,All four had a presumptive diagnosis of lymphangioleiomyomatosis but were subsequently found to have Sjgren syndrome.
3369,368,"The diagnosis was established based on the clinical symptoms of xerostomia and xerophthalmia along with serologic detection of antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Sjgren's syndrome-related antigen A (SSA)/Ro antibodies, and anti-Sjgren's syndrome-related antigen B (SSB)/La antibodies."
3370,368,The cystic pattern associated with Sjgren syndrome had a characteristic appearance on chest CT images.
3371,368,"Typical features included a wide variation in cyst size, internal structure within cysts, geographic simplification of parenchymal architecture producing a ""dissolving lung appearance,"" perivascular and often basilar-predominant distribution, and frequent association with ground-glass opacities and nodules."
3372,368,"In a compatible clinical context, we submit that these findings can be sufficiently distinctive to obviate the need for lung biopsy, even in the absence of confirmatory serological studies or lip biopsy."
3373,368,Clinicians should consider occult Sjgren syndrome in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with idiopathic diffuse cystic lung disease.
3374,369,"OBJECTIVE: The objective is to determine the relationship between clinical features and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) development in primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS), taking recently designed disease activity/severity scores into account."
3375,369,"METHODS: Medical charts of pSS patients were retrospectively analyzed, scoring first and last visits with the (cumulative) EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index and counting extraglandular manifestations, comparing patients with and without NHL."
3376,369,RESULTS: One hundred ninety-five patients were analyzed with a median follow-up of 92 months (range 12-256).
3377,369,Twenty-one patients (11%) had NHL.
3378,369,Associations of parotid gland enlargement (OR 2.84) and low C4 (OR 7.71) with NHL were confirmed.
3379,369,"In NHL patients, development of purpura, peripheral neuropathy (PNP), and glomerulonephritis (GN) concurred with lymphoma in 3/3, 5/7, and 2/2 of cases, respectively."
3380,369,"Otherwise, purpura and PNP were not associated with NHL later on."
3381,369,"This suggests that these symptoms might represent paraneoplastic events (in 16%, 24%, and 100% of our cases, respectively)."
3382,369,Presence of IgM-kappa clonal components was associated with lymphoma in 64% of cases.
3383,369,"Disease activity/severity scores at first visit could not predict lymphoma development, nor was the pSS disease course significantly worse in patients with NHL."
3384,369,"CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, no clinical manifestation or disease score could clearly select patients with subsequent lymphoma development."
3385,369,"Presence of IgM-kappa clonal components and development of purpura, PNP, and GN should alert the clinician for the presence of lymphoma."
3386,370,A 52-year-old woman developed abnormal behavior and disturbance of consciousness subsequent to several days with a cold.
3387,370,"On admission, she was very confused, with incoherent speech, and an inability to recognize family faces."
3388,370,"Diffusion weighted MRI showed high intensity signal change in the bilateral medial temporal lobes, including the hippocampus."
3389,370,Cerebrospinal fluid examination was normal.
3390,370,Tests including various viral antibody titers provided no evidence of infection.
3391,370,Several neuronal antibodies including anti-VGKC and -NMDA receptor antibody were absent.
3392,370,Evidence of malignancy was not apparent.
3393,370,"She was diagnosed with acute limbic encephalitis complicated by Sjgren's syndrome (SjS), due to the fact that she had a past history of SjS, elevation of anti-SS-A antibody, pleuritis and pericarditis."
3394,370,"Her symptoms gradually improved after administration of steroids including pulse therapy; however, her amnesia remained for a long time."
3395,370,"In diagnosing acute limbic encephalitis, we should consider SjS as an underlying disease, even though it is rare."
3396,371,PURPOSE: This study aims to address the lack of independent subjective efficacy data on artificial tear substitutes in the treatment of dry eye due to the anecdotal association of 'thicker' products being more effective.
3397,371,METHODS: This is an independent study of the subjective use and efficacy of topical treatments used by members of the British Sjgren's Syndrome Association (BSSA) related to product viscosity.
3398,371,2000 members of the BSSA were sent a questionnaire regarding their physical condition and the use of artificial tear substitutes.
3399,371,Viscosity analysis was performed on the most popular preparations.
3400,371,Statistical comparison is made between subjective efficacies related to substitute tear viscosity.
3401,371,RESULTS: 1088 patients responded giving information regarding their condition together with the subjective use and efficacy data of artificial tear substitutes.
3402,371,Visco-analysis was performed on the most popular preparations; these had more than 50 patients using them.
3403,371,In terms of subjective benefits related to viscosity for 'frequency' and 'duration' the data suggests a general trend toward viscous preparations being instilled less frequently and lasting longer; however this was not shown to be significantly correlated and some interesting comparisons are reported.
3404,371,CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm high levels of ocular lubricant use in the BSSA population.
3405,371,Our data investigates the often-anecdotal evidence that thicker preparations are more effective.
3406,371,"However, we did not find this correlation to be statistically significant suggesting further study into factors related to subjective product efficacy."
3407,371,These results lay foundations for the development of future products in the treatment of severe dry eye.
3408,372,"We report the case of a 40-year-old housewife, who presented with vomiting since past 5 days and weakness of all four limbs since 1 day."
3409,372,Clinical examination confirmed the presence of flaccid quadriparesis with preserved tendon reflexes.
3410,372,Routine laboratory parameters showed severe hypokalaemia.
3411,372,On further evaluation she was diagnosed to have type 1 renal tubular acidosis secondary to Sjogren's syndrome.
3412,372,Sicca symptoms were conspicuous by their absence.
3413,373,"INTRODUCTION: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disorder involving the exocrine glands, which affects 1.9-3.0% of the elderly population."
3414,373,"Approximately 20% of all patients with SS have CNS involvement, including dementia, as a result of angiitis."
3415,373,AIMS: The aim of the study was to clarify the prevalence and impact of SS among patients in a memory clinic.
3416,373,METHODS: This study prospectively recruited patients with cognitive dysfunction in a memory clinic from 2007 to 2010.
3417,373,"In addition to the examinations for dementia, the patients' levels of anti-SSA and SSB antibodies were measured."
3418,373,Schirmer's test and/or a lip biopsy were added if required.
3419,373,SS was diagnosed based on the American European consensus criteria.
3420,373,"RESULTS: Out of 276 cases who completed the examinations, 265 (97/168 males/females, mean age: 77.9, median MMSE score: 23) did not demonstrated cognitive decline."
3421,373,"Sixteen (6.3%) and seven (2.7%) patients were positive for anti-SS-A and SS-B antibodies, respectively."
3422,373,"Twenty patients (7.5%) were diagnosed with primary SS (mean age: 77.2 years old, median MMSE: 21)."
3423,373,"Seven of these patients had previously been diagnosed with MCI (VCIND: 5, aMCI: 2), and 13 had been diagnosed with dementia."
3424,373,"All had asymmetrical focal hypoperfusion on SPECT, and eighteen had subcortical lesions on MRI."
3425,373,"Twelve were treated for dementia (median time: 2.1 years), and their MMSE significantly improved (median MMSE: 26, p=0.0019), while the non-SS subjects' MMSE declined (n=126, median: 22)."
3426,373,"CONCLUSION: The patients with SS accounted for 7.5% of those with a cognitive decline as determined at a memory clinic, and are characterized by subcortical white matter lesions and asymmetric hypoperfusion."
3427,374,"OBJECTIVES: To perform an observational retrospective cross-sectional case-control study to evaluate prevalence, clinical patterns and outcomes of CNS involvement in a large cohort of primary SS (pSS) patients."
3428,374,"METHODS: A total of 424 pSS patients, diagnosed according to the 2002 criteria proposed by the American-European Consensus Group, were checked for CNS involvement after exclusion of secondary causes."
3429,374,"Demographic, clinical, seroimmunological data were compared between patients with and without CNS involvement."
3430,374,Neuroimaging data were also analysed.
3431,374,RESULTS: CNS involvement was detected in 25 (5.8%) patients (24 females and 1 male) both at disease onset (52%) and later (48%) with a mean latency after diagnosis of 7 years.
3432,374,"Diffuse (40%), focal/multifocal (36%), multiple sclerosis (MS)-like disease (20%) and isolated optic neuritis (4%) were the most common CNS clinical pictures."
3433,374,"Disease duration, lung involvement and decreased C(4) were associated with CNS involvement, while articular manifestations were more frequently observed in patients without neurological complications."
3434,374,"Most cases had an acute, often recurrent course with spontaneous remission or only mild neurological impairment."
3435,374,"CONCLUSIONS: CNS involvement represents a rare but not negligible complication of pSS, which may occur with a bimodal temporal pattern, both at onset and later, prompting attention in the differential diagnosis of apparently isolated neurological syndromes."
3436,374,"Lung involvement emerged as the strongest risk factor for CNS involvement with a relative risk of 7.9, along with disease duration and decreased C(4)."
3437,375,OBJECTIVES: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is one of the major systemic manifestations of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
3438,375,The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of rituximab on pSS patients with ILD.
3439,375,"METHODS: Pulmonary function test results, including diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and DLCO/alveolar volume (Va) ratio, and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings/scores in ten pSS patients with ILD treated with rituximab were retrospectively investigated."
3440,375,"Global disease, fatigue, dryness of eyes and mouth, shortness of breath, and cough were assessed by visual analogue scales (VAS, 0-100 mm)."
3441,375,"RESULTS: At 6 months after rituximab treatment, improvement in pulmonary function was observed (from 49.312.6 to 56.911.4% for DLCO, p=0.011; from 74.415.8 to 85.610.3% for DLCO/Va, p=0.021)."
3442,375,"Similarly, significant improvement of subjective symptoms were also noted after treatment (VAS global disease, from 62.011.4 to 26.010.8 mm, p<0.001; VAS fatigue, from 38.023.0 to 18.07.9 mm, p=0.006; VAS dryness of eyes, from 53.024.4 to 29.013.7 mm, p=0.004; VAS dryness of mouth, from 45.014.3 to 28.09.2 mm, p=0.001; VAS shortness of breath, from 64.016.5 to 31.016.0 mm, p<0.001; VAS cough, from 42.023.5 to 18.010.3 mm, p=0.011)."
3443,375,"The mean HRCT score decreased after rituximab therapy although to a lesser extent (from 8.74.1 to 7.64.6, p=0.419)."
3444,375,An adverse event was observed in only one patient who had non-fatal pneumonia 4 months after rituximab infusion.
3445,375,"CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab was effective in improving clinical symptoms and gas exchange, and in stabilising HRCT score in pSS patients with ILD."
3446,376,Cryoglobulins are serum immunoglobulins that precipitate at temperatures below 37 degrees C and re-dissolve on warming.
3447,376,"Cryoglobulinaemia leads to variable symptoms including characteristic purpura, ischaemia of extremities, renal failure, peripheral neuropathy, abdominal pain secondary to intestinal ischaemia and arthralgias."
3448,376,Cryoglobulin testing is underutilized in clinical practice.
3449,376,"It has been neglected in clinical laboratories and by clinicians due to several factors, such as the length of time it takes for serum cryoglobulin analysis to be performed in the laboratory, the perceived difficulty in getting optimal sampling conditions and a failure to appreciate that even apparently low levels of cryoglobulin can be associated with severe symptoms in some patients."
3450,376,The most important variable confounding standardization of cryoglobulin testing is improper sample handling.
3451,376,A recent report critically appraising the current practice of cryoglobulin evaluation in 137 laboratories in Europe by United Kingdom National External Quality Assurance Scheme (UKNEQAS) illustrated the wide variability in practice.
3452,376,"Although many clinical laboratories perform cryoglobulin evaluation, there are widespread differences in the methodology used and the care with which this is carried out and this leads to considerable intralaboratory and interlaboratory variability."
3453,376,The most common sources of error are false-negative results due to loss of cryoprecipitate during transport and storage.
3454,376,Better standardization is needed to avoid missed diagnoses and improve the comparability of results.
3455,376,Laboratories should ensure that sample temperature is maintained at 37 degrees C until the serum is separated.
3456,376,"In this article, we briefly review the classification and clinical features of cryoglobulins and suggest best practice guidelines for laboratory detection and identification of cryoglobulins."
3457,377,"Sjgren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease which targets the salivary and lacrimal glands in particular, causing sicca syndrome."
3458,377,Extraglandular manifestations are often seen.
3459,377,Chronic sialadenitis of the parotid gland is the most common symptom to be assessed for differential diagnosis.
3460,377,"Common HE and Giemsa slices are histopathologically examined and graduated for lymphocyte infiltration (focus): grade 0: absent, grade 1: slight, grade 2: moderate non-focal infiltration, grade 3: 1 focus (> or =50 lymphocytes) per 4 mm2, grade 4: >1 focus."
3461,377,"Grade 3 infiltrates correspond to a focus score of 1, which is one of four disease-classifying criteria acknowledged for diagnosis."
3462,377,"Bioptic examination is also performed to rule out different (non-) immunologic sialadenitises, such as the necrotizing or epithelioid-like form (in sarcoidosis), and the extranodal marginal-zone lymphoma."
3463,377,Extraglandular manifestations of Sjgren's syndrome can also be safely diagnosed by histopathological examination.
3464,377,Emphases lie on vasculitides and myositides.
3465,377,"Bioptic work-up, therefore, is not only reasonable but also an essential tool for diagnostics in Sjgren's syndrome."
3466,378,"BACKGROUND: Sjgren's syndrome can involve the central nervous system; however, spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage has rarely been reported as the initial manifestation."
3467,378,CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 39-year-old woman with primary Sjgren's syndrome presenting with intracranial hemorrhage.
3468,378,"The diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome was based on the presence of ocular dryness, salivary gland secretory and excretory dysfunction confirmed with dynamic tracer emission CT, and positive anti-Sjgren's syndrome A and anti-Sjgren's syndrome B antibodies."
3469,378,"CONCLUSION: Primary Sjgren's syndrome can present with variable central nervous system signs, which may precede the classic sicca symptoms."
3470,378,"Therefore, Sjgren's syndrome-associated indicators should be investigated in patients without the common risk factors for stroke who present with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage."
3471,379,This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of low-dose cyclosporine A (CyA) in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and articular involvement.
3472,379,This phase II open-label clinical study included 30 patients meeting the American-European Consensus group criteria for pSS with active joint involvement under stable symptomatic therapy.
3473,379,Treatment consisted of approximately 2mgkg(-1) body weight of CyAday(-1) over a period of 16weeks.
3474,379,The primary endpoint was defined as a reduction in the number of painful and/or swollen joints at end of treatment (EOT).
3475,379,"Secondary endpoints included the changes in general health, sicca symptoms, European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), arthrosonography, and safety profile."
3476,379,"At baseline (BL), the mean number of tender joints (68 count) was 16.2 (13.2) and at EOT 10.4 (11.9; p=0.002)."
3477,379,The mean number of swollen joints (66 counts) was reduced from 3.2 (3.3) at BL to 1.3 (3.2) at EOT (p<0.001).
3478,379,"Overall, 21 (70%) and 13 (43.3%) patients had a reduction of two or more tender and swollen joints, respectively, in the 68/66 joint counts."
3479,379,The disease activity score (DAS28) showed a statistically and clinically meaningful decrease over the 16-week period of treatment.
3480,379,"Treatment was well tolerated, and adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of CyA (e.g., hypertension, headache)."
3481,379,"In this pilot study, promising effects of low-dose CyA treatment on articular involvement were observed in patients with pSS justifying further controlled studies in this indication."
3482,379,No new or unexpected safety observations were made.
3483,379,"TRIAL REGISTRATION: Low-Dose Cyclosporin A in Primary Sjgren Syndrome (CYPRESS), ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01693393 ."
3484,380,"A 69-year-old hypertensive woman presented with eye and mouth dryness, bilateral parotid gland enlargement, associated with anasarca and proteinuria."
3485,380,"Family history was notable for malignancies including breast, nasopharyngeal and colon cancers."
3486,380,"Physical exam disclosed hypertension, bilaterally enlarged, firm, non-tender parotid glands, fine bibasilar crackles and bipedal edema."
3487,380,"Anti Ro/Sjgren's syndrome antigen A antibody was positive, with negative tests for anti La/Sjgren's syndrome antigen B and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)."
3488,380,Chest radiographs showed basal infiltrates.
3489,380,"Sjgren's syndrome associated with glomerulonephritis and interstitial lung disease was diagnosed, and she received pulse methylprednisololone followed by oral prednisone with dramatic improvement."
3490,380,"Two months later, while on prednisone 5 mg/day, she returned to the clinic with an enlarging fixed non-tender right breast mass."
3491,380,"She underwent modified radical mastectomy of the right breast, and pathologic report revealed diffuse, small cell, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the breast; axillary lymph nodes were negative for tumor."
3492,380,She opted for alternative therapy and did not return to the clinic until 7 months later when she developed sudden monocular blindness in the right eye with no other systemic manifestations.
3493,380,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed swelling and enhancement of intracanalicular and pre-chiasmatic segments of the right optic nerve and right side of the optic chiasm.
3494,380,Considerations were Devic's disease versus metastases.
3495,380,She received pulse methylprednisolone therapy (1 g/day for 3 days) with partial recovery of vision.
3496,380,She is scheduled for lymphoma chemotherapy to include rituximab.
3497,381,BACKGROUND: To evaluate quantitative and qualitative changes in sub-basal corneal nerves (SBN) via in vivo confocal microscopy in patients with Sjgren syndrome dry eye (SSDE) treated with topical cyclosporine A (CsA).
3498,381,"DESIGN: Prospective, observational, non-randomized study."
3499,381,PARTICIPANTS: Thirty eyes of 30 patients with SSDE refractory to conventional treatment treated with CsA 0.05% twice daily for 6months.
3500,381,"Fifteen eyes of 15 healthy, age and gender matched, volunteers constituted the control group at baseline."
3501,381,"METHODS: A clinical evaluation of dry eye, corneal sensation using Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometry and in vivo confocal microscopy analysis of the central cornea were performed prospectively at baseline for all patients, and after 6months of treatment with CsA."
3502,381,"MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Density, number, reflectivity and tortuosity of SBN, dendritic cell (DC) density, esthesiometry, and dry eye signs and symptoms."
3503,381,"RESULTS: Topical CsA 0.05% improved clinical signs and symptoms, and increased corneal sensitivity."
3504,381,"Following treatment, SBN density was significantly increased (P<0.0001) associated with a decreased in DC density (P<0.0001)."
3505,381,"The increase in SBN density after treatment was positively correlated with baseline SBN density (R(2) =0.33; P=0.0008) and negatively correlated with baseline Ocular Surface Disease Index (R(2) =0.28; P=0.002), Oxford score (R(2) =0.31; P=0.002), and DC density (R(2) =0.37; P=0.0003)."
3506,381,"CONCLUSIONS: Topical CsA led to an increase in corneal SBN density, improving clinical signs and symptoms of SSDE."
3507,381,Our results also suggest an improved response to treatment in patients with less initial nerve damage.
3508,382,Novel autoantibodies against nuclear antigen of 14kDa (NA-14)/Sjgren's syndrome nuclear antigen-1 (SSNA-1) are predominantly recognized in sera of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
3509,382,"However, the detailed characteristics of the anti-NA-14 antibody remain unknown."
3510,382,"Here, we sought to clarify the characteristics of anti-SSNA-1/NA-14 antibodies and the mechanisms of autoantibody production using sera from patients with connective tissue diseases (including pSS), autoimmune sera reacting with standard autoantigens (SS-A/Ro and/or SS-B/La, ds DNA, Scl-70 and Jo-1), and normal healthy controls (NHCs)."
3511,382,Anti-NA-14 antibodies were predominantly recognized in sera from patients with pSS and in autoimmune sera reacting with thSS-A/Ro and/or -SS-B/Lo.
3512,382,Indirect immunofluorescence analysis showed that NA-14 was strongly expressed in mitotic-phase cells.
3513,382,Patients with pSS having anti-NA-14 antibodies exhibited significant elevation of serum IP-10 and BAFF compared to that in patients with pSS without anti-NA-14 antibodies and NHCs.
3514,382,"Thus, our data demonstrated that anti-NA-14 antibodies could be classified as novel autoantibodies reacting with mitosis-related autoantigens predominantly recognized in pSS."
3515,382,"Moreover, interferon- played an important role in the production of anti-NA-14 autoantibodies as patients with pSS having anti-NA-14 antibodies exhibited increased serum levels of IP-10 and BAFF."
3516,383,"Scleredema adultorum of Buschke is a rare disorder characterized by diffuse swelling and non-pitting induration of the skin usually involving the face, neck, arms and upper trunk."
3517,383,"It has been associated with previous infectious diseases, diabetes, paraproteinemia and, more rarely, malignant neoplasms or autoimmune disorders."
3518,383,We report the case of a 30-year-old man who presented with a 2-year history of scleredema.
3519,383,Further investigation led to the diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome.
3520,383,The association between scleredema and autoimmune disorders has been rarely seen.
3521,383,"To our knowledge, there are no other reports describing the association between primary Sjgren's syndrome and scleredema adultorum of Buschke."
3522,384,"The aims were to obtain epidemiological and etiological data on xerostomia in cross section of Croatian population, and to evaluate adherence to ""American European Consensus Group"" (AECG) classification criteria for Sjgren's syndrome (SSj), in order to identify possible need for improvements in differential diagnosis of xerostomia."
3523,384,A retrospective study among patients seen at the Department of oral medicine for complaints of dry mouth was performed.
3524,384,Three hundred and ninety-five patients met inclusion criteria.
3525,384,"A data base was formed, comprising epidemiological, clinical and sialometric data, immunological, scintigraphic, ultrasonographic and histopathological findings of salivary glands, coupled with drug intake listings."
3526,384,Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis.
3527,384,Objective salivary hypofunction was found in 74% of our patients.
3528,384,The most common probable cause of xerostomia was side effect of pharmacotherapy.
3529,384,"SSj was diagnosed in 6.7% of patients with xerostomia, whereas in another 8% of patients Sjgren's syndrome was strongly suspected, but labial gland biopsy wasn't performed, indicating a lack of adherence to AECG criteria for SSj diagnosis."
3530,384,"Application of AECG criteria in differential diagnosis of patients with dry mouth is mandatory, as well as educating general practitioners, dentists and patients on xerogenic side effects of pharmacotherapy."
3531,385,Diagnostic and classification criteria for Sjgren's syndrome (SS) continue to evolve as more is learned about SS and about autoimmune diseases in general.
3532,385,"Among diagnostic or classification criteria for SS that are in current use, most include various and variable combinations of results from questions about symptoms and objective tests, many of which are not specific to SS."
3533,385,"Given the rapid increase of genetic knowledge about other autoimmune diseases and the potential of finding and testing new biological agents to treat SS, selection of patients who have as uniform a disease process as possible becomes an important goal to better understand and treat this prevalent autoimmune disease."
3534,385,Such is the goal and promise of the latest entry into the SS classification criteria field.
3535,386,"INTRODUCTION: Fatigue is prevalent in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), and contributes to the considerably reduced health related quality of life in this disease."
3536,386,The symptom is included in proposed disease activity and outcome measures for pSS.
3537,386,Several studies indicate that there is an inflammatory component of fatigue in pSS and other chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
3538,386,"The purpose of this study was to investigate fatigue change in pSS in a longitudinal study, and explore whether any clinical or laboratory variables at baseline, including serum cytokines, were associated with a change in fatigue scores over time."
3539,386,METHODS: A clinical and laboratory investigation of 141 patients fulfilling the American-European consensus criteria of pSS was undertaken in the period May 2004 to April 2005.
3540,386,Median time since diagnosis was 5.5 years.
3541,386,"Examinations included the fatigue questionnaires: fatigue severity scale (FSS), fatigue visual analogue scale (VAS), functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-fatigue (FACIT-F) and medical outcome study short form-36 (SF-36) vitality, which were repeated in a follow-up investigation in January and February 2010."
3542,386,RESULTS: A total of 122 patients (87%) responded at both time-points.
3543,386,Thirty-five percent of patients experienced a clinically significant FSS increase.
3544,386,"On the group level, fatigue measures did not change except that there was a slight deterioration in SF-36 vitality score."
3545,386,"High serum anti-Sjgren's syndrome A antigen (anti-SSA) showed weak associations with high baseline fatigue, and patients with increasing fatigue had lower baseline unstimulated whole salivary volume."
3546,386,"Weak associations between increasing fatigue and serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), and the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17), were observed."
3547,386,Baseline sicca symptoms correlated with higher fatigue both at baseline and with increasing fatigue over time.
3548,386,Linear regression analysis did not identify any predictive ability of clinical or laboratory measures on fatigue change over time.
3549,386,CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue remained mainly unchanged over time.
3550,386,Using multivariate models did not reveal any clinical or laboratory predictors of fatigue change over time.
3551,387,Sjgren syndrome is a slowly progressing autoimmune disease.
3552,387,"Pulmonary manifestations are frequent in primary Sjgren syndrome but often not clinically significant; the most common are xerotrachea, interstitial lung diseases, and small airway obstruction."
3553,387,"Pulmonary manifestations in Sjgren syndrome have a slow progression and favorable prognosis, with the exception of primary pulmonary lymphoma and pulmonary hypertension."
3554,388,Primary Sjgren syndrome is an immune-mediated exocrinopathy characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the salivary and lacrimal glands.
3555,388,"Various systemic extraglandular disorders are associated with primary Sjgren syndrome, and the thorax is commonly affected."
3556,388,"The pulmonary manifestations of primary Sjgren syndrome may be categorized as airway abnormalities, interstitial pneumonias, and lymphoproliferative disorders; in each category, bronchiectasis or centrilobular nodules, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia are common."
3557,388,These manifestations do not usually occur in isolation; they are concomitantly seen with other types of lesions.
3558,388,"Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and amyloidosis are key components of lymphoproliferative disorders, and MALT lymphoma should always be considered because its morphologic characteristics are similar to those of benign lymphoproliferative disorders."
3559,388,"Amyloidosis is rare but important because it carries a risk for underlying MALT lymphoma or plasmacytoma, and it may lead to hemoptysis during biopsy."
3560,388,"In addition, thin-walled air cysts are characteristic of primary Sjgren syndrome, irrespective of the main pulmonary manifestations."
3561,388,Lymphadenopathy and multilocular thymic cysts may be seen in the mediastinum.
3562,388,"During the follow-up period, there is a risk for acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia and development of malignant lymphoma."
3563,388,"Often, primary Sjgren syndrome is subclinical, but there are various underlying risks."
3564,388,"Thus, imaging findings are important."
3565,388,"In addition to the various types of interstitial pneumonia and airway abnormalities, air cysts and mediastinal manifestations may help diagnose primary Sjgren syndrome."
3566,389,BACKGROUND: Cystic lung disease can be seen in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and is generally thought to be due to lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia.
3567,389,"METHODS: Using computer-assisted search we identified patients with primary SS seen at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN during a 14-year period from 1997 to 2010 who were diagnosed with pulmonary amyloidosis confirmed on lung biopsy."
3568,389,"Clinical records, imaging studies, and pathologic specimens were reviewed to delineate presenting features, diagnostic evaluation, and clinical course."
3569,389,"RESULTS: Eight patients (7 women, 1 man) with primary SS were diagnosed with pulmonary amyloidosis by lung biopsy (7 surgical, 1 bronchoscopic)."
3570,389,"Their median age was 55 years (range, 32-75 years) and all were nonsmokers."
3571,389,Presenting symptoms included dyspnea and cough but 4 patients presented with radiologic abnormalities in the absence of respiratory symptoms.
3572,389,CT findings included cystic lesions and nodular opacities in all eight patients.
3573,389,PET scan performed in six patients did not reveal (18)F-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake except in one nodule with borderline uptake.
3574,389,Lung biopsy demonstrated the presence of amyloid in all patients and was associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma in three patients.
3575,389,Pulmonary function results were normal in five patients and revealed mild impairment in a mixed pattern in one patient.
3576,389,CONCLUSIONS: We conclude cystic and nodular lung lesions seen in patients with primary SS can represent amyloidosis which can be associated with MALT lymphoma in some of these patients.
3577,390,"PURPOSE: To compare the clinical presentation of 231 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) with 89 patients with aqueous-deficient dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca; KCS), to determine those procedures that best differentiate these groups in the eye care clinic."
3578,390,METHODS: The records of all patients seen at the University Health Network Sjgren's Syndrome Clinic from October 1992 to July 2006 were reviewed and documented.
3579,390,The diagnosis of pSS was based on the AECC (American European Consensus Criteria) of 2002.
3580,390,KCS control subjects were non-SS patients with symptoms of dry eye and Schirmer scores of <or=10 mm in 5 minutes in at least one eye.
3581,390,There were 90 variables used in the analysis of the total database.
3582,390,Recursive partitioning was used to generate tree diagrams that demonstrated which characteristics best distinguished pSS from KCS.
3583,390,RESULTS: Recursive partitioning of the full database demonstrated that the serum immunoglobulin Ro and the status of the salivary gland biopsy were most important in distinguishing pSS and KCS.
3584,390,The presence of rose bengal staining of the temporal conjunctiva was the most important noninvasive ocular variable that separated the groups.
3585,390,Total rose bengal staining also improved sensitivity.
3586,390,"When only noninvasive techniques were used, staining of the temporal conjunctiva and severity of dry mouth symptoms were the major factors in distinguishing pSS from KCS."
3587,390,CONCLUSIONS: Rose bengal staining of the ocular surface is an important observation in the detection of SS and the differentiation of pSS and KCS.
3588,391,PURPOSE: The Schirmer test is one of the 2 ocular surface tests included in the current classification criteria for Sjgren syndrome (SS).
3589,391,Tear osmolarity may also be a useful test for the diagnosis of dry eye disease.
3590,391,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between tear osmolarity, the Schirmer test I, and dry eye symptoms in SS."
3591,391,"METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of SS were assessed for tear osmolarity with the TearLab Osmolarity System, tear production with Schirmer testing, symptoms with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), and discomfort associated with each test."
3592,391,RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with a mean age of 53.7 years and a female (92%) predominance were enrolled.
3593,391,The majority of patients (86%) were receiving systemic therapy for severe SS.
3594,391,"Higher tear osmolarity was moderately associated with lower scores on the Schirmer test I ( = -0.39, P < 0.01) and OSDI ( = -0.45, P < 0.01)."
3595,391,"Schirmer test I results and lower OSDI scores were not correlated significantly ( = 0.20, P = 0.17)."
3596,391,Tear osmolarity testing was significantly less painful than Schirmer testing (P < 0.01).
3597,391,CONCLUSIONS: Signs and symptoms of dry eye in SS patients were not strongly correlated.
3598,391,An unexpected finding was that higher tear osmolarity was associated with lower symptom severity.
3599,391,Tear osmolarity testing in the clinical setting was feasible and was associated with significantly less discomfort than Schirmer testing in patients with severe SS.
3600,392,"Sjgren syndrome is among the most common autoimmune diseases affecting adults in the United States, and is frequently regarded as an immune-mediated exocrinopathy exclusively causing dry eyes and dry mouth."
3601,392,"However, as a systemic rheumatic disease, there can be various ""extraglandular"" complications."
3602,392,The eclectic permutation of peripheral nervous system (PNS) syndromes which occur in Sjgren patients are among the most common and severe extraglandular complications.
3603,392,"This review article highlights the evaluation, differential diagnosis, immunopathogenic mechanisms, and potential treatment options of these PNS complications encountered by neurologists."
3604,392,The sensory neuropathies constitute the most frequent PNS complication.
3605,392,"Sjgren patients can suffer from severe neuropathic pain, with small-fiber neuropathy causing lancinating or burning pain which can disproportionately affect the proximal torso or extremities, and the face (ie, in a ""non-length-dependent distribution"")."
3606,392,"The technique of skin biopsy, assessing for the intraepidermal nerve fiber density of unmyelinated nerves, provides a useful technique for neurologists to diagnose small-fiber neuropathies, especially when there is such a non-length-dependent distribution."
3607,392,"Other diagnostic techniques (ie, electromyography/nerve-conduction studies, evoked potentials, nerve and muscle biopsy) may be useful in specific subtypes of neuropathies."
3608,392,"A rational approach to treatment requires a careful appraisal of the clinical subtype of the neuropathy, as well as a familiarity with such discriminating immunopathogenic mechanisms."
3609,392,The application of the traditional armamentarium used for neuropathic pain can be especially challenging.
3610,392,"Sjgren patients can suffer from debilitating fatigue, sicca symptoms, and autonomic findings; as such manifestations can be complications of various neuropathic agents, neurologists should understand how to minimize such iatrogenic complications."
3611,392,"Therefore, this article will empower neurologists to more effectively collaborate with rheumatologists, in the diagnosis and treatment of Sjgren patients with PNS complications."
3612,393,Pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with atrial septal defect and various connective tissue disorders.
3613,393,This case describes a 74-year-old woman who presented with symptoms of heart failure and concomitant involvement of salivary glands and keratoconjunctivitis.
3614,393,An echocardiogram demonstrated ostium secundum atrial septal defect with left to right shunt and severe pulmonary hypertension.
3615,393,Laboratory investigations confirmed the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) with positive anti-nuclear factor and centromere SS-A/Ro pattern.
3616,393,Anti-Ro (SS-A) was found positive.
3617,393,Atrial septal defect was closed through transcatheter route with significant improvement in clinical outcome.
3618,393,This case report suggests a possible association of atrial septal defect with primary Sjgren's syndrome in an adult patient.
3619,394,"The purpose of the study described here was to evaluate salivary gland stiffness in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) via acoustic radiation force impulse imaging, including Virtual Touch tissue quantification (VTQ) and Virtual Touch tissue imaging quantification (VTIQ)."
3620,394,"Twenty-one patients with pSS and 11 healthy patients were included, and the paired parotid and submandibular glands of all of the patients were examined using VTQ and VTIQ."
3621,394,Differences between the two groups were compared with independent and paired t-tests.
3622,394,"The VTQ value for the parotid in the pSS group was significantly higher than that obtained for the control group (1.33  0.22 and 1.18  0.04 m/s, respectively, p < 0.01)."
3623,394,The VTIQ values for the parotid and submandibular gland were both significantly higher in the pSS group than in the control group (p < 0.05).
3624,394,"In the pSS group, a positive correlation was observed between the VTQ and VTIQ results for the parotid and submandibular glands."
3625,394,"In summary, the stiffness of the major salivary glands in patients with pSS was increased compared with that of patients with normal glands."
3626,394,This finding indicates that VTQ and VTIQ imaging may be valuable adjuncts to gray-scale ultrasonography for the clinical diagnosis of pSS.
3627,395,Using the European-American classification criteria the diagnosis of autoimmune sialadenitis in Sjgren's syndrome can generally be easily established or excluded.
3628,395,"In addition, sonography performed by the ENT physician is helpful in diagnosing and especially in follow-up screening for MALT lymphomas, which 5%-10% of patients develop."
3629,395,Therapy of sicca symptoms is primarily symptomatic using substitution with fluids and stimulation with oral cholinergic drugs.
3630,395,Corticosteroids and/or antibiotics may play a role in patients with severe inflammatory episodes of autoimmune sialadenitis.
3631,395,Systemic therapy with immunomodulatory drugs such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide is reserved for patients with extraglandular manifestations.
3632,395,"However, the efficacy of this therapy is not proven by clinical studies."
3633,395,"Rituximab, a new monoclonal CD20 antibody, seems to offer the first possibility of a causal therapy, under which the lymphoepithelial lesions in the salivary glands can disappear and saliva production improves."
3634,395,"However, larger clinical studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this new therapy."
3635,395,"Optimal treatment of autoimmune sialadenitis requires interdisciplinary collaboration between ENT physician, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, rheumatologist, ophthalmologist, dentist, and pathologist."
3636,396,"Annular erythema is a term used to identify skin lesions, in which the rash is erythema burgeoning peripherally and outgoing in the center."
3637,396,"In this paper we present the case of 71-year old woman in whom diagnosis of possible causes of the development of annular erythema, led the team to identify primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
3638,396,Annular erythema was diagnosed on the basis of characteristic clinical picture and histopathological examination.
3639,396,Primary Sjgren's syndrome was diagnosed based on diagnostic criteria for primary SS and the exclusion of other autoimmune diseases.
3640,396,The patient in the study were the presence of characteristic subjective symptoms such as eye occurring for many years dry eyes and periodic feeling of sand in the eyes and dry mouth symptoms requiring frequent drinking of liquids to help swallow food.
3641,396,"Changes within the eye was confirmed Schirmer's test, and the seizure of the salivary glands Saxon test."
3642,396,The serum showed the presence of autoantibodies Ro (SS-A) titer > 600 U/ml.
3643,396,The treatment recommended substitution of tears in order to protect the eye and the occasional use of preparations moisturizing mucous membrane of the nose and mouth.
3644,396,"Due to the few reports of coexistence of annular erythema with primary Sjgren syndrome among Caucasians this case deserves special attention and calls for the implementation of diagnostic tests in each case, clinical suspicion of annular erythema in order to determine possible causes for its development."
3645,397,OBJECTIVES: To study signs of obstructive airway disease (OAD) in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) using the forced oscillation technique (FOT).
3646,397,"METHOD: Thirty-seven female pSS patients (median age 64, range 38-77 years) without previous physician-diagnosed OAD, participating in a longitudinal follow-up study of pulmonary function, and 74 female population-based controls (median age 64, range 47-77 years), also without physician-diagnosed OAD, and matched with regard to age, height, weight, and tobacco consumption, were included in the study."
3647,397,"The pSS patients and controls were studied by the FOT, evaluating resistance and reactance of the respiratory system."
3648,397,"RESULTS: pSS patients had significantly increased resistances at 5-25 Hz, decreased reactance at 10-35 Hz, and an increased resonant frequency (Fres) in comparison with controls."
3649,397,"Resistance was correlated negatively and reactance positively to the vital capacity (VC), the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)."
3650,397,"Compared with controls, pSS patients with (n = 14) and without OAD (n = 21), as determined by spirometry, had significantly increased resistances at 5-25 Hz and decreased reactances at 10-35 Hz."
3651,397,"In never-smoking subjects, identical FOT signs were found."
3652,397,CONCLUSIONS: pSS patients showed FOT signs of obstruction affecting both peripheral and central airways.
3653,397,pSS patients without spirometric signs of OAD and never-smoking pSS patients also showed clear FOT signs of obstruction.
3654,397,FOT therefore seems to be a sensitive method for detecting obstruction in pSS patients.
3655,398,Sjgren's syndrome is the most common autoimmune disorder among women.
3656,398,"This chronic, progressive condition targets moisture-producing glands and seriously disrupts quality of life."
3657,398,"With vague symptomatology, individuals frequently delay seeking medical attention and develop systemic organ involvement."
3658,398,"Comprehension of clinical features will assist nurses and nurse practitioners in primary care settings to facilitate diagnosis and supportive therapy, thus reducing the burden of disease."
3659,399,"RATIONALE: Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia (HO) is a metabolic bone disease, exhibiting different etiologies such as genetic mutation, tumor induction, dysimmunity, or renal disease."
3660,399,"Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a connective tissue disorder commonly involving exocrine glands; however kidney involvement is also encountered, leading to abnormal phosphorus metabolism, even HO."
3661,399,"PATIENT CONCERNS: A 47-year-old female patient presented progressively worsening pain in the chest wall, back and bilateral lower extremities as well as muscle weakness was referred to our department."
3662,399,"DIAGNOSES, INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: Due to the laboratory test results, radiographic findings and pathologic results, she was diagnosed with adult-onset HO associated with SS."
3663,399,"She was then treated with alkalinization, steroids, neutral phosphate, calcium supplements together with activated vitamin D. So far, she recovered uneventfully with relieved pain and increased serum phosphorus level."
3664,399,"LESSONS: HO may be secondary to renal tubular acidosis of SS patients, and it might be a diagnostic challenge when the kidney involvement in SS is latent and precede the typical sicca symptoms."
3665,400,A growing body of evidence presents a link between chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases and atherosclerosis.
3666,400,"To evaluate subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in an elderly group of patients with primary Sjgren syndrome compared with a control group matched for age, sex, ethnicity and cardiovascular risk factors, we enrolled 18 patients with Primary Sjgren Syndrome (mean age 65  5.93 SD) and 18 mild Ostheoarthritic patients (mean age 66  5.94 SD) from the outpatient department of Rheumatology, University Campus Bio-Medico, Rome, Italy, matched for age, sex, ethnicity and cardiovascular risk factors."
3667,400,"A duplex Doppler sonographic study of carotids was performed in order to evaluate intima-media thickness (IMT), stiffness and haemodynamic parameters [resistivity and pulsatility indices (RI and PI, respectively)]."
3668,400,"No significant difference was found between primary Sjgren syndrome and control patients in IMT, stiffness and haemodynamic parameters."
3669,400,"The lack of significant difference in subclinical atherosclerosis between elderly primary Sjgren syndrome and control matched patients, indicates that traditional cardiovascular risk factors, immunologic alterations and chronic inflammation do not influence the progression of vascular damage in the carotid circulation of patients with median disease duration of 6.5 years."
3670,401,We describe a 62-year-old woman with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) presenting with tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) and lymphadenopathy mimicking IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD).
3671,401,Computed tomography revealed multiple swollen lymph nodes.
3672,401,Biopsy of the largest lymph node showed reactive lymphadenopathy with dense IgG4 positive plasma cell (IgG4 + PC) infiltration.
3673,401,Renal biopsy showed chronic plasma cell-rich TIN with IgG4 + PC infiltration.
3674,401,This case suggests that Immunoglobulin G4 immunostaining does not always support the diagnosis of IgG4-RD in the differential diagnosis between SS and IgG4-RD.
3675,402,The Sjgren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic inflammation of the exocrine glands with extraglandular manifestations in up to 25% patients.
3676,402,"Renal involvement occurs in 18.4-67% of cases, with tubulointerstitial nephritis being the most frequent pathology."
3677,402,We present the case of a 37 year-old woman admitted because of generalized grade 2 muscle weakness which developed over a week.
3678,402,"We detected: hypokalemia, rhabdomyolysis, urinary pH 6.5, proteinuria and metabolic acidemia."
3679,402,"The laboratory tests suggestive of distal renal tubular acidosis with hypokalaemia led to the diagnosis of lymphoplasmocytic tubulointerstitial nephritis, which was confirmed by renal biopsy, and to a clinical suspicion of Sjgren's syndrome."
3680,402,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome was diagnosed in this patient based on the following criteria: xerophthalmia, xerostomia, sialadenitis, positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies, and absence of criteria for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis."
3681,402,"During hospitalization, the patient developed deep vein thrombosis."
3682,402,Tests showed positive antiphospholipid antibodies and the diagnosis of secondary antiphospholipid syndrome was made.
3683,402,"She was treated with potassium, bicarbonate, steroids, ramipril and warfarin."
3684,402,The authors wish to highlight the extraglandular manifestations and in particular the rarity of hypokalemic paralysis as the presenting manifestation of primary Sjgren's syndrome.
3685,403,Primary Sjgren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease that presents with xerostomia and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (due to chronic lymphocytic inflammation of the salivary and lacrimal glands) and in some cases extraglandular features.
3686,403,"Patients typically have positive antinuclear, anti-Ro, and anti-La antibodies; however, around 20% to 30% do not and are therefore termed seronegative."
3687,403,We present a case of a 58-year-old woman who was originally diagnosed with seronegative Sjgren's syndrome based on the American-European classification system.
3688,403,She had complete resolution of her clinical features on identification and avoidance of relevant contact allergens.
3689,403,"Contact allergy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of seronegative Sjgren's syndrome, especially where atypical features such as facial rash, normal salivary gland imaging, or lichenoid histology exist."
3690,404,"AIM: There is a need for a reliable, noninvasive radiological method for the assessment of salivary gland changes in Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
3691,404,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of elastosonography as a noninvasive, sonographic modality evaluating tissue stiffness for salivary gland involvement in SS."
3692,404,METHOD: We examined the stiffness in parotid and submandibular glands of 23 patients diagnosed with SS and 20 healthy volunteers.
3693,404,Elasticity scores of the salivary glands were classified into four groups according to the degree of the elasticity of the glands.
3694,404,RESULTS: The elasticity scores of the parotid and submandibular glands did not show a statistically significant difference between the patients with SS and the healthy volunteers.
3695,404,"On the other hand, there was a significant relationship between the duration of the symptoms and the elasticity score of the parotid glands and left submandibular glands (P<0.05)."
3696,404,Patients with higher duration of symptoms had higher elasticity scores.
3697,404,"CONCLUSION: The results might suggest that with the progression of the SS, the elasticity scores of the parotid glands increase gradually, indicating that ultrasonic elastosonography has the potential to demonstrate the progression of the disease."
3698,404,The utility of elastosonography in the follow-up of SS needs to be evaluated with larger studies.
3699,405,Primary lymphomas of the salivary glands are rare.
3700,405,It is estimated that they constitute no more than 5% of all lymphomas in different locations.
3701,405,The most common subtype developing in parotid glands is marginal zone B-cell mucosa associated lymphoid tissue type lymphoma (MALT) that belongs to a group of low-grade tumours.
3702,405,There are many factors associated with the incidence of that proliferative process: environmental and infectious agents as well as immune deficiency states.
3703,405,We describe a case of primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the parotid gland arising in the background of previously undiagnosed and untreated Sjgren's syndrome in a 52-year-old woman.
3704,405,"The article concerns a short review of the literature regarding etiology, symptoms, treatment and survival prognosis in that rare disease as well."
3705,405,MALT lymphomas should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of the tumors and swelling of the parotid gland area.
3706,405,"A special, regular monitoring should include all patients with Sjgren's syndrome as those with the proven greater risk of developing that proliferative disease."
3707,405,The role of the laryngologist in the case of MALT-type lymphoma of the parotid gland should focus on a diagnosis and possible tumor cytoreduction with maximal saving of the facial nerve.
3708,405,The essential treatment of this pathology is one of the oncologists and haematologists.
3709,406,OBJECTIVE: In this study we evaluated US as an additional classification item in the ACR classification of SS.
3710,406,"METHODS: Of 581 patients classified as either SS (n = 364) or non-SS (n = 217) based on the minimum requirements of the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) classification, 184 patients (102 SS and 82 non-SS) who had scored two or more positive or two or more negative results according to the ACR criteria were selected."
3711,406,The AECG classification was used as the gold standard.
3712,406,A parotid and/or submandibular gland that was assigned a score G1 was designated as SS positive.
3713,406,We evaluated US alone or with varying combinations of the ACR classification items in the diagnosis of SS.
3714,406,"RESULTS: The ACR criteria diagnosed the 184 patients with 91% sensitivity, 90% specificity and 91% accuracy."
3715,406,"US alone diagnosed the 184 ACR patients with 79% sensitivity, 90% specificity and 83% accuracy, which was comparable to the results of US diagnosis in the AECG cohort (81%, 86% and 83%, respectively)."
3716,406,"Incorporating the US criteria as an alternative to one of the three ACR classification items achieved 89-91% sensitivity, 87-96% specificity and 89% or 92% accuracy, which was comparable to that of the original ACR classification."
3717,406,"Furthermore, kappa analysis indicated that the results of the original ACR and US-replaced ACR classifications matched completely ( = 0.960-0.974)."
3718,406,CONCLUSION: These results suggest that US can be used as an alternative to any of the three ACR classification items.
3719,407,We present a case of a 47-year-old female who presented with sicca symptoms since three months.
3720,407,"As per the Revised International Classification Criteria for Sjgren's syndrome, patient was diagnosed as primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
3721,407,Patients with SS are known to have circulating monoclonal immunoglobulins.
3722,407,Serum electrophoresis revealed M band with serum gamma globulin concentration of 46 g/L.
3723,407,Bone marrow aspiration revealed 28% plasma cells.
3724,407,"In absence of myeloma-related organ damage, a diagnosis of smouldering myeloma (MM) was made."
3725,407,Patient was treated with thalidomide and dexamethasone.
3726,407,Sicca symptoms resolved with anti-myeloma treatment.
3727,407,"Although MM can occur as a complication of SS, MM can also rarely present as SS."
3728,407,"In the present case, the short duration of sicca symptoms and response of these symptoms to anti-myeloma treatment support the diagnosis of MM presenting as SS."
3729,407,The present case highlights the importance of serum electrophoresis in patients presenting as SS.
3730,408,OBJECTIVE: To validate ultrasonographic criteria for examination of the major salivary glands in the diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
3731,408,METHOD: A total of 209 consecutive patients with rheumatic diseases were selected according to the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) classification criteria for SS.
3732,408,"One hundred and fifteen patients had primary SS, 44 had secondary SS, and 50 had sicca symptoms, and 36 subjects served as asymptomatic controls."
3733,408,"This cohort was analysed for size, echogenicity, parenchymal inhomogeneity, focal changes, and posterior borders of the major salivary glands by ultrasonography (US)."
3734,408,A novel US score for parenchymal inhomogeneity (0-12) was assigned and its diagnostic accuracy evaluated.
3735,408,"RESULTS: Ultrasonographic abnormalities of salivary glands were detected in 107/115 (93.0%) patients with primary SS, in 12/44 (27.3%) with secondary SS, in 25/50 (50.0%) with sicca symptoms, and in 4/36 (11.1%) asymptomatic controls."
3736,408,"Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for US inhomogeneity score was highly significant [0.96 +/- 0.01; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-0.99, p < 0.000] for primary SS, with a sensitivity to specificity ratio of 91/83 for parotid and 93/90 for submandibular glands."
3737,408,"Setting the cut-off US inhomogeneity score at 6 resulted in the best ratio of specificity (90.0%) to sensitivity (95.1%), with a positive predictive value of 72% and a negative predictive value of 96%."
3738,408,A US inhomogeneity score >or= 6 was closely correlated with positive biopsy (p < 0.000) and scintigraphy findings (p < 0.000).
3739,408,CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the high diagnostic value of a novel US score for parenchymal inhomogeneity (0-12) that could serve as a useful single US criterion in the evaluation of salivary gland involvement in primary SS.
3740,409,This retrospective study is designed to evaluate the diagnostic value of semi-quantitative parameters of salivary gland scintigraphy (SGS) in Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and explore the relationship between SGS parameters and salivary gland histopathologic manifestations.
3741,409,SGS and labial salivary gland biopsy were performed on 95 SS patients and 36 healthy age-matched and sex-matched volunteers.
3742,409,"Uptake ratios at 15 min (UR(15)) and stimulated excretion fraction (EF) of each parotid and submandibular gland were calculated automatically from SGS; histopathologic grades were classified based on focal lymphocytic infiltration, and biopsy focus scores were calculated simultaneously."
3743,409,"As a result, the UR(15) and EF of each salivary gland in SS patients were significantly lower than that in controls."
3744,409,Multivariate logistic regression equation was: logit p = 6.965 - 1.680  UR(15) of left submandibular gland - 0.040  EF of left parotid gland - 0.050  EF of right submandibular gland.
3745,409,The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve validated high efficiency of this model with the area under curve of 0.911.
3746,409,And logistic regression analysis on combined original and validation cohorts confirmed its diagnostic value.
3747,409,"Moreover, the EF of right parotid gland and both submandibular glands was correlated with histopathologic changes."
3748,409,"Consequently, the semi-quantitative parameters of SGS may be helpful for diagnosing SS; UR(15) of left submandibular gland, EF of left parotid gland, and EF of right submandibular gland are more powerful predictor of SS."
3749,409,"Besides, SGS parameters reflect the degree of salivary gland involvement, severe patients with low parameters would have high histopathologic grades and biopsy focus scores."
3750,410,"OBJECTIVES: Recently, convincing data have been published on the value of salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) in differentiating primary SS from non-immune-mediated sicca syndrome."
3751,410,Limited data are available regarding the diagnostic accuracy of SGUS in distinguishing SS from other rheumatic diseases.
3752,410,The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of SGUS in distinguishing patients with SS from those with xerostomia and/or xerophthalmia and a diagnosis of stable UCTD.
3753,410,METHODS: This cross-sectional study consecutively enrolled 150 patients either diagnosed with SS (as established by the American-European Consensus Group criteria) or affected by UCTD but not SS.
3754,410,"Parotid and submandibular glands on both sides were assessed for size, parenchymal echogenicity and inhomogeneity by means of SGUS, which was performed by a radiologist blinded to the diagnosis."
3755,410,Echostructural alterations of the salivary glands were graded from 0 to 3 (cut-off >2).
3756,410,RESULTS: This study included 109 patients: 55 with SS and 54 with UCTD.
3757,410,Patients with SS showed a higher SGUS score in comparison with those with UCTD [mean 2.2 (s.d.
3758,410,1.8) vs 0.2 (s.d.
3759,410,"0.5), P < 0.0001]."
3760,410,"The SGUS cut-off >2 showed a sensitivity of 65%, a specificity of 96%, a positive predictive value of 95% and a negative predictive value of 73% for SS diagnosis."
3761,410,"A significant correlation was also found between the SGUS score and the minor salivary gland biopsy/focus score (r = 0.484, P < 0.0001)."
3762,410,CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the good sensitivity and the high specificity of SGUS in differentiating SS from other CTDs.
3763,411,A 52-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with right thalamic hemorrhage.
3764,411,"A carotid angiogram revealed occlusion of the terminal portions of the bilateral internal carotid arteries with basal moyamoya vessels, which was diagnosed as moyamoya disease (MMD)."
3765,411,"At 31 years of age, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis because of optic neuritis and myelitis."
3766,411,Paraplegia appeared 14 days after admission.
3767,411,T2-weighted thoracic magnetic resonance imaging revealed a high intensity lesion extending from T4 to T6.
3768,411,Her left upper limb was partially paralytic and her lower limbs exhibited paraplegia and dysesthesia.
3769,411,Anti-aquaporin 4 and anti-Sjgren's syndrome-A and -B antibodies were positive.
3770,411,"The pathogenesis of neuromyelitis optica may be associated with such immunologic factors, but there are no reports of simultaneous presentations of neuromyelitis optica and MMD."
3771,411,Autoimmunity may be associated with the etiology of MMD.
3772,412,PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to use factor analysis to analyze 90 clinical characteristics of a cohort of 231 patients with primary Sjogren syndrome (pSS).
3773,412,METHODS: The records of all patients seen at the University Health Network Sjogren Syndrome Clinic from October 1992 to July 2006 were reviewed and documented.
3774,412,Those diagnosed as pSS by the American European Consensus Criteria of 2002 were included.
3775,412,"The 90 clinical variables, including health history, blood analysis, symptoms of dry eye and dry mouth, salivary flow and biopsy, tear flow and staining, were analyzed by factor analysis."
3776,412,"RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-one patients with pSS charts were reviewed, and 90 variables were recorded."
3777,412,"Factor analysis resulted in three factors: factor 1: ocular surface staining, factor 2: antimicrosomal antibodies and antithyroid antibodies, and factor 3: serum anti-Ro and anti-La."
3778,412,CONCLUSIONS: Ocular surface staining accounted for the greatest variance in this population of patients with pSS.
3779,413,"PURPOSE: To determine the role of Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) in tear meniscus imaging and evaluate its diagnostic significance in Sjgren syndrome (SS), non-Sjgren's aqueous tear deficiency (ATD) and lipid tear deficiency (LTD) patients."
3780,413,METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-six dry eye patients and 174 healthy controls were enrolled in this study.
3781,413,"All subjects were grouped as follows: group A (ATD), group B (LTD), group C (SS) and group D (normal controls)."
3782,413,"All subjects underwent dry eye questionnaire, FD-OCT scanning, tear film break-up time (BUT), corneal fluorescence staining and Schirmer I test (SIT)."
3783,413,"Tear meniscus height (TMH), tear meniscus depth (TMD) and tear meniscus cross-sectional area (TMA) were measured using FD-OCT (RTVue-100)."
3784,413,The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the cut-off point were determined using a logistic regression model.
3785,413,"RESULTS: Mean TMH, TMD, TMA, BUT and SIT of dry eye patients were significantly lower than those of the controls (p < 0.05)."
3786,413,Tear meniscus values were significantly decreased in patients with SS compared with ATD and LTD patients.
3787,413,Tear meniscus values were significantly correlated with clinical examination results in all groups.
3788,413,Accuracy of dry eye diagnosis by FD-OCT is highest in patients with SS and lowest in LTD patients.
3789,413,The clinical diagnostic critical points were quite different between groups.
3790,413,CONCLUSIONS: Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography could provide precise measurement of the tear meniscus with favourable repeatability.
3791,413,Diagnostic significance is more conspicuous in patients with SS.
3792,413,Tear meniscus measurement by FD-OCT is expected to become a valuable technique in ATD dry eye screening and diagnosis.
3793,414,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To characterize clinical, imaging, and sialendoscopy findings in patients with chronic parotitis and multiple parotid calcifications."
3794,414,STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.
3795,414,"METHODS: Clinical history, radiographic images and reports, lab tests, and operative reports were reviewed for adult patients with chronic parotitis and multiple parotid calcifications who underwent parotid sialendoscopy."
3796,414,RESULTS: Thirteen of 133 (10%) patients undergoing parotid sialendoscopy for chronic sialadenitis had more than one calcification in the region of the parotid gland.
3797,414,Seven patients (54%) were diagnosed with immune-mediated disease from autoimmune parotitis (positive Sjgren's antibodies or antinuclear antibodies) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease.
3798,414,The six patients (46%) who did not have an immune-mediated disorder had most calcifications located anterior or along the masseter muscle.
3799,414,Eight of 13 patients (61%) had at least one calculus found in the parotid duct on sialendoscopy.
3800,414,"Four patients (38%) had multiple punctate calcifications within the parotid gland, all of whom had either autoimmune parotitis or HIV."
3801,414,None of the proximal or punctate parotid calcifications posterior to the masseter were visualized on sialendoscopy.
3802,414,CONCLUSIONS: Chronic parotitis in conjunction with multiple parotid calcifications is uncommon and was identified in 10% of our cohort.
3803,414,We contrast two classifications of parotid calcifications: 1) intraductal stones that cause recurrent duct obstruction and are often located within the main parotid duct along or anterior to the masseter and 2) punctate intraparenchymal parotid gland calcifications that are not visualized on sialendoscopy and may represent underlying inflammatory disease.
3804,414,"LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 127:1565-1570, 2017."
3805,415,PURPOSE: The contrast sensitivity (CS) function in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) may be impaired either frequently as a result of dry eye diseases or rarely as a result of optic neuropathy.
3806,415,"In this study, we aimed to evaluate the CS function in pSS patients as well as to assess corneal aberrations and thickness of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL)."
3807,415,"METHODS: Fourteen eyes of 14 pSS patients (pSS group) and 14 eyes of 14 healthy participants (control group) were subjected to assessment of CS at the spatial frequencies of 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 12, and 18 cycles/degree (cpd) using a functional visual acuity contrast test (FACT); measurement of corneal high-order aberrations (HOAs) in terms of coma-like, spherical-like, and total HOAs using Scheimpflug corneal topography; and measurement of the thickness of both the macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (mGCIPL) and pRNFL in all quadrants using optical coherence tomography."
3808,415,None of the participants were under treatment with artificial tears.
3809,415,RESULTS: The results of the CS test did not differ between the 2 groups at all spatial frequencies (p>0.05).
3810,415,"In addition, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of corneal HOAs (p>0.05) and thickness of mGCIPL (p>0.05)."
3811,415,"However, among all quadrants, only the inferior quadrant of pRNFL in pSS patients was statistically significantly thinner than that in the healthy participants (p=0.04)."
3812,415,"CONCLUSIONS: The CS function in pSS patients can be maintained with normal thickness of both pRNFL and mGCIPL and with lack of increased corneal HOAs, which may be present even in the absence of artificial tear usage."
3813,416,BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) is a progressive autoimmune disease that primarily affects exocrine glands.
3814,416,"The clinical presentation of pSS may vary from an asymptomatic condition to severe skin symptom, resulting in a difficult and challenging diagnosis and treatment."
3815,416,"METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report a 47-year-old Chinese woman who lost vision in the right eye for 7 days."
3816,416,She had been misdiagnosed with primary optic neuritis for 3 months.
3817,416,"After 3 months, the results of immunohistochemistry, salivary gland scintigraphy, and antibody tests proved the diagnosis of pSS."
3818,416,"After an IV methylprednisolone treatment for 3 days (1.0g/d), her final visual and perimetry outcome were satisfactory."
3819,416,A review of the relevant English literature based on PubMed encompassing dates up to July 2016 has been discussed.
3820,416,CONCLUSION: Our finding and the literature review suggest that an early treatment may be beneficial but long-term disease may cause permanent irreparable damage.
3821,417,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltration of the exocrine glands.
3822,417,Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is the most common type of renal involvement in pSS.
3823,417,"However, clinically significant renal involvement is uncommon."
3824,417,Granulomatous interstitial nephritis (GIN) is arare histopathological entity characterized by the presence of granulomas against abackground of interstitial inflammation.
3825,417,GIN is not atypical and commonly seen form of TIN in pSS.
3826,417,"Herein, we report on apatient who was concurrently diagnosed with pSS and GIN and was treated successfully with rituximab (RTX)."
3827,417,"pSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of GIN, and RTX may be agood option in the treatment of this patient group."
3828,418,Diffuse infiltrative lymphocytic syndrome is a clinical identity that can be part of the spectrum of Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection.
3829,418,"It is characterized by sicca symptoms, parotid and lachrymal enlargement and extra-articular manifestations."
3830,418,"We report the case of a 60 years old woman with clinical sicca syndrome in association with leukopenia, positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia."
3831,418,In the follow up the patient developed a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue pulmonary neoplasm.
3832,418,"Furthermore, the clinical surveys revealed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive markers."
3833,418,"In this particular case report, we must underline the clinical presentation of a sicca syndrome as a manifestation of the HIV infection, bearing in mind that, frequently, the differential diagnosis from other diseases, namely the Sjgren's syndrome, is a real challenge."
3834,419,"A 65-year-old woman with Sjgren's syndrome presented with recurrent abdominal distension, constipation, weight loss, orthostatic dizziness, loss of sweating and incomplete emptying of the bladder."
3835,419,"Gastrointestinal dilatation but no evidence of malignancy or obstruction was found on CT of the abdomen, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy."
3836,419,Postvoiding residual urine volume was increased.
3837,419,Antiganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody was positive.
3838,419,We diagnosed as autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy.
3839,419,The patient responded to corticosteroid treatment.
3840,419,"One year after treatment, she continued to have mild gastrointestinal symptoms, but overall condition was stable without further intervention."
3841,420,OBJECTIVE: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by exocrine gland inflammation producing clinical symptoms such as dryness of the mouth and eyes.
3842,420,"The reported prevalence of PSS is variable, probably because of different classification criteria used and selection bias."
3843,420,The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of PSS in a well-defined Norwegian Caucasian population using the revised American-European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria.
3844,420,"METHODS: Three hospitals and three private rheumatology practices provide all of the rheumatology services to the local population in Hordaland and Rogaland counties, which included 852 342 Caucasian inhabitants as of 1 January 2009."
3845,420,"Patients on file fulfilling the new revised AECG criteria for PSS were included, and patients with incomplete data were invited to a screening visit."
3846,420,RESULTS: A total of 424 PSS patients were identified.
3847,420,Their mean age was 61.6  13.2 years; 28 (7%) were men and 396 (93%) were women.
3848,420,The point estimate for the proportion of PSS was 0.050% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.048-0.052].
3849,420,"CONCLUSION: The prevalence of PSS in this Norwegian population of Caucasians is lower than previously reported when less stringent criteria for identifying PSS were used, but is in line with more recent studies using the same criteria and methods as in this study."
3850,421,The aim of the study is to evaluate hearing function by extended high-frequency audiometry in primary Sjgren Syndrome (pSS) and to correlate it with disease activity.
3851,421,All patients diagnosed with pSS were recruited within 1year.
3852,421,"Patients underwent otologic evaluation, extended high-frequency audiometry, tympanogram, and the ESSPRI scale evaluation."
3853,421,A total of 63 (60 female and 3 male) patients with mean age 49.59.9years with pSS were included.
3854,421,"We detected a hearing loss prevalence of 95.2% (60 patients) in both ears in very high frequencies (10000-16,000Hz)."
3855,421,The hearing loss of all patients was sensorineural.
3856,421,There was no significant difference between the degree of disease activity and the hearing thresholds.
3857,421,We enrolled 188 subjects with a mean age of 47.209.7years as a healthy control group.
3858,421,We compared the hearing thresholds of both ears of patients with pSS versus the healthy control group and observed a significant difference in frequencies above 500Hz.
3859,421,Sensorineural hearing loss was found in pSS patients in frequencies above 4000Hz.
3860,421,"Sensorineural hearing loss was highly prevalent in pSS patients, predominantly in very high frequencies."
3861,421,We claim that sensorineural hearing loss could be an associated symptom of primary Sjgren syndrome and suggest further research to support this conclusion.
3862,422,"OBJECTIVE: According to international classification criteria (2002) on Sjgren's syndrome, labial pathology was still considered as a major criterion for diagnosis."
3863,422,Standard labial biopsy was hard to be carried out in China.
3864,422,This study is to evaluate whether the invasive labial biopsy could be replaced by noninvasive detection of serum anti-SSA antibody.
3865,422,METHODS: 181 Chinese patients with the initial diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome in Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) were enrolled in Sjgren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA).
3866,422,"All patients received standard labial biopsies (area of salivary gland tissue  4 mm) and focal score (FS) of focal lymphatic sialadenitis were confirmed by pathologists from school of stomatology, University California of San Francisco (UCSF)."
3867,422,"Anti-SSA antibodies in sera of all patients were detected by double immunodiffusion (DID), Western blot in PUMCH and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in central laboratory of SICCA."
3868,422,The correlation between labial pathological findings and serum anti-SSA antibody was studied by chi test and the concordance was calculated by unweighted Kappa.
3869,422,"RESULTS: (1) Bivariate analysis revealed strong associations of FS > 1 with the presence of anti-SSA antibody by DID (83.9% vs 42.0%, P < 0.0001)."
3870,422,The accordance between FS and antibody detection by DID was fine with a kappa value of 0.432.
3871,422,"However, there were 16.1% false-positive antibody reports and 42.0% false-negative antibody reports."
3872,422,"(2) FS > 1 was strongly associated with the presence of anti-SSA antibody by Western blot (83.0% vs 51.7%, P < 0.0001)."
3873,422,But the accordance between FS and antibody detection by Western blot was only fair with a kappa value of 0.316.
3874,422,There were 17.0% false-positive antibody reports and 51.7% false-negative antibody reports.
3875,422,"(3) FS > 1 was strongly associated with the presence of anti-SSA antibody by ELISA (81.5% vs 38.6%, P < 0.0001)."
3876,422,The accordance between FS and antibody detection by ELISA was fine with a kappa value of 0.427.
3877,422,There were 18.5% false-positive antibody reports and 38.6% false-negative antibody reports.
3878,422,"CONCLUSION: In Sjgren's syndrome, labial biopsy with FS > 1 finding is strongly associated with anti-SSA antibody."
3879,422,"Positive results of anti-SSA antibodies by DID or ELISA may indicate FS > 1, thus labial biopsy could relatively be avoided, negative results may need further standard labial biopsy procedure to confirm the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome."
3880,423,Interstitial cystitis is an exceptional entity during primary Sjgren's syndrome.
3881,423,"In this regard, we report the case of a 67-year-old patient in whom initially idiopathic interstitial cystitis revealed primary Sjgren's syndrome after 5 years of evolution in front of xerostomiaa, xerophtalmia and bilateral parotid hypertrophy with histological confirmation at the biopsy of accessory salivary glands."
3882,424,BACKGROUND: To evaluate the tear osmolarity in patients with dry eye syndrome related to primary Sjgren's Syndrome (SS).
3883,424,MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty eyes of 10 patients with dry eye and primary SS (Group 1) and 20 eyes of 20 subjects who do not have dry eye syndrome (Group 2) were included in this cross-sectional study.
3884,424,"In all eyes, ophthalmic examination was performed in the same order: International Ocular Surface Disease Index survey, visual acuity assessment, conjunctival hyperemia scoring, tear osmolarity measurement with TearLab() Osmolarity System, tear film break-up time assessment, corneal fluorescein staining scoring, ocular surface Lissamine Green staining scoring, anesthetized Schirmer test."
3885,424,Dry eye severity was graded according to Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) classification system.
3886,424,"RESULTS: Four eyes with grade 1, four eyes with grade 2, seven eyes with grade 3, and five eyes with grade 4 dryness, according to DEWS system, were included."
3887,424,"The mean tear osmolarity value was 301.911.40 mOsm/L (range: 290-328) in Group 1, and 294.858.33 mOsm/L (range: 283-311) in Group 2 (p=0.03)."
3888,424,"In Group 1, tear osmolarity values were positively correlated with OSDI scores (r(18)=0.55, r(2)=0.31, p=0.01), DEWS classification grades (r(18)=0.73, r(2)=0.54, p<0.01), temporal and total corneal staining scores (r(18)=0.67, r(2)=0.44, p<0.01, and r(18)=0.51, r(2)=0.26, p=0.02, respectively), temporal conjunctival staining scores (r(18)=58, r(2)=0.34, p<0.01); and negatively correlated with anesthetized Schirmer test results (r(18)=-0.62, r(2)=0.38, p<0.01) and TFBUT (r(18)=-0.50, r(2)=0.25, p=0.02)."
3889,424,"CONCLUSIONS: Tear osmolarity values were found to be greater in patients with dry eye syndrome related to primary SS compared to control subjects, and positively correlated with the severity of dry eye."
3890,425,We report 6 patients with an established diagnosis of primary Sjgren syndrome who developed severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) requiring oral disease-modifying antirheumatic drug with or without biologic therapy.
3891,425,Rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed between 14 months and 17 years following initial sicca symptoms.
3892,425,Five patients were female.
3893,425,"Two thirds were seropositive for Sjgren antibody, and 5 of 6 were either rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide positive at the time of RA diagnosis."
3894,425,All had either hand or wrist involvement; one third had nodules.
3895,425,"Although none demonstrated erosion on x-ray, all required methotrexate or leflunomide, and 4 required a biologic agent for the treatment of their arthritis."
3896,425,Primary Sjgren patients may develop RA after a long course of stable Sjgren.
3897,426,"Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an autoimmune disease, uncommon in childhood."
3898,426,"We report a case of SLS in a 10-year-old girl with a history of tumor, calor and rubor in the back of her toes almost every month, which resolved in 4-5 days without therapy."
3899,426,She did not complain of dry mouth or dry eyes.
3900,426,"The laboratory findings showed high inflammation markers, rheumatoid factor 128 IU, Waaler-Rose 256 IU, anti nuclear antibody (ANA) 1/640, SSA (anti Sjogren antigen A) and SSB (anti Sjogren antigen B) positive and hypergammaglobulinemia."
3901,426,"The Schirmer's test resulted to be pathologic, the ultrasonography images and biopsy of minor salivary glands revealed focal periductal lymphocytic infiltrate and sialoduct ectasia class IV of juvenile Sjogren syndrome."
3902,426,The juvenile Sjogren syndrome is frequently under-diagnosed.
3903,426,"Clinical manifestations in children might be different from the adult form, although laboratory findings may be similar to those found in adults."
3904,427,We herein report the case of a female with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) complicated with trigeminal nerve palsy.
3905,427,"Although her sicca symptoms had been unnoticed, head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detecting brain abnormalities revealed parotid gland changes associated with SS."
3906,427,SS should be considerd as a possible cause of trigeminal nerve disturbances.
3907,427,"In addition, parotid gland changes related to SS should be aware in examination of cranial nerve disturbances with MRI."
3908,428,"OBJECTIVE: The development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) confers a high risk of mortality in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients, but the sensitivity and specificity of proposed lymphoma predictors are insufficient for practical use."
3909,428,The performance of lymphoid organisation in the form of germinal centre (GC)-like lesions was evaluated in labial salivary gland biopsies taken at pSS diagnosis as a potential lymphoma-predicting biomarker.
3910,428,METHODS: Labial salivary gland tissue biopsies available from two Swedish pSS research cohorts (n=175) were re-evaluated by light microscopy in a blind study in order to identify GC-like structures as a sign of ectopic lymphoid tissue formation and organisation.
3911,428,A linkage study was performed with the Swedish Cancer Registry for lymphoma identification.
3912,428,The risk of developing NHL in GC-positive patients in comparison with GC-negative patients was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier statistics and log-rank test.
3913,428,Associations between GC-like structures and clinical and/or laboratory disease markers were also determined using (2) or Fisher's exact tests.
3914,428,"RESULTS: At diagnosis, 25% of pSS patients had GC-like structures in their salivary glands."
3915,428,"Seven of the 175 patients studied (14% GC+ and 0.8% GC-) developed NHL during 1855 patient-years at risk, with a median onset of 7 years following the initial diagnostic salivary gland biopsy."
3916,428,Six of the seven patients had GC-like structures at diagnosis; the remaining patient was GC negative at the time of diagnosis (p=0.001).
3917,428,CONCLUSIONS: The detection of GC-like structures by light microscopy in pSS diagnostic salivary biopsies is proposed as a highly predictive and easy-to-obtain marker for NHL development.
3918,428,This allows for risk stratification of patients and the possibility to initiate preventive B-cell-directed therapy.
3919,429,Findings of specific antibodies and histopathology data are essential for the diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome (SS).
3920,429,"Although the minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) is technically simple, it needs to be performed in a medical institution to avoid complications."
3921,429,OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of complications and the usefulness of this technique.
3922,429,MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent a minor salivary gland biopsy for a possible diagnosis of SS at Rivadavia Hospital between October 2007 and May 2010 where included.
3923,429,The patients were seen a week and a month after the procedure for follow up.
3924,429,"RESULTS: Frequency of acute complications (n=186): 15 patients; 8.1%, 95% CI: 4.7-13.2 (Bleeding 7.5%, syncope 3.2%, hematoma 2.7%."
3925,429,No accidents occurred).
3926,429,"Medium term complications (n=164): 16 patients: 9.75%, 95% CI: 5.9-15.6 (pain 7.32%, inflammation 3.66%, sensitivity disorders 3.05%, granuloma 1.22%,)."
3927,429,No infections or suture dehiscence occurred.
3928,429,"Microscopic results: 154 biopsy reports were received: glandular 90.9%, 95% CI: 85-95 (typical, sialadenitis, grade III and IV infiltration)."
3929,429,CONCLUSIONS: MSGB has very low frequency of medium term and acute complications and it has high usefulness.
3930,430,"Anti-Ro autoantibody is associated with Sjgren's syndrome (SS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and neonatal lupus syndrome (i.e., congenital complete heart block in newborns)."
3931,430,"Generally, the adult atrioventricular (AV) node is believed to be relatively resistant to the scarring effects of anti-Ro/anti-La autoantibodies."
3932,430,"However, there have been some reports of adult complete AV block in SS and SLE patients."
3933,430,"Here, we report a case of complete heart block in primary SS with anti-Ro autoantibodies, with no other risk factor for the development of heart block, and review their etiological association."
3934,431,"OBJECTIVES: Several histological scoring systems, including the focus score, performed in minor salivary glands (MSGs) by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, have been employed in clinical practice to assess the inflammatory infiltrate and provide the diagnosis of primary Sjogrens syndrome (pSS)."
3935,431,Aims of this study were to integrate different scoring systems and identify potential differences in the molecular profile of lymphoid cytokines related to germinal center (GC) formation and clinical subsets in pSS.
3936,431,"METHODS: Overall, 104 pSS patients and 40 subjects with sicca non-pSS were retrospectively evaluated."
3937,431,"MSG biopsies were evaluated by H&E and immunofluorescence to assess histological pattern, Chisholm and Mason grading system, Tarpley score, a grading for the severity of inflammatory infiltrate, T-/B-cell segregation, and the presence of GC."
3938,431,"MSGs from 50 pSS patients and 30 sicca non-pSS patients were processed by real-time PCR to assess LT, LT, BAFF, CXCR4, CXCL12, CXCR5, CXCL13, CCR7, CCL19, and CCL21."
3939,431,"RESULTS: GCs presence was associated with anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies, hypergammaglobulinemia, salivary gland swelling, higher Tarpley score and focus score, and extraglandular involvement but, at multivariate analysis, only extraglandular involvement was independently associated to GC."
3940,431,pSS patients displayed higher level of all cytokines compared to those with sicca symptoms.
3941,431,GC(+) pSS patients displayed higher level of all cytokines compared to those GC(-).
3942,431,"CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that different histopathological patterns, including GC presence, reflect different cytokine expression and different clinical subsets."
3943,431,We believe that the combined immunofluorescence/molecular approach in MSGs would help to tailor diagnostic and therapeutic approach for different subsets of pSS patients.
3944,432,"A 68-year-old female patient with Sjgren syndrome was admitted with asthenia, anorexia and weight loss."
3945,432,"On the third day of admission, she developed severe hematemesis."
3946,432,"Urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE) showed multiple gastric and duodenal ulcers, some with active bleeding requiring endoscopic therapy."
3947,432,The anatomopathologic examination was compatible with gastric and duodenal infiltration by a diffuse CD20+ large B cell lymphoma with germinal center B cell-like morphology.
3948,432,"And the patient was referred for chemotherapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone."
3949,432,"Although seldom observed, the risk of lymphoma in Sjgren syndrome is up to 44 times higher than the general population and rises 7 years after diagnosis."
3950,432,We present a brief case report with interesting iconography.
3951,433,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an uncommon, serious disease that involves multiple organs and is rapidly fatal if left untreated."
3952,433,"TTP is associated with multisystem symptoms, such as thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal impairment, central nervous system involvement, and fever."
3953,433,TTP is idiopathic in about 37% of the cases and can be associated with autoimmune diseases in 13% of the cases.
3954,433,Autoimmune disease-associated TTP can be refractory to plasma exchange and requires immunosuppressive therapy.
3955,433,"We report a case of a previously healthy 55-year-old African American female who presented with shortness of breath, hemolytic anemia, renal impairment, and thrombocytopenia."
3956,433,"The diagnosis of TTP was made, and plasmapheresis was initiated."
3957,433,"However, recurrence happened 48 hours after plasmapheresis was stopped."
3958,433,"Autoimmune workup for refractory TTP revealed positive antinuclear antibodies, Anti-SSA, and Anti-SSB."
3959,433,Lip biopsy revealed findings consistent with Sjogren syndrome.
3960,433,"Treatment with Rituximab was started, and significant clinical and laboratory response was achieved."
3961,433,The patient remained asymptomatic thereafter.
3962,433,"A high clinical suspicion of autoimmune diseases is important as TTP tends to be refractory to plasma exchange in these cases, and immunosuppressive therapy is a key."
3963,434,The objective of the study is to compare the longitudinal performance of different classification criteria for primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in a cohort of patients previously diagnosed with primary SS.
3964,434,"In each patient, we repeated diagnostic tests as required by the Copenhagen, European, Californian, and American-European Consensus Group (AECG) or the new American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria."
3965,434,Sixty-three out of 90 eligible patients (70%) consented to participate.
3966,434,"During the follow-up (mean (standard deviation, SD) 7.6years (0.5)), we observed evolution from primary SS to SS with another systemic autoimmune disease (SAD) in 9/63 (14%) patients, on average after 4.0years (SD 0.9)."
3967,434,"The evolution from primary SS to SS-SADs was significantly more common if the diagnosis of primary SS was initially made using AECG (17%, p=0.008) or ACR (16%, p=0.016) criteria."
3968,434,"In the 34 patients who underwent a full diagnostic reassessment, the diagnosis retention rate was statistically significant for all the criteria, except the European criteria."
3969,434,"At reassessment, 3/32 (9%) patients initially diagnosed as having primary SS using the European criteria could not be classified as having primary SS by any of the criteria."
3970,434,The differences in classification when using the AECG and the new ACR criteria were not statistically significant.
3971,434,The longitudinal diagnosis retention rate was highest for the Californian and AECG criteria.
3972,434,"Regardless of the classification criteria, some patients eventually develop another SAD."
3973,435,The prevalence of abnormalities on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) varies in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients and they are generally multiple hyperintense areas in the subcortical and periventricular white matter on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences.
3974,435,"Here, we report brainstem involvement in a patient with pSS that was extensive on MRI, but reversible."
3975,435,The patient's outcome was positive.
3976,435,"To our knowledge, a similar case has not previously been described."
3977,436,OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of rituximab in central nervous system (CNS) manifestations of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
3978,436,METHODS: Prospective data from patients with pSS and CNS involvement included in the French AutoImmunity and Rituximab registry were analysed.
3979,436,All patients had diffuse white matter T2-weigted hypersignals.
3980,436,Neurological response was defined as improvement or disappearance of neurological signs.
3981,436,RESULTS: Eleven patients (mean age 55 years [38-77]) were treated with rituximab for their neurological involvement.
3982,436,The mean duration of pSS was 9 years (4-24).
3983,436,Mean baseline ESSDAI score was 17 (5-25).
3984,436,"Neurological features were progressive multiple sclerosis-like manifestations (n=6), transverse myelitis (n=1), anxiety and depression disorder (n=1) and cognitive dysfunction (n=3)."
3985,436,Mean Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) before rituximab was 4 (3-5.5).
3986,436,The mean follow-up was of 13 months (6-58).
3987,436,"No neurological change occurred in all 6 patients with multiple sclerosis-like symptoms, in 2/3 patients with cognitive dysfunction or in the patient with anxiety-depression."
3988,436,One patient with depression and cognitive dysfunction disclosed subjective improvement.
3989,436,"One patient with transverse myelitis, refractory to cyclophosphamide had an improvement of his walk perimeter (160 meters vs. 116)."
3990,436,Mean EDSS score and ESSDAI remained stable.
3991,436,CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab does not seem to be effective in progressive multiple sclerosis-like manifestations of patients with pSS-related CNS involvement.
3992,437,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) may be complicated by neurological manifestations.
3993,437,We herein report three women (age range 26-60 years old) who all presented with limbic encephalitis (LE) as the predominant clinical feature 3 months to 15 years after the diagnosis of SS.
3994,437,The 26-year-old patient also developed acute motor axonal neuropathy one week after autoimmune encephalitis.
3995,437,"All three patients showed contrast-enhanced MRI lesions and inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid findings, while not displaying any anti-neuronal antibodies and showing a remarkable response to immunotherapy."
3996,437,SS is often overlooked when the symptoms are mild.
3997,437,"Therefore, in LE cases with no identifiable cause, serological screening for rheumatologic disorders is recommended."
3998,438,"Sweet disease (SD) is a multisystem inflammatory disorder characterised by fever, cutaneous erythematous plaques and aseptic neutrophilic infiltration of various organs."
3999,438,Neuro-Sweet disease (NSD) is a known rare central nervous system complication of SD.
4000,438,We describe a case of a 39-year-old Japanese woman who was diagnosed as NSD associated with Sjgren's syndrome.
4001,438,She was successfully treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy.
4002,439,INTRODUCTION: Interstitial lung disease associated with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS-ILD) shows several patterns such as nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).
4003,439,"Although UIP is a well-recognized prognostic determinant in idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, whether this is also the case in pSS-ILD is unclear."
4004,439,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prognostic effect of UIP, and to identify the prognostic factors in pSS-ILD."
4005,439,METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records identified 33 consecutive patients with pathologically-proven pSS-ILD.
4006,439,Each patient was classified into each ILD pattern by multidisciplinary analysis.
4007,439,Baseline clinical-radiologic-pathologic characteristics and survival rates were compared between the ILD patterns.
4008,439,"Finally, the prognostic factors in pSS-ILD were assessed by univariate and subsequent multivariate analyses using Cox's proportional hazards regression model."
4009,439,RESULTS: pSS-ILD patients were diagnosed with NSIP (n = 22) or UIP (n = 11).
4010,439,"The median follow-up period was 110 months, and five-year survival rate was 87.3% in the total patient population."
4011,439,"The prognosis of the UIP patients was not significantly different from that of the NSIP patients (NSIP to UIP, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.18-3.36, P = 0.73)."
4012,439,"Multivariate analysis identified PaCO2 (HR: 1.68 per 1 Torr increase, 95% CI: 1.24-2.28, P < 0.01), extent of reticular abnormality on high-resolution CT (HR: 4.17 per 1-grade increment, 95% CI: 1.18-14.73, P = 0.03), and severity of fibroblastic foci (HR: 9.26 per 1-grade increment, 95% CI: 1.74-49.35, P < 0.01) as prognostic factors in pSS-ILD."
4013,439,CONCLUSIONS: UIP in pSS-ILD was not related to poorer prognosis than NSIP.
4014,439,Assessment of detailed clinical-radiologic-pathologic findings is more important than distinguishing UIP to evaluate prognosis in this disease.
4015,440,Ocular and oral dryness are the hallmark of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
4016,440,"However, SS can be associated with a variety of complications, affecting organs such as the liver, kidneys, lungs, muscle, and nervous system."
4017,440,Renal involvement has been usually in the form of tubulointerstitial nephritis.
4018,440,"However, glomerulonephritis is rare in primary SS."
4019,440,"We report three clinical cases of SS with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-mediated crescentic glomerulo-nephritis treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide, with favorable outcome."
4020,441,Primary Sjgren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease presenting classically as keratoconjunctivitis sicca.
4021,441,"Renal involvement in Sjgrens's syndrome is less common, and the initial presentation with renal complications without any sicca symptoms is extremely rare."
4022,441,"The renal involvement may present with symptoms arising from interstitial nephritis, mainly distal renal tubular acidosis."
4023,442,"Meningitis is the main manifestation of cryptococcosis in adult systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and other organs and systems, such as the lungs, are rarely affected in this fungal infection."
4024,442,"To our knowledge, no case of pulmonary cryptococcosis has been described in the pediatric lupus population."
4025,442,"Therefore, we report herein one patient with childhood SLE (C-SLE) and Sjgren's syndrome overlap that presented encapsulated Cryptococcus yeast cells in lung tissue."
4026,442,A 14-year-old girl was diagnosed with C-SLE.
4027,442,"At the age of 16 years and 5 months, she presented with fever, cough and dyspnea, without headache, vomiting, and also without signs of meningeal irritation or other clinical manifestations."
4028,442,"She was being treated with mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine and prednisone."
4029,442,Chest radiography and chest computer tomography showed a single nodule in the left posterior apex and three nodular lesions in the left hemithorax respectively.
4030,442,Bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy were normal and without isolation of bacteria or fungi.
4031,442,Voriconazole was empirically introduced for 21 days.
4032,442,"Fifteen days after the first biopsy, she underwent open thoracotomy with surgical left lung biopsy and was diagnosed with pulmonary cryptococcosis."
4033,442,Voriconazole was replaced with oral fluconazole and this antifungal therapy was maintained with improvement of clinical manifestations and without marked alteration of radiological images.
4034,442,"In conclusion, we report the first case of pulmonary cryptococcosis in Sjgren's and C-SLE patient with a satisfactory clinical response to antifungal therapy."
4035,442,Fungal infections should be excluded in the presence of lung nodules and etiological identification is required for proper treatment.
4036,443,"Not only in the context of clinical trials in particular, but also in daily clinical practice, outcome parameters or measuring instruments are essential to assess the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention, its influence on disease activity and potentially also to predict further disease course."
4037,443,Such criteria can assist in the identification of patient risk groups that may require special checkups or interventions.
4038,443,"Moreover, these parameters should be reliable, objective and valid, e.g."
4039,443,to allow comparison of results from different studies.
4040,443,"Therefore, outcome parameters need to be developed and/or validated in a targeted manner for individual diseases or investigations."
4041,443,"To date, we have only limited therapeutic options for Sjgren's syndrome, a frequent systemic autoimmune disorder of unknown origin."
4042,443,"Against the background of the new therapy approaches expected, this article provides a critical overview of available and newly developed outcome parameters for patients with Sjgren's syndrome."
4043,444,OBJECTIVE: To assess salivary gland ultrasonography (US) as a diagnostic tool for secondary Sjgren syndrome (sSS) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
4044,444,METHODS: Salivary gland US images from 30 patients with RA were graded using a validated semiquantitative scoring system.
4045,444,"Sicca symptoms, oral health, and RA disease activity were assessed."
4046,444,RESULTS: US changes consistent with SS were found in 40% of patients.
4047,444,Patients with higher US scores had more sicca symptoms as well as higher RA activity and poorer oral health.
4048,444,CONCLUSION: Salivary gland US may aid the diagnosis of sSS in patients with RA.
4049,445,"A 61-year-old man developed subacute progressive dementia, general fatigue, a tonic-clonic seizure, and a decreased level of consciousness."
4050,445,He had a past history of chronic hepatitis type C and was diagnosed as having hepatic encephalopathy due to hyperammonemia.
4051,445,His level of consciousness did not improve even though the serum ammonia level improved.
4052,445,"In addition, he had repeated general myoclonic seizures."
4053,445,"Head MRI (diffusion-weighted imaging) showed high signal intensities in the right thalamus and the cerebral cortices in the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes (predominantly on the right side)."
4054,445,An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed periodic lateralized epileptic discharges (PLEDs).
4055,445,Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed high total tau protein and 14-3-3 protein levels.
4056,445,This case was diagnosed as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) based on these clinical data.
4057,445,"However, the patient gradually improved without specific treatment."
4058,445,"The differential diagnosis was reconsidered, and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and positive serum anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibodies were noted."
4059,445,A diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome (SjS) was finally made based on a biopsy of a minor salivary gland showing infiltration of lymphocytes around the gland ducts.
4060,445,"Steroid therapy (prednisolone 40mg/day orally) was given, and his clinical condition improved."
4061,445,"The lesions on the head MRI decreased, and the EEG findings normalized."
4062,445,"This case suggests that SjS has a wide spectrum, including neurological disorders, and that SjS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of CJD."
4063,446,"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate endothelial functions in primary Sjgren syndrome."
4064,446,METHODS: Thirty-five patients with primary Sjgren syndrome and 20 age and sex-matched healthy volunteers were recruited to the present study.
4065,446,Flow mediated dilatation of brachial artery and carotid intima-media thickness were measured in the study population.
4066,446,"RESULTS: Carotid intima-media thickness values were similar between groups (0.50 +/- 0.10, 0.53 +/- 0.08, p > 0.05)."
4067,446,"Flow mediated dilatation of the brachial artery was disrupted in the primary Sjgren syndrome group (7% vs 12%, p = 0.002)."
4068,446,"CONCLUSION: There is endothelial dysfunction in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome, although they had comparable carotid intima-media thickness with the healthy control group."
4069,447,"Osteomalacia is a relatively common condition, which is frequently underdiagnosed due to lack of clinical suspicion and non-specific symptoms."
4070,447,Osteomalacia can complicate tubulo-interstital nephritis.
4071,447,"However, it occurs exceptionally as the first manifestation of Sjgren syndrome with renal involvement."
4072,447,It is a consequence of chronic metabolic acidosis and is associated with distal renal tubular acidosis.
4073,447,We report a 31-year-old woman hospitalised for a 1 year history of muscle weakness and joint and chest wall pains.
4074,447,Skeletal imagery showed Looser's zones in the left femoral neck.
4075,447,Investigations concluded to the diagnosis of primary Sjogren's syndrome.
4076,448,A 31-year-old female teacher presented with a 6-month history of progressive hoarseness.
4077,448,The rigid laryngeal endoscopy showed corresponding transversal cream-yellow nodular lesions in the submucosal space of the middle third of both vocal folds.
4078,448,These are characteristic for bamboo nodes which are rare and strongly associated with autoimmune disease.
4079,448,In the present case a hitherto undiscovered Sjgren syndrome was diagnosed.
4080,448,"After surgical excision, local steroid therapy and voice training a considerable voice improvement could be achieved."
4081,449,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate two different ways of measuring unstimulated and stimulated whole salivary output in the dental clinic, namely by volume (mL/min) and by weight (g/min)."
4082,449,MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients diagnosed with Secondary Sjgren's syndrome (SSS) participated in the study.
4083,449,"RESULTS: The results showed a large discrepancy between the measurements performed by volume and by weight (p < 0.001) and additionally when taking into account density calculation, especially in individuals with low salivary secretion rate."
4084,449,"CONCLUSION: It is suggested that weight measurement of saliva should be more routinely implemented, especially in patients with reduced salivary secretion."
4085,450,"Patients with Sjgren's syndrome frequently have pulmonary involvement, but the involvement of nodular pulmonary lesions, including pulmonary amyloidosis, is rare."
4086,450,"Most cases of pulmonary amyloidosis involve multiple nodules; solitary pulmonary nodular amyloidosis, as an associated condition of Sjgren's syndrome, is very rare.In our report, we present the case of an 80-year-old female with Sjgren's syndrome who was incidentally found to have a small solitary pulmonary nodule."
4087,450,The nodule showed high fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and contained areas of calcification.
4088,450,"Because the probability that the nodular lesion was malignant could not be excluded, the tumor was excised using a thoracoscopic procedure; the final diagnosis was pulmonary nodular amyloidosis."
4089,450,"Although most cases of pulmonary amyloidosis involve multiple nodules, amyloidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis for a solitary pulmonary nodule in patients with Sjgren's syndrome."
4090,451,PURPOSE: To determine whether intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could detect parotid gland abnormalities in Sjgren's syndrome (SS) patients who were not identified by conventional MRI.
4091,451,MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with clinically proven SS who were not identified by conventional MRI were assessed by IVIM MRI with a 3.0T MRI scanner.
4092,451,"Quantitative parameters (tissue diffusivity, D; pseudodiffusion coefficient, D*; perfusion fraction, f) derived from IVIM MRI were compared between the SS group and healthy control group (n=15)."
4093,451,A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of each significant parameter.
4094,451,"RESULTS: Excellent inter- and intrareader agreements were obtained during the measurement of D, f, and D* values (interreader, 0.980, 0.942, and 0.883; intrareader, 0.991, 0.952, and 0.896, respectively)."
4095,451,"All three parameters of the SS group were significantly higher than those of the healthy group (D, 1.0490.056  10(-3) mm(2) /s vs. 0.9760.116  10(-3) mm(2) /s, P=0.012; D*, 20.4101.786  10(-3) mm(2) /s vs. 18.7642.433  10(-3) mm(2) /s, P=0.013; f, 0.2070.003 vs. 0.1820.002, P=0.004)."
4096,451,"ROC analysis showed that the f value had the best diagnostic performance (AUC, 0.712; Sensitivity, 0.80; Specificity, 0.57; Cutoff value, 0.185) in detecting the parotid gland abnormalities in early SS patients."
4097,451,CONCLUSION: IVIM MRI detected parotid gland abnormalities in early-stage SS patients.

4101,452,There is a crucial need for reliable diagnostic criteria for SS.
4102,452,"Our objective was to evaluate the frequency of xerosis in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS), and compare histopathology of cutaneous sweat glands and labial salivary glands (LSGs), with respect to their contribution to the diagnosis."
4103,452,Twenty-two patients with primary SS and 22 matched normal volunteers were invited to rate their skin dryness on a visual analog scale.
4104,452,"The skin was dryer (58.3  10.1 versus 38.9  7.6, P < 0.01), and xerosis more frequent (9 of 22 versus 2 of 22, P < 0.02) in the patients than in the controls."
4105,452,The axilla skin was chosen for a 6-mm punch biopsy.
4106,452,Lymphocytic infiltration was seen in the skin of 8 of the 12 patients tested.
4107,452,Two of them had normal LSGs.
4108,452,"Most interestingly, B cell infiltrates were identified in patients' skin infiltrates, so that their presence might be a clue to the diagnosis of primary SS."
4109,452,These cell aggregates associated memory CD10-/CD20+/CD27+/IgD- B lymphocytes and immature CD20+/CD24 + lymphocytes.
4110,452,These latter findings strongly suggest that skin biopsies warrant inclusion into the routine clinical care of patients suspected of suffering from primary SS.
4111,453,Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that mainly affects the exocrine glands and usually presents as persistent dryness of the mouth and eyes.
4112,453,Lung disease in SjS has been reported to occur early following clinical presentation of the disease.
4113,453,"In this study, technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (Tc-99m DTPA) aerosol inhalation scintigraphy was used to assess the pulmonary membrane permeability in patients with primary SjS."
4114,453,A total of 18 patients with primary SjS and 13 healthy controls were investigated.
4115,453,"Clinical evaluation, chest X-ray examination, pulmonary function tests, Tc-99m DTPA aerosol scintigraphy were performed in all the cases."
4116,453,"The presence of respiratory symptoms (dyspnea and cough), duration of sicca symptoms were recorded."
4117,453,The clearance half time of Tc-99m DTPA radioaerosols in patients with SjS (20.49 +/- 2.56 min) was faster when compared to normal controls (42.32 +/- 13.28 min) (P = 0.000) which means that there is a significant increase in lung permeability in patients with SjS compared to the controls.
4118,453,There is also a significant difference between PI of patients with SjS (0.34 +/- 0.09) and that of controls (0.42 +/- 0.07) (P = 0.012).
4119,453,"According to the results of our preliminary study, one can detect pulmonary involvement by Tc-99m DTPA aerosol inhalation scintigraphy in patients with primary SjS."
4120,454,"Sjgren's syndrome is an important differential diagnosis in patients with sensory neuronopathy because immunosuppressive therapy may prevent progressive degeneration of sensory fibres, ganglions and axons."
4121,454,Due to the challenges in the diagnostic process the diagnostic criteria have repeatedly changed over the past few years.
4122,454,"In patients with negative antibodies (SSA, SSB antibodies) biopsy of the salivary glands of the lip and the parotid gland can be useful to diagnose Sjgren's syndrome."
4123,454,We report on four patients in whom biopsy of the salivary gland was helpful in establishing the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome and consequently immunosuppressive therapy was initiated.
4124,454,One of these patients suffered from hypersalivation.
4125,454,This was probably due to denervation hypersensitivity.
4126,454,To our knowledge this has not been reported yet.
4127,455,"A 13-year-old Pacific Island girl presented complaining of fever, joint pain and dry mouth."
4128,455,She was using limes to relieve her dry mouth.
4129,455,"On examination, the most striking clinical finding was severe dental erosion and caries."
4130,455,Autoimmune serology confirmed a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with possible Sjgren's syndrome.
4131,455,The case illustrates the devastating consequence of excessive consumption of acidic citrus juice in sicca syndrome.
4132,456,"A 71-year-old woman developed advanced thermal hypoalgesia, bathyesthesia, and significant sensory ataxia 1 year ago."
4133,456,She also had difficulty maintaining a sitting posture.
4134,456,Patchy and reduced thermal nociception corresponding to a dermatome was found in her four extremities and trunk.
4135,456,"On the basis of several tests, she was diagnosed with ataxic sensory neuronopathy due to dorsal root ganglionitis associated with Sjgren's syndrome."
4136,456,"Generally, dorsal root ganglionitis associated with Sjgren's syndrome is refractory."
4137,456,"After treatment with simple plasmapheresis, she was able to maintain a sitting posture."
4138,456,"Finally, her symptoms stabilized after the inclusion of oral D-penicillamine to her treatment regimen."
4139,456,"Although the clinical course was observed for about one year, we report this case because of its valuable finding, i.e., her symptoms improved after simple plasmapheresis and oral administration of D-penicillamine."
4140,457,Immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is a form of systemic amyloidosis in which the fibrils are derived from monoclonal light chains.
4141,457,"We report a case of a 66-year-old woman presenting with nail changes, parchment-like hand changes, progressive alopecia and sicca syndrome."
4142,457,"Histopathological studies of biopsy specimens of the scalp, the nail, minor labial salivary glands and abdominal skin revealed deposits of AL -type amyloid."
4143,457,Urine protein electrophoresis exhibited a weak band of -type light chains.
4144,457,"Based on this striking case, we here review the characteristic nail and hair manifestations associated with systemic amyloidosis."
4145,457,"Knowledge of these signs is important for an early diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis, identification of the underlying disease and patient management."
4146,458,Hematopoietic neoplasms represent about 1% of all laryngeal neoplasms.
4147,458,MALT lymphoma arises from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and is associated with chronic inflammatory disease.
4148,458,Patients with Sjgren syndrome have a higher risk for development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (MALT lymphoma).
4149,458,"To date, only cases of MALT lymphoma of the salivary glands, thymus and stomach associated with Sjgren syndrome have been published."
4150,458,We present the case of a MALT lymphoma of the larynx associated with Sjgren syndrome.
4151,458,Radiation and chemotherapy are the first line of therapy as published in the literature.
4152,459,"INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary amyloidoma or nodular amyloidosis is a localized form of amyloidosis, which can mimic a bronchopulmonary carcinoma."
4153,459,"This form of amyloidosis may be associated to an infectious, a systemic disease or a lymphoma."
4154,459,OBSERVATION: We describe the case of a 36-year-old patient whose past medical history was consistent for a diabetes mellitus and a hypothyroidism treated by medical treatment.
4155,459,The patient presented a Gougerot-Sjgren syndrome and was explored for non-specific respiratory symptoms.
4156,459,Physical examination was normal.
4157,459,Laboratory tests revealed a monoclonal pic of immunoglobulin.
4158,459,Radiologic findings showed bilateral pulmonary nodules associated to mediastinal lymph nodes.
4159,459,A pulmonary biopsy was performed.
4160,459,"Histologic examination revealed a tumoral nodule containing an abundant eosinophilic material, which was acellular and surrounded by a dense lymphomatous infiltrate destroying the pulmonary parenchyma."
4161,459,Histochemical and immunohistochemical study revealed an association of a nodular pulmonary amyloidosis with a MAT pulmonary lymphoma complicating a Gougerot-Sjgren syndrome.
4162,459,CONCLUSION: The association of MALT pulmonary lymphoma and localized amyloidosis is rarely observed in case of Gougerot-Sjgren syndrome.
4163,459,The pathogenesis of this association remains unknown and the management non-consensual because of the rarity of the cases reported.
4164,459,"Whereas, it appears that localized amyloidosis associated to a MALT lymphoma seems to have a better prognosis than a disseminated amyloidosis."
4165,460,"Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is a rare, systemic, reactive histiocytic disease of unknown aetiology."
4166,460,"Autoimmune diseases have previously been reported in association with multicentric reticulohistiocytosis, but whether this is a true association or mere coincidence is not known."
4167,460,"Here, we report the case of a 50-year-old woman who had been diagnosed as suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA), four years ago with positive rheumatoid serology was evaluated for multiple asymptotic papulonodules eruption."
4168,460,Histopathologic examination was suggestive of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis.
4169,460,She developed concomitantly Sjogren syndrome with systemic manifestations.
4170,460,"Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis may be misdiagnosed as RA, but evaluation of the time course of specific symptoms can greatly help in the correct diagnosis."
4171,460,The possibility of commune etiopathogeny of these affections is discussed.
4172,461,"A 33 year-old woman presented with intentional incontinence, motor aphasia, supranuclear gaze palsy, and spasticity after parotitis."
4173,461,"Brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) showed abnormal signaling in long corticospinal tract involving internal capsules and cerebral peduncles, middle cerebellar peduncle, and frontal subcortical white matter lesions."
4174,461,She had a long history of dry eye and mouth.
4175,461,"Immunoserological study showed that she was positive for anti-SS-A, aquaporin 4 (AQP4), and AQP5 antibodies."
4176,461,She clinically showed not only Sjgren's syndrome but also neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) without optic neuritis or myelitis.
4177,461,She responded to steroid followed by plasma exchange dramatically.
4178,461,"Thereafter, the relapse of brain lesion was once detected while tapering of steroid, but her symptoms have been stable for several years after administration of immunosuppressant."
4179,461,This case suggested that salivary gland inflammation might be associated with the pathogenesis of NMOSD.
4180,462,BACKGROUND: The frequency and type of central nervous system involvement in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) remain controversial.
4181,462,Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in pSS are usually discrete hyperintense areas in the white matter.
4182,462,Tumefactive brain lesions have been rarely reported.
4183,462,"CASE REPORT: We describe a 31-year-old woman who exhibited transcortical motor aphasia, hemiparesis and partial motor seizures as the initial manifestation of pSS."
4184,462,Brain MRI revealed a large frontoparietal lesion extending into the corpus callosum.
4185,462,The patient had spontaneous recovery and developed sicca symptoms 6 months after onset.
4186,462,"Primary SS was diagnosed on the basis of clinical features, abnormal Schirmer test findings, high levels of anti-La/SSB antibodies and positive salivary gland biopsy results."
4187,462,CONCLUSION: The present case suggests that a pseudotumoral brain lesion can occur as an initial symptom of pSS.
4188,463,RATIONALE: Purpura is a common dermatologic manifestation in Sjgren syndrome (SS).
4189,463,"When a patient presents with sicca symptoms, the diagnosis of SS is not difficult."
4190,463,"PATIENT CONCERNS: Here, we reported a case of a 52-year-old Chinese woman who initially presented with nonpalpable purpura on both lower extremities, and these lesions had developed soon after prolonged sitting."
4191,463,"In the past 2 years, she had repeated cutaneous nonpalpable purpura 4 times."
4192,463,"She had no sicca symptoms, dry eyes, or dry mouth."
4193,463,"DIAGNOSES: Combining the laboratory findings, Schirmer test, and labial gland biopsy, primary SS was confirmed."
4194,463,INTERVENTIONS: The patient was placed on a trial of hydroxychloroquine (200mg once daily).
4195,463,OUTCOMES: The purpura on both lower extremities had faded at the sixth day after onset and at the third day after hydroxychloroquine treatment.
4196,463,LESSONS: These case was not easy to diagnosis primary SS because she had no sicca symptoms.
4197,463,A patient with primary SS who initially presented with recurrent purpura associated with prolonged sitting.
4198,463,Prolonged sitting had been a possible aggravating factor for the cutaneous purpura of this patient with primary SS.
4199,464,BACKGROUND: The clinical features of lipid infiltration in the parotid glands (LIPG) have not been studied.
4200,464,Monitoring of atomic-bomb survivors for late effects of radiation exposure has provided the opportunity to review the clinical findings of LIPG.
4201,464,"METHODS: A total of 992 atomic-bomb survivors in Nagasaki, Japan underwent lachrymal and salivary secretion tests and anthropometric, biochemical, and abdominal ultrasonographic examinations between 2002 and 2004."
4202,464,"Among 465 subjects who had reduced tear and/or salivary excretion, 176 subjects took a salivary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination."
4203,464,RESULTS: LIPG was detected in 53 of the 176 subjects who had salivary MRI.
4204,464,LIPG cases showed a preponderance of females and fatty liver compared with the subjects without LIPG.
4205,464,"Age-and-sex-adjusted regression analysis revealed that body mass index (BMI), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c, and C-reactive protein were higher, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and adiponectin were lower, in the subjects with LIPG."
4206,464,Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that BMI and fatty liver were mutually associated with LIPG independently from radiation dose.
4207,464,"CONCLUSIONS: LIPG associated with BMI, fatty liver, and coronary risk factors was a clinical manifestation of metabolic syndrome."
4208,465,PURPOSE: To evaluate the applicability of in vivo laser scanning confocal microscopy as a tool of conjunctival cytology in a prospective case-control study.
4209,465,"METHODS: Nineteen right eyes of 19 Sjogren's syndrome dry eye patients (19 females; mean age: 55.815 years), and 18 right eyes of 18 normal healthy control subjects (12 females and 6 males; mean age: 50.814 years) were evaluated in this study."
4210,465,The eyes were analyzed by the Heidelberg retina tomography (HRTII)/Rostock cornea module (RCM).
4211,465,"Ocular surface and tear function tests including vital stainings (fluorescein and Rose Bengal), Schirmer test, tear film break up time (BUT), and conjunctival impression cytology were performed."
4212,465,"After obtaining the confocal microscopy images, the mean individual epithelial cell area (MIECA), and nucleocytoplasmic (N/C) ratio were analyzed."
4213,465,The correlation between confocal microscopy and impression cytology parameters was also investigated.
4214,465,"RESULTS: The BUT, Schirmer test values, vital staining scores and squamous metaplasia grades in impression cytology were significantly worse in dry eye patients compared to controls (p<0.0001)."
4215,465,The MIECA and the mean N/C ratios were worse in dry eye subjects compared to controls both in impression cytology and in vivo confocal microscopy (p<0.0001) with no significant differences between these parameters when the two examination techniques were compared.
4216,465,"The MIECA and N/C ratio in conjunctival impression cytology showed significant correlation with the corresponding confocal microscopy parameters (MIECA, r2:0.557 ; N/C, r2:0.765)."
4217,465,CONCLUSIONS: Laser scanning confocal microscopy seems to be an efficient non-invasive tool in the evaluation of phenotypic alterations of the conjunctival epithelium in dry eye disease.
4218,465,N/C ratio and MIECA appear to be two promising and new parameters of in vivo confocal cytology in the assessment of the ocular surface in dry eye disease.
4219,466,A 77-year-old man showed bilateral abducens palsies and multiple cranial nerve enhancement on magnetic resonance images (MRI) and aseptic meningitis.
4220,466,He had xerophthalmia and xerostomia.
4221,466,Serum anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibodies were present.
4222,466,He had Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) and corticosteroid therapy ameliorated the symptoms.
4223,466,The cranial nerve enhancement and the cerebrospinal fluid findings were normalized.
4224,466,"In patients with SjS, there have not been any reports of multiple areas of cranial nerve enhancement on MRI."
4225,466,We propose that in this case the aseptic meningitis and subsequent lymphocytic infiltration to the cranial nerves contributed to the multiple cranial neuropathy and multiple cranial nerve enhancement on MRI.
4226,467,"A 56-year-old HTLV-I-positive woman, initially diagnosed as having Sjgren's syndrome, presented with muscle weakness, myalgia, face erythema and leg edema."
4227,467,"Based on the presence of various autoantibodies, the diagnosis of overlap syndrome (dermatomyositis/Sjgren's syndrome) was made."
4228,467,Treatment with high-dose corticosteroid plus cyclosporine improved her symptoms.
4229,467,"However, three months after the start of these treatments, exacerbation of myositis occurred."
4230,467,"A muscle biopsy revealed prominent perivascular accumulation of mononuclear cells with perifascicular atrophy, which were consistent with dermatomyositis."
4231,467,"Tacrolimus, which was substituted for cyclosporine led to marked improvement of the myositis symptoms."
4232,468,PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of non-invasive tear stability assessment with forced eye opening on the lower tear meniscus.
4233,468,METHODS: Twenty-three eyes of 23 patients with aqueous-deficient dry eye and 23 eyes of 23 normal subjects were enrolled.
4234,468,All subjects underwent imaging with a Keratograph 5M equipped with a modified tear film scanning function.
4235,468,"Lower tear meniscus images were captured, and tear meniscus height (TMH) was measured with an integrated ruler before and after non-invasive Keratograph break-up time (NIKBUT) measurements in each subject."
4236,468,"Subjects were instructed to keep their eyes open as long as possible during NIKBUT measurements, and the recording was discontinued at the next blink."
4237,468,"RESULTS: The TMH values of the normal and dry eye groups were 0.200.05 mm and 0.140.03 mm, respectively, at baseline."
4238,468,The TMH values of dry eyes were significantly smaller than those of normal eyes (p<0.001).
4239,468,"Significant increases in TMH values were observed in both normal (0.100.12 mm) and dry eyes (0.040.09 mm) with the NIKBUT measurement (p<0.001, p=0.039)."
4240,468,"A moderate negative correlation was observed between increased TMH and baseline TMH in dry eyes (r=-0.44, p=0.03), whereas no correlation was observed in normal eyes (r=0.04, p=0.85)."
4241,468,"CONCLUSIONS: Forced eye opening required for the non-invasive tear stability assessment influences the TMH measurement possibly due to reflex tear secretion, even in patients with aqueous-deficient dry eye."
4242,468,TMH should be assessed before tests that require forced eye opening.
4243,469,PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of aminoacid enriched artificial tears on the ocular surface of patients with dysfunctional tear syndrome (DTS).
4244,469,METHODS: Forty patients were divided into two groups: group 1 treated for 90 days with sodium hyaluronate (SH) 0.15% 1 drop  5 times/day; group 2 treated for 90 days with SH 0.15% + aminoacids mixture 1 drop  5 times/day.
4245,469,"Symptom score questionnaire, tear break-up time (TBUT), corneal fluorescein stain, Shirmer's I test and confocal microscopy were performed at baseline and after 30 and 90 days."
4246,469,Confocal images underwent morphometric analysis.
4247,469,RESULTS: Both treatments improved symptoms after 1 month.
4248,469,"Group 2 patients showed at 1 month an improvement of TBUT and corneal stain, maintained throughout the study."
4249,469,Also Shirmer's I test improved after 3 months.
4250,469,"In group 1, an improvement of TBUT and corneal stain was observed after 3 months."
4251,469,The morphometric analysis of confocal images demonstrated at month 1 an improvement of nerve tortuosity in group 2; after 3 months both groups showed a significant improvement versus baseline.
4252,469,"The epithelium showed, in both groups, a reduction in hyperreflective large cells starting from 1 month; the area of the cells was significantly reduced after 3 months, with a significant higher reduction in group 2."
4253,469,"The perineural stromal opacity was significantly increased after 3 months, particularly in group 2."
4254,469,CONCLUSION: This is the first study addressing corneal changes after amino acids administration in a DTS population.
4255,469,The treatment with amino acids enriched SH can be considered a useful tool in the treatment of DTS.
4256,470,Sjgren's syndrome is a frequent auto-immune disorder with a pulmonary location in almost 10% of the patients.
4257,470,"Although bronchial involvement is very common, most patients only complain of cough and this involvement rarely results in severe symptoms or chronic respiratory failure are rarely observed."
4258,470,We describe here 5 patients with severe chronic bronchiolitis revealing primary Sjgren's syndrome.
4259,470,"The lung involvement resulted in chronic bronchorrhea, recurrent sinusitis, diffuse bronchiolar nodules with bronchiectasis on the CT scan, and a severe obstructive airway pattern on lung function tests."
4260,470,"Improvement was obtained in 4 patients with combination of inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled long acting beta-agonists, and a low dose of erythromycin."
4261,471,"We report a case of 36-year-old woman, admitted for hypotonic tetraparesis."
4262,471,"Laboratory tests revealed severe hypokalaemia, acidosis, hyperchloremia and alkaline urinary pH allowing the diagnosis of distal tubular acidosis."
4263,471,Additional investigations led to the diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome associated with Hashimoto's thyroditis.
4264,471,"The evolution was favorable under potassium citrate alkalinisation, the corticosteroid therapy and hormonal substitution."
4265,471,"Based on this observation, the pathogenesis of distal tubular acidosis during auto-immune diseases (Sjgren's syndrome, monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, hypothyroidism) was discussed as well as its consequences and management."
4266,472,It is well known that patients with peripheral neuropathy along with autonomic involvement can also exhibit autonomic hyperactivity.
4267,472,There are rare cases in which these patients developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).
4268,472,"Patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) may be more likely to exhibit autonomic hypofunction rather than autonomic hyperfunction, which is a rare event."
4269,472,"In the present work, we report the first known case of PRES as an initial neurological manifestation of pSS."
4270,473,A 67-year-old woman suffered from a burning mouth feeling for 1.5 years and was referred by her dentist to a saliva clinic.
4271,473,"At the clinic persistent xerostomia was diagnosed, and Sjgren's syndrome was suspected."
4272,473,"After 1 year, a new measurement of the saliva secretion was carried out, which revealed a further decline in saliva secretion rate."
4273,473,The patient was consequently treated with an intra-oral electrostimulating device in order to stimulate the saliva secretion rate and reduce the feeling of a dry mouth.
4274,473,"After 2 weeks, the patient experienced a considerable improvement of the subjective oral dryness."
4275,474,PURPOSE: To report an atypical case of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) with Sjgren syndrome that presented only ileus as a neurologic finding.
4276,474,"CASE: A thirty two-year-old woman was hospitalized for abnormal abdominal symptoms, and was diagnosed as having paralytic ileus."
4277,474,"Dry eye symptoms due to Sjogren syndrome were also observed, and visual acuity OU decreased suddenly 10 days after hospitalization."
4278,474,"The best corrected visual acuity was 0.04 OD and 0.6 OS, and the optic discs OU were swollen and red."
4279,474,"Although no neurologic signs were found, pleocytosis and abnormal MRI findings suggested NMO."
4280,474,"Steroid pulse therapy was performed, and after three cycles, the ileus symptoms disappeared, and the disturbed visual acuity OU returned to normal."
4281,474,"Because the anti-aquaporin 4 antibody was positive and no abnormal abdominal findings that might have caused ileus were found, we diagnosed NMO presenting only paralytic ileus as a neurologic finding."
4282,474,CONCLUSIONS: Differential diagnosis is important for NMO initiated by ileus as the only neurologic sign.
4283,475,"The patient described here is a 21-year-old Japanese woman with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) presenting with worsening of dyspnea, palpitation, recurrent parotitis, and arthritis."
4284,475,Chest computed tomography showed diffuse interlobular septal thickening and ground-glass opacities.
4285,475,"Right heart catheterization demonstrated pulmonary hypertension, right-sided heart failure, normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and no evidence of arterio-venous shunt."
4286,475,"Transbronchial lung biopsy showed luminal obliteration of pulmonary venules by intimal cellular proliferations, without abnormalities in the small pulmonary arteries."
4287,475,These findings were consistent with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD).
4288,475,"Immunosuppressive therapy, starting with prednisolone 20 mg/day and subsequently combined with azathioprine, resulted in the disappearance of the signs and symptoms, including exertional dyspnea and abnormal pulmonary parenchymal shadows on computed tomography, and the normalization of pulmonary artery pressure."
4289,475,"So far, there have been no reported cases of PVOD associated with pSS."
4290,475,"Of interest, immunosuppressive therapy without vasodilator therapy almost completely resolved the pulmonary hypertension in this patient."
4291,476,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) improves the diagnostic performance of the 2012 ACR classification criteria for SS.
4292,476,"METHODS: We studied a cohort of 101 patients with suspected SS seen at a single centre in Brittany, France."
4293,476,An SGUS echostructure score 2 was considered abnormal.
4294,476,The reference standard was a clinical diagnosis of SS made by a group of experts blinded to SGUS findings.
4295,476,RESULTS: SS was diagnosed in 45 patients.
4296,476,Similar proportions of patients with and without SS had an ocular staining score 3.
4297,476,Adding RF positivity and ANA titre 1:320 as an alternative to anti-SSA/SSB positivity increased the sensitivity of the serological item without modifying specificity compared with using anti-SSA/SSB alone.
4298,476,SGUS was 60.0% sensitive and 87.5% specific for SS.
4299,476,"Adding the SGUS score to the ACR criteria increased sensitivity from 64.4% to 84.4% and only slightly decreased specificity, from 91.1% to 89.3%."
4300,476,CONCLUSION: The diagnostic performance of the ACR classification criteria for SS is notably improved by adding the SGUS score.
4301,476,SGUS should be included in future classification criteria for SS.
4302,477,"The authors present a clinical case of a male, 53-years old with a multiple sclerosis like syndrome, progressive, with 3 years of evolution."
4303,477,"The patient also referred dry eye and inflammatory arthralgias, the complementary workup was according with Sjgren's Syndrome."
4304,477,The central nervous system involvement of Sjgren's Syndrome and the difficulty of differential diagnosis with neurological diseases such as Multiple sclerosis is discussed.
4305,478,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by progressive lymphocyte infiltration of the exocrine glands.
4306,478,"Overt or latent renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a common extraglandular manifestation of pSS.Vitamin D deficiency is associated with autoimmune disorders; however, the potential correlation between pSS and vitamin D deficiency is rarely discussed."
4307,478,"The current patient presented with distal RTA, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia that were found to be secondary to both vitamin D deficiency and pSS."
4308,478,"In patients diagnosed with both distal RTA and vitamin D deficiency, clinicians should consider autoimmune diseases such as pSS, as a possible underlying etiology."
4309,479,"OBJECTIVE: To address the clinical features of malignant lymphoma (ML) occurring in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), understand their similarities and differences and explore their risk factors."
4310,479,METHODS: Medical records of 17 cases of pSS/ML inpatients admitted to our hospital from January 1980 to August 2010 were systemically reviewed.
4311,479,And 163 cases were randomly selected as controls from 4485 pSS/nML inpatients at our hospital during the same period.
4312,479,RESULTS: There were 14 females and 3 m ales with the diagnostic age of pSS at (53  13) years old.
4313,479,And the disease duration was (8  9) years.
4314,479,There was no significant difference between two groups in three general aspects (P > 0.05).
4315,479,The gap between pSS and ML was (4  4) years.
4316,479,"Several significant differences existed between two groups (P < 0.05) in clinical features and laboratory findings: lymphadenopathy, parothydomegalia and leucopenia."
4317,479,"The pathologic categories of ML in pSS/ML included NHL (n = 15) (14 cases of B-cell origin), HL (n = 1) and lymphosarcoma (n = 1)."
4318,479,"CONCLUSION: During the course of pSS, the occurrence of such manifestations as lymphadenopathy, parothydomegalia and leucopenia, etc.tends to have a complication of ML with a dominance of NHL."
4319,479,And a worse prognosis is expected.
4320,480,Sjgren's syndrome is primarily a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that affects exocrine organs.
4321,480,Neurologic symptoms frequently present as peripheral neuropathy due to small vessel vasculitis.
4322,480,Type and prevalence of central nervous system involvement are still controversial.
4323,480,"In this report, we present a 35-year-old woman with primary Sjgren's syndrome with central nervous system vasculitic involvement."
4324,481,We reported 1 case of primary Sjgren syndrome in a child.
4325,481,"The patient complained recurrent submandibular inflammation for more than 2 years without apparent sicca presentations, and Schirmer test resulted negative."
4326,481,"However, ultrasound showed hypoechoic areas in the gland, laboratory tests reported the positivity of Sjgren's syndrome A antigen and Sjgren's syndrome B antigen, and biopsy presented periductal lymphocytic infiltration."
4327,481,"Therefore, a diagnosis of primary Sjgren syndrome was conducted."
4328,481,Treatment of it required a multidisciplinary team.
4329,482,A 36-year-old woman presented with hemolytic anemia without a reticulocyte response 38 days after delivery.
4330,482,A marked reduction in erythroid cells and an increase in macrophages with active hemophagocytosis were noted in the bone marrow.
4331,482,"While conventional Coombs' tests were negative, the level of red blood cell (RBC)-bound immunoglobulin G (IgG) was increased."
4332,482,"The patient was diagnosed with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) based on her symptoms, positive anti-SS-A antibodies, Coombs-negative autoimmune hemolytic anemia and pure red cell aplasia associated with RBC-bound IgG and hemophagocytosis."
4333,482,"The unique presentation was considered to be a consequence of immunological derangement associated with pSS, pregnancy and delivery."
4334,483,"Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by xerophthalmia, xerostomia and extraglandular manifestations."
4335,483,"Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and lymphoproliferative disorders, including lymphoma are well-known extraglandular, hematological complications of SS."
4336,483,We report here a rare case of patient with primary SS who developed pancytopenia with severe thrombocytopenia as an initial manifestation and successfully treated with IV immunoglobulin (IVIG).
4337,483,"The present case suggests that pancytopenia with severe thrombocytopenia can be a difficult-to-treat abnormality, and initial manifestation of primary SS and IVIG might be an effective treatment for severe thrombocytopenia refractory to high-dose steroid in primary SS."
4338,484,"Tuberculous myositis, which mimics rheumatic symptoms, is an extremely rare disease."
4339,484,Clinical ambiguity easily leads to misdiagnosis and delayed initial treatment.
4340,484,We present the case of a 55-year-old man who had primary Sjgren's syndrome and active cutaneous vasculitis treated with steroid and immunosuppressive drugs.
4341,484,"He presented with a swollen, painful, hot left thigh."
4342,484,"Although anti-tuberculosis medications were administered soon after a positive acid-fast stain of incisional muscular tissue, he died of rapidly progressive tuberculous myositis and multiorgan failure following 18 days of hospitalization."
4343,484,This case is presented to increase the awareness of this rare entity in clinical practice.
4344,485,"Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare but potentially lethal condition requiring rapid recognition, diagnosis, and initiation of therapy."
4345,485,We experienced a case of a 61-year-old woman with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) complicated with severe renal TMA/TTP following IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).
4346,485,"She was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation of hypergammaglobulinema, acute renal failure, and severe thrombocytopenia."
4347,485,She had been diagnosed with pSS 13 years prior to admission.
4348,485,"Histological examination of her kidney revealed fibrin thrombi in the glomeruli and arterioles, a finding that is consistent with TMA/TTP."
4349,485,"The patient was subsequently treated with plasma exchange, which resulted in a successful outcome without any complications."
4350,485,This rare case suggests that it is important to make a therapeutic decision based on appropriate and prompt pathological diagnosis.
4351,486,"Chronic interstitial cystitis (IC), mostly affecting middle-aged women, is a very rare manifestation of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
4352,486,"Hereby, we report a 42-year-old woman with pSS, presenting with dysuria, urinary frequency, and suprapubic pain."
4353,486,"She was diagnosed to have chronic IC, based upon the cystoscopic biopsy finding of chronic inflammation in the bladder wall."
4354,486,Systemic corticosteroid and azathioprine treatments together with local intravesical therapies were not effective.
4355,486,"Therefore, cyclosporine (CSA) therapy was initiated."
4356,486,"Initial low dose of CSA (1.5 mg/kg/d) improved the symptoms of the patient, with no requirement for dose increment."
4357,486,"After 4 months of therapy, control cystoscopic biopsy showed that bladder inflammation regressed and IC improved."
4358,486,This case suggests that even low doses of CSA may be beneficial for treating chronic IC associated with pSS syndrome.
4359,487,We report the case of a 48-year-old woman who presented with bilateral parotid gland enlargement as the initial manifestation of primary Sjgren syndrome.
4360,487,"Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple areas of low-intensity signal mixed with foci of high-intensity signal, a finding suggestive of Sjgren syndrome."
4361,487,"Autoimmune blood tests for Sjgren syndrome were positive, and a sublabial biopsy confirmed the diagnosis."
4362,487,"Investigations for other conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus infection, were negative."
4363,487,"After 5 years of follow-up, the parotid swellings remained essentially unchanged."
4364,487,"We discuss the etiology of multicystic parotid gland pathology, its involvement in Sjgren syndrome, and the risk of lymphoma."
4365,488,"Primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS) is a chronic, slowly progressive inflammatory autoimmune disorder, characterised by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands, leading to decrease of glandular secretion."
4366,488,"In 40-60% of pSS patients, extraglandular disease develops."
4367,488,We present the case of a patient with two extraglandular sites involvement in the course of pSS manifesting with progressive respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.
4368,489,An 84-year-old female patient with known Sjgren syndrome underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT to detect recurrence of uterine cervix cancer.
4369,489,Sjgren syndrome is autoimmune disease that typically produces symptoms of dry mouth and eyes.
4370,489,"We report a case of physiologic 18F-FDG uptake on facial muscles by chewing-like habitual movement, which was confused with salivary retention at first."
4371,489,The physiologic FDG uptake in oral cavity and facial muscles has to be reviewed carefully not to be confused with abnormal uptake.
4372,490,Thymic mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is rare.
4373,490,Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) has strong association with thymic MALT lymphoma but the exact etiology is unknown.
4374,490,"On the other hand, SjS is characterized by the complication of various lung manifestations, including lung cysts."
4375,490,The mechanism for these lesions is also unknown.
4376,490,But the underlying SjS could result in MALT lymphoma with lung cysts.
4377,490,"Herein, we demonstrate two surgical cases of thymic MALT lymphoma associated with multiple lung cysts and the characterization of this rare tumor."
4378,490,"During surgery, the tumors were found to be well capsuled and had no adhesion or invasion to the surrounding tissues consistent with its characteristics of low grade malignancy."
4379,490,"When thymic MALT lymphoma is suspected clinically, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery might be the best approach for diagnosis."
4380,490,We propose that radiological findings of a thymic tumor along with lung cysts are an indication of thymic MALT lymphoma.
4381,491,The risk of malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma is increased in primary Sjgren syndrome.
4382,491,"In the literature, most studies evaluating this risk were conducted in tertiary reference university hospital."
4383,491,"So, selection bias in series exists, in particular selection of the most severe cases in tertiary reference university care centers."
4384,491,Some studies had also a selection bias because patients were hospitalized (data were obtained from hospital discharge registries) and therefore the more severe cases were considered.
4385,491,"Between October 1999 and November 2009, 109 adult patients were admitted to our department of internal medicine (non-university hospital, secondary level of the healthcare system, hospitalized patients and outpatient) with diagnosis of primary Sjgren syndrome."
4386,491,Two cases of parotid gland lymphoma occurred during the period of follow-up.
4387,491,No other lymphoma was detected.
4388,491,"In this study, clinically identifiable parotid gland non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurs in 1.8% of patients with primary Sjgren syndrome."
4389,491,"Because most non-Hodgkin lymphoma initially involves the neck organs, meticulous imaging studies mainly focused on the cervical regions are recommended in the follow-up of patients with primary Sjgren syndrome."
4390,491,Patients whose main complaint is persistent parotid gland swelling may have a parotid biopsy in order to diagnose non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
4391,492,Rumpel-Leede phenomenon is a rare clinical sign involving the appearance of purpura after application of a tourniquet or in noninvasive arterial blood pressure monitoring.
4392,492,This sign has been most commonly associated with hypertensive and diabetic microvascular fragility and thrombocytopenia.
4393,492,"We describe a case of Rumpel-Leede phenomenon in an otherwise healthy patient with positive laboratory markers for Sjgren disease, a previously undescribed relationship."
4394,492,We aim to inform physicians of this potential complication in patients with Sjgren disease and suggest special consideration be given to patients with autoimmune diseases with secondary vascular or dermal manifestations.
4395,493,Sjgren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune exocrinopathy that destroys salivary and lacrimal gland tissue.
4396,493,We report an unusual case of this disease in a 40-year-old woman who presented with bilateral parotid cystic masses.
4397,493,"As this case illustrates, Sjgren syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of bilateral cystic parotid lesions."
4398,494,Hypokalemic paralysis represents a medical emergency requiring both rapid diagnosis and treatment.
4399,494,In this Attending Rounds a patient with hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis is presented to emphasize the role of routine laboratory studies in the assessment of such patients so that a correct diagnosis can be made and appropriate treatment can be initiated promptly.
4400,495,Primary Sjgren syndrome (PSS) rarely occurs in children.
4401,495,"In addition, because the objective and subjective diagnostic criteria for juvenile PSS differ from those seen in adults, identification of its presence can be difficult to establish."
4402,495,This case report illustrates the accepted benchmarks for diagnosing pediatric PSS.
4403,496,The clinical picture of enlarged submandibular gland and/or enlarged lacrimal gland often leads to difficulties in differential diagnostics.
4404,496,From the perspective of rheumatology Sjgren's syndrome should be excluded especially in patients who complained of xerophthalmia and xerostomia for longer than 3 months.
4405,496,In this article the authors report the case of a patient who presented to clarify swelling of the submandibular gland and xerostomia.
4406,496,"In close cooperation with rheumatologists, otolaryngologists and pathologists the diagnosis of IgG4-associated sialoadenitis (IgG4-associated Mikulicz's disease) could be reached."
4407,497,"Primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by infiltration of lymphocytes in exocrine glands, followed by hypofunction of the glands."
4408,497,"Dry mouth and eyes are main symptoms, but there are various extraglandular manifestations in pSS."
4409,497,Nine to 75% of patients have pulmonary involvement such as interstitial lung diseases.
4410,497,"Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is also a kind of autoimmune disorder, characterized by the presence of anti-granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor antibody."
4411,497,A 45-year-old nonsmoking woman was admitted with dyspnea and dry cough.
4412,497,"She was diagnosed as having PAP, based on characteristic computed tomography, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung biopsy findings."
4413,497,"At the same time, she was diagnosed with pSS, based on dry mouth, xerophthalmia, positive anti-Ro/La antibodies, and scintigraphic finding of salivary glands."
4414,497,Whole lung lavages and monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide had slight improvement in PAP.
4415,498,We report a case of a 41-year-old woman admitted to our hospital for dyspnea on exertion and nonproductive cough.
4416,498,"High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) revealed central ground-glass opacities surrounded by ring-shaped areas of consolidation (reversed halo sign), predominantly in the lower lobes."
4417,498,"Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed an increase of the total number of cells (35 x 10(4)/ml), including elevated lymphocyte level (69%) and decreased CD4/CD8 ratio (0.45)."
4418,498,"Histopathological examination by transbronchial lung biopsy showed polypoid masses of granulation tissue filling the lumens of a respiratory bronchiole and alveolar ducts, consistent with organizing pneumonia."
4419,498,After admission the patient complained of dry eyes and dry mouth.
4420,498,The serum anti-SS-A antibody level was also elevated (65.0 U/ml).
4421,498,Labial salivary gland biopsy specimens revealed focal lymphocytic infiltration of more than 50 per 4 mm(2).
4422,498,There were no findings of rheumatoid arthritis or other collagen diseases.
4423,498,We diagnosed primary Sjgren syndrome with secondary organizing pneumonia with a reversed halo sign.
4424,498,"She was treated with prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg body weight, 35 mg/day)."
4425,498,"After treatment, the chest CT showed improvement through consolidation."
4426,499,Primitive Gougerot-Sjgren syndrome (PGSS) is a systemic autoimmune exocrinopathy in which twenty percent of affected patients develop neurological manifestations.
4427,499,It has been little described in the Black African literature.
4428,499,We report a case of PGSS in a 64-year-old Black woman as revealed by neurological manifestations in an inflammatory context.
4429,499,Central neuropathy was present and the patient fulfilled at least four of the six Vitali American-European diagnostic criteria.
4430,499,There were abnormal aspects on the sylvian artery and hyperintense lesions of periventricular predominance.
4431,499,PGSS is a serious disease which we must consider when we encounter any unexplained neurological manifestations especially those associated with vasculitic lesions.
4432,500,Gougerot Sjgren syndrome is rare during childhood.
4433,500,"Diagnosis in adult patients is usually based on sets of criteria combining clinical, serological, and salivary gland histopathological findings."
4434,500,"In the pediatric age group, clinical manifestations might be different from the adult form."
4435,500,We report on 3 cases of childhood Gougerot Sjgren syndrome.
4436,501,We report a case of miliary sarcoidosis with secondary Sjogren's in a 45-year-old male who presented with symptoms of sicca syndrome in the form of dryness of eyes and mouth with parotid swelling.
4437,501,"Computed tomography thorax showed mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, bilateral miliary opacities in lung parenchyma."
4438,501,"Whole body FDG PET/CT showed involvement of both parotids, liver, diffuse uptake in lungs, mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes."
4439,501,Patient is on treatment with prednisolone and has responded well.
4440,502,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune exocrinopathy associated with severe secretory alterations by disruption of the glandular architecture integrity, which is fundamental for a correct function and localization of the secretory machinery."
4441,502,"Syt-1, PI(4,5)P(2) and Ca(2+) are significant factors controlling exocytosis in different secretory cells, the Ca(2+) role being the most studied."
4442,502,"Salivary acinar cells from SS-patients show a defective agonist-regulated intracellular Ca(2+) release together with a decreased IP3R expression level, and this condition may explain a reduced water release."
4443,502,"However, there are not reports where Syt-1, PI(4,5)P(2) and Ca(2+) in acinar cells of SS patients had been studied."
4444,502,"In the present study, we analyzed the expression and/or localization of Syt-1 and PI(4,5)P(2) in acinar cells of labial salivary gland biopsies from SS-patients and control individuals."
4445,502,"Also, we evaluated whether the overexpression of Syt-1 and the loss of cell polarity induced by TNF- or loss of interaction between acinar cell and basal lamina, alters directionality of the exocytosis process, Ca(2+) signaling and -amylase secretion in a 3D-acini model stimulated with cholinergic or -adrenergic agonists."
4446,502,"In addition, the correlation between Syt-1 protein levels and clinical parameters was evaluated."
4447,502,"The results showed an increase of Syt-1mRNA and protein levels, and a high number of co-localization points of Syt-1/STX4 and PI(4,5)P(2)/Ezrin in the acinar basolateral region of LSG from SS-patients."
4448,502,"With regard to 3D-acini, Syt-1 overexpression increased exocytosis in the apical pole compared to control acini."
4449,502,"TNF- stimulation increased exocytic events in the basal pole, which was further enhanced by Syt-1 overexpression."
4450,502,"Additionally, altered acinar cell polarity affected Ca(2+) signaling and amylase secretion."
4451,502,Overexpression of Syt-1 was associated with salivary gland alterations revealing that the secretory dysfunction in SS-patients is linked to altered expression and/or localization of secretory machinery components together with impaired epithelial cell polarity.
4452,502,"These findings provide a novel insight on the pathological mechanism implicated in ectopic secretory products to the extracellular matrix of LSG from SS-patients, which might initiate inflammation."
4453,503,Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoKPP) is a clinical entity characterized by recurrent skeletal muscle paralysis due to a decrease in serum potassium levels; hypoKPP can have either a primary (familial) or a secondary cause.
4454,503,One of the secondary causes of hypoKPP is distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA).
4455,503,"Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is diagnosed when the urinary pH is greater than 5.3 and in the presence of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia, with one of the causes being primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
4456,503,"PSS can have both glandular and extra glandular manifestations, with dryness of the eyes and mouth being the most common presenting symptoms."
4457,503,"DRTA arising from pSS is very unusual, occurring in fewer than 2% of the cases of Sjogren's syndrome (SS)."
4458,503,"Here, we report on a case of recurrent flaccid quadriparesis that appears to have been caused by distal RTA, resulting in hypokalemia; upon further investigation and clinical evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with pSS."
4459,504,"OBJECTIVE: To study evolution of pSS immunological profile, impact on pSS activity and the long-term evolution of patients with atypical auto-antibodies in a bicentric cohort of patients with pSS (n=445, mean age 53.6+/-14years, mean follow-up 76.1+/-51months)."
4460,504,RESULTS: 212 patients were SSA positive and 131 were both SSA and SSB positive.
4461,504,"During follow-up, SSA antibodies disappear in 8 patients; 2 of them exhibit new systemic complications of pSS."
4462,504,68 patients had cryoglobulinemia.
4463,504,"52 patients had other anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) specificities: anti-RNP (n=12), anti-centromere (n=14), anti-DNA native (n=19), anti-Scl70 (n=3), anti-JO1 (n=3), anti-Sm (n=3) and anti-histone (n=1)."
4464,504,"Fourteen patients developed ANA-associated auto-immune disease during the follow-up: 5 polymyositis (mean apparition delay 78months), 6 systemic lupus erythematosus (mean occurrence delay 77months) and 2 systemic sclerosis (mean occurrence delay 133+/-64months)."
4465,504,"Among these 14 patients, only three presented atypical-ANA at pSS diagnosis."
4466,504,Cryoglobulinemia and anti-SSA and SSB antibodies at diagnosis were associated with new systemic involvements.
4467,504,IN CONCLUSION: Cryoglobulinemia and SSA/SSB positivity are associated with systemic activity after diagnosis in pSS.
4468,504,"Although atypical ANA are found in 12% of the cases, long-term evolution to ANA associated auto-immune diseases concerned patients with active immunological profile and extra-glandular manifestations."
4469,505,"BACKGROUND: Sjgren's Syndrome is an autoimmune exocrinopathy characterised by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands in multiple sites, with dry mouth as a primary presenting symptom."
4470,505,"Although quantitative studies have shown the negative impact of both dry mouth and Sjgren's Syndrome on patients' quality of life, no qualitative diary and interview study has been undertaken to examine the lived experience of dry mouth for Sjgren's Syndrome sufferers."
4471,505,The aim of this qualitative study was to provide clinicians with insight into how dry mouth can impact on the daily lives of Sjgren's Syndrome patients.
4472,505,METHODS: The American-European Consensus Group (AECG) Revised International Classification criteria were used to identify participants from patients seen in an oral medicine clinic.
4473,505,"After pilot study work to test the approach, the 10 main study participants were recruited."
4474,505,Diary entries and semi-structured interviews were used to explore how dry mouth affects their lives.
4475,505,"Owing to the exploratory nature of the research, thematic content analysis was applied, allowing the themes to arise naturalistically from the data without bias or elicitation."
4476,505,"RESULTS: The data showed that it is unrealistic to understand the experience of a single symptom, but that the disease as a whole needs to be taken into perspective."
4477,505,The empirical evidence supported four main themes that depicted the lived experience of Sjgren's Syndrome.
4478,505,These included: (1) the journey to diagnosis; (2) disease impact spectrum (of dry mouth amid other symptoms); (3) interactions with healthcare professionals; and (4) the positive coping process.
4479,505,"CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed patients' perspectives on diagnosis, coping with dry mouth and Sjgren's Syndrome, and interaction with healthcare professionals."
4480,505,Dry mouth is not a trivial symptom for Sjgren's Syndrome sufferers; it has considerable impact on their day-to-day lives.
4481,505,Healthcare professionals need to understand patients as individuals in their environment in order to be part of the Sjgren's journey.
4482,506,Renal involvement in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is not uncommon.
4483,506,Autoimmune tubulointerstitial disorders and distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) account for majority of the cases of renal involvement.
4484,506,"While dRTA may precede the onset of sicca syndrome in pSS, nephrocalcinosis as a presenting manifestation of pSS is rare."
4485,506,"Here, to emphasize the need for initiating investigations for pSS in any patient presenting with nephrocalcinosis due to dRTA, we report a 21-year-old woman presenting with nephrocalcinosis long before pSS was objectively diagnosed."
4486,507,"BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic immune-mediated disease whose main characteristic is exocrine gland inflammation and, subsequent reduction in tear and saliva production."
4487,507,A delayed diagnosis is common due to the nonspecific clinical manifestations of disease.
4488,507,The aim of the present study was to develop recommendations for the diagnosis of glandular manifestations of pSS based on evidence and expert opinion.
4489,507,We conducted a systematic literature review to retrieve the best evidence available on the accuracy of diagnostic tests for pSS.
4490,507,"We also held two in-person meetings with experts (rheumatologists, pathologists, ophthalmologists and dentists) to establish their level of agreement using the Delphi method."
4491,507,"Ultimately, we generated 18 recommendations that aim to facilitate the diagnosis of the glandular manifestations of pSS."
4492,507,CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of glandular manifestations of pSS is complex and multidisciplinary.
4493,507,"It requires specific knowledge in the field of ophthalmology, immunology, pathology and imaging, making it compulsory for the rheumatologist to work with professionals from these different areas in order to improve accuracy and early diagnosis."
4494,507,"Glandular dysfunction tests, ANA, RF, Anti-Ro, protein electrophoresis, urinalysis, blood count, C-Reactive protein, complement, testing for syphilis and viruses (HCV, HIV) and SGUS should be investigated when dryness or systemic manifestation are present."
4495,507,Minor salivary gland biopsy is recommended for all anti-Ro negative or incomplete criteria cases.
4496,508,"OBJECTIVE: There are different imaging techniques to assess the parotid glands (i.e., sialography, salivary gland scintigraphy) in patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS)."
4497,508,"However, their use is limited by the invasive character or high cost."
4498,508,Ultrasound (US) is gaining interest by rheumatologists as a complementary diagnostic tool for SS.
4499,508,"To date, there is an increasing body of evidence supporting its sensitivity in the assessment of salivary glands in SS."
4500,508,The aim of our study was to analyze the potential role of US as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in SS and to discuss existing evidence to support its application use.
4501,508,"METHODS: A systematic search was performed in the electronic database PubMed, using the following search terms: (salivary glands OR parotid glands OR submandibular glands) AND Sjgren's syndrome AND (ultrasonography OR ultrasound OR sonography)."
4502,508,"Titles, abstracts, and full reports were systematically screened."
4503,508,"RESULTS: The results of the studies analyzed in this review show encouraging results in terms of accuracy, validity, and diagnostic value, which leads us to believe that in the future US could become the reference imaging tool to assess SS."
4504,508,"The studies include a small cohort of patients, and there is no standardized approach in terms of US techniques for the assessment of salivary glands."
4505,508,"CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound of major salivary glands is a useful tool for diagnosis, prognostic evaluation, and response to treatment in SS."
4506,508,"The use of this imaging technology is still under development, and more multicentric studies are needed to validate this tool."
4507,509,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of salivary gland ultrasonography for the diagnosis of primary and secondary Sjgren's syndromes (pSS and sSS).
4508,509,METHOD: Multicenter cross-sectional study on 97 patients with clinical sicca symptoms.
4509,509,The pSS (n=22) met the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) classification criteria.
4510,509,The control patients (n=36) with sicca symptoms did not fulfill the AECG criteria.
4511,509,"Four scores were used to evaluate the 4 major salivary gland echostructure: the Salaffi score (0-16), Jousse-Joulin score (0-4), Hocevar score (0-48) and Milic score (0-12)."
4512,509,RESULTS: The medians of ultrasonographic (US) scores were higher in the pSS and sSS groups than in the control group (P<0.001).
4513,509,The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of the four scores showed a good diagnostic performance for the US diagnosis of pSS and sSS.
4514,509,"Respectively, for pSS and sSS, the AUC were 0.891 (95%CI 0.812-0.970) and 0.824 (95%CI 0.695-0.954) for Hocevar score, 0.885 (95%CI 0.804-0.965) and 0.808 (95%CI 0.673-0.943) for Milic score, 0.915 (95%CI 0.848-0.982) and 0.844 (95%CI 0.724-0.965) for Salaffi score, 0.897 (95%CI 0.821-0.973) and 0.851 (95%CI 0.735-0.968) for Jousse-Joulin score."
4515,509,This study showed an interesting inter-observer reproducibility (kappa=0.7140.131) of the US evaluation with 85.7% agreement between reader to determine the pathological character of the salivary glands.
4516,509,"CONCLUSION: Salivary gland US is a simple, non-invasive and performant imaging procedure for the diagnosis of pSS and sSS, with Salaffi, Milic and Jousse-Joulin scores."
4517,510,Granulomatous mastitis is a rare and often considered as idiopathic disease.
4518,510,"However, clinical examination and thorough diagnostic investigations have to be carried out in order to identify cases that are secondary to infections or systemic diseases since these forms may be cured with appropriate etiologic treatment."
4519,510,"To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to describe the association of granulomatous mastitis with Sjgren's syndrome."
4520,510,"We discuss the clinical, pathological and therapeutic implications of this association."
4521,511,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between histologic findings in the minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) and anti La (La/SS-B)y antiRo antibodies (Ro/SS-A), antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and Rheumatoid Factor (RF),and compare the value of the latter as diagnostic tests with MSGB, considered as the gold standard."
4522,511,MATERIAL AND METHOD: Patients with suspected Primary Sjgren Syndrome (PSS) referred for MSGB were included.
4523,511,Antibody measurements were performed.
4524,511,Grade III and IV biopsy results were considered positive.
4525,511,"RESULTS: Two hundred and eighteen (218) patients were included, 95% females, with a median age of 54 years and 12 months median duration of sicca symptoms."
4526,511,36 of the biopsies were positive.
4527,511,"33% of patients had positive anti Ro/SS-A anti La/SS-B antibodies, 62% had positive ANA, and 31% positive RF."
4528,511,"A statistically significant association was found between MSGB and anti Ro/SS-A anti La/SS-B, ANA and RF."
4529,511,ANA were the most sensitive antibodies (84%.
4530,511,"95% CI: 75- 92), and the most specific were: Anti Ro/ SS-A and/or anti La/ SS-B (78%."
4531,511,95% CI: 71-85) and RF (78%.
4532,511,95% CI: 69-87).
4533,511,"CONCLUSION: On PSS clinical suspicion, anti Ro/ SS-A y anti La/ SS-B antibodies have a great value to achieve the diagnosis, with MSGB useful for diagnosis of seronegative patients."
4534,511,The results also suggest the importance of ANA and RF for PSS classification.
4535,512,Localized cutaneous nodular amyloidosis (LCNA) is the rarest type of cutaneous amyloidosis.
4536,512,"Typically presenting as waxy nodules on the lower extremities, it demonstrates localized deposition of AL-type amyloid in immunohistologic study and is often associated with focal plasma cell proliferation."
4537,512,"Sjgren syndrome, an autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder, is characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia with lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands."
4538,512,"As shown in case reports, the association of LCNA with Sjgren syndrome is considerable."
4539,512,"Herein, we report a 78-year-old woman with LCNA, who was further surveyed and diagnosed with Sjgren syndrome."
4540,512,"In light of the significant relation between these 2 diseases, further examination for coexistence of Sjgren syndrome in addition to systemic amyloidosis is well warranted."
4541,512,Prompt identification of an underlying Sjgren syndrome in LCNA with polyclonal immunoglobulin amyloid may have important therapeutic consequences.
4542,513,Severe dysphagia in a 54 year-old woman with Sjogren's syndrome with involvement of multiple cranial nerves significantly improved after treatment with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in combination with a swallowing rehabilitation program.
4543,513,The swallowing response was assessed in real time using a videofluoroscope.
4544,513,"Immediate improvement in the tongue retraction force, clearing of the valleculae, increase in laryngeal elevation and shortening of pharyngeal transit time were noted during stimulation."
4545,513,The patient returned to independent oral feeding after 46 sessions of NMES.
4546,513,"After follow-up for 1 year, we found that the patient maintained adequate oral feeding and did not show signs of pulmonary complications."
4547,514,AIM: The evaluation of the salivary scintigraphy is part of the classification criteria of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
4548,514,The aim of the study was to determine a method of quantitative evaluation of this technique with easy application and high diagnostic accuracy.
4549,514,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: A review was carried out on a total of 111 patients with clinical suspicion of SS, referred to our department over the last 4 years (94 women, range 14-82 years)."
4550,514,"Thirty-minute dynamic studies were performed after injection of (99m)Tc-pertechnetate, with secretory stimulus at 15 minutes."
4551,514,"After drawing regions of interest in both parotids, submandibular glands, and in the background, quantitative parameters were determined."
4552,514,"These included the ejection fraction, uptake ratio at 15 min, and the percentage uptake (PC)."
4553,514,"Based on the definitive diagnosis, the subjects were classified into patients with SS, with sicca syndrome, and healthy subjects."
4554,514,RESULTS: Significant differences were found between the SS group and healthy subjects in the 3 quantitative parameters for the 4 glands.
4555,514,Significant differences in the PC parameter were observed between the group with sicca syndrome and healthy subjects.
4556,514,ROC analysis showed that the best differentiation parameter for the 3 groups was the PC in both parotid and submandibular glands.
4557,514,"CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative analysis of salivary scintigraphy has proved to be a useful method and easy to apply in daily practice to differentiate patients with SS from healthy subjects, with the PC, both in parotid and submandibular glands, being the parameter with highest diagnostic accuracy."
4558,515,BACKGROUND: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) development in Sjgren's syndrome (SS) remains a potentially lethal complication and efforts should focus on the identification of predictors that could aid in appropriate therapeutic decisions.
4559,515,"METHODS: In order to identify potential prognostic factors for outcome in SS-associated NHL, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 77 patients, diagnosed with NHL according to WHO classification criteria and meeting the American-European Consensus Classification (AECC) criteria for SS and examined the effect of SS-activity (defined as the EULAR SS disease activity index-ESSDAI) in the prognosis of SS-related NHLs, as defined in terms of overall and event-free survivals (OS and EFS)."
4560,515,"An event was defined as lymphoma relapse, treatment failure, disease progression, histological transformation or death."
4561,515,The effect of NHL clinical and laboratory characteristics was also investigated.
4562,515,RESULTS: MALT lymphomas constituted the majority (66.2%) of lymphomas.
4563,515,"During the follow-up (median = 57.93 months), the 5-year OS was 90.91% (95% CI: 82.14-95.80%) and the EFS was 77.92% (95% CI: 67.37-85.82%)."
4564,515,"Patients with high ESSDAI score at lymphoma diagnosis had a greater risk for death (OR = 5.241, 95% CI: 1.034-26.568) or for event (OR = 4.317, 95% CI: 1.146-9.699, p = 0.008)."
4565,515,"These patients had also significantly worse EFS (HR = 4.541, 95% CI: 1.772-11.637) and OS (HR = 5.946, 95% CI: 1.259-28.077)."
4566,515,"In addition, post-chemotherapy ESSDAI improvement was significantly lower in patients who had experienced an event (p = 0.005)."
4567,515,"An unfavorable International prognostic index (IPI) score (high-intermediate/high) was associated with high risk of death and event (OR = 13.867, 95% CI: 2.656-72.387 and OR = 12.589, 95% CI: 3.911-40.526, respectively), worse EFS (log-rank p<0.001, HR = 8.718, 95% CI: 3.477-21.858), as well as with worse OS (log-rank p<0.001, HR = 11.414, 95% CI: 2.414-53.974)."
4568,515,"After adjustment for identified risk factors, IPI score retained a significant prognostic role following by a strong effect of ESSDAI in survival outcomes."
4569,515,"CONCLUSIONS: At the point of NHL diagnosis, IPI and ESSDAI might be proved useful predictive tools in SS-associated lymphoma prognosis, directing to a more patient-tailored approach."
4570,516,"Sjgren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease with multisystem involvement characterised by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands resulting in keratoconjunctivitis sicca, xerostomia and bilateral parotid gland enlargement."
4571,516,Renal manifestation is characteristically chronic lymphocytic tubulointerstitial nephritis.
4572,516,Diabetes mellitus in Sjogren's syndrome has also been described in literature.
4573,516,In this article we discuss two cases of Sjogren's syndrome with diabetes mellitus and renal manifestations.
4574,517,AIM: This study investigated the common initial clinical presentations of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and explored differences between sicca and non-sicca onset pSS-ILD patients.
4575,517,METHOD: A total of 1341 SS patients hospitalized between 2003 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed.
4576,517,"Of them, 102 were analyzed and recruited to examine the differences between non-sicca and sicca onset."
4577,517,RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of pSS-ILD patients presented with non-sicca onset.
4578,517,"Although the mean diagnosis time was equal, only 4% of non-sicca onset patients were diagnosed with pSS at onset versus 34% with sicca onset (P=0.000)."
4579,517,"Hyperglobulinemia, elevated rheumatoid factor (RF) titer, and anti-SSA and/or anti-SSB presence were less predominant in patients with non-sicca onset (immunoglobulin G, 16 [12-21] vs. 21 [15-28] g/L, P=0.032; RF, 22 [20-171] vs. 104 [20-237] IU/mL, P=0.048; anti-SSA and/or anti-SSB presence, 33% vs. 72%, P=0.000)."
4580,517,The usual interstitial pneumonia pattern was more commonly seen in non-sicca onset patients (20.0% vs. 14.3%).
4581,517,"The high-resolution computed tomography score was higher (12 [88-15] vs. 8 [5-13], P=0.070) and predicted total lung capacity and forced vital capacity were lower (8723% vs. 9720%, P=0.050; 8828% vs. 10027%, P=0.089) in non-sicca patients."
4582,517,CONCLUSION: Non-sicca is a common initial manifestation in pSS-ILD.
4583,517,"Anti-SSA presence, elevated RF titer and hyperglobulinemia were less predominant, and pulmonary complications were more progressive and severe in non-sicca onset patients than sicca onset patients."
4584,518,OBJECTIVES: Patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) are at a higher risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
4585,518,"However, little is known with regard to the risk of developing cancers other than NHL."
4586,518,The authors aimed in this study to compare the incidence of cancer in various sites among patients with pSS with the general population of Taiwan.
4587,518,METHODS: The authors used National Health Insurance claims data to establish a nationwide population cohort of 7852 patients with pSS from 2000 to 2008 who did not have cancer prior to diagnosis of pSS.
4588,518,Incidence and standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for cancer in various sites were calculated.
4589,518,"RESULTS: Among patients with pSS, 277 (2.9%) developed cancer."
4590,518,The SIR for cancer was 1.04 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.18) among patients of all ages with pSS and was 2.19 (95% CI 1.43 to 3.21) for patients aged 25-44 years.
4591,518,"Female patients with pSS had a higher risk of NHL (SIR 7.1, 95% CI 4.3 to 10.3), multiple myeloma (SIR 6.1, 95% CI 2.0 to 14.2) and thyroid gland cancer (SIR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4 to 4.3) and a lower risk of colon cancer (SIR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.65)."
4592,518,"In contrast, male patients with pSS were not at a higher risk of developing cancer in particular sites."
4593,518,"CONCLUSION: Patients with pSS, overall, did not have higher risk of cancer, and only patients aged 25-44 years were at an increased risk of cancer compared with their counterparts in the general population."
4594,518,"Cancer screening for patients with pSS, especially female patients, should focus on NHL and multiple myeloma and thyroid gland cancer."
4595,519,Salivary gland ultrasonography is a promising tool for the evaluation of Sjgrens syndrome.
4596,519,Cumulative data suggest that ultrasonography is comparable with older imaging modalities such as sialography and scintigraphy.
4597,519,"However, certain issues remain to be addressed before it can be integrated into current or future classification systems."
4598,520,OBJECTIVE: We analysed the correlation between magnetic resonance images of the parotid and submandibular glands and the salivary flow rate in patients with Sjgren's syndrome.
4599,520,"METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed magnetic resonance images (heterogeneous signal-intensity distribution and gland volume on T1- and fat-suppressed T2-weighted images, and multiple high-signal-intensity spots on magnetic resonance sialograms in the parotid and submandibular glands) obtained from 66 patients who were diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome."
4600,520,We evaluated the relationship between these imaging features and their salivary flow rates in stimulated and unstimulated conditions.
4601,520,"RESULTS: We found that as the disease progressed, both the heterogeneous signal-intensity distribution and the volumes of the parotid and the submandibular glands were significantly related to the stimulated and the unstimulated salivary flow rate."
4602,520,These imaging features were more highly correlated in assessments of the submandibular gland than in those of the parotid gland for both stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow rates.
4603,520,CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance image features of heterogeneity and smaller volume in the submandibular gland are reliable for predicting hyposalivation related to the progression of Sjgren's syndrome.
4604,521,Recent advancements in mass spectrometric proteomics provide a promising result in utilizing saliva to explore biomarkers for diagnostic purposes.
4605,521,"However, the issues of specificity or redundancy of disease-associated salivary biomarkers have not been described."
4606,521,This systematic review was therefore aimed to define and summarize disease-related salivary biomarkers identified by mass spectrometry proteomics.
4607,521,Peer-reviewed articles published through July 2009 within three databases were reviewed.
4608,521,"Out of 243 articles, 21 studies were selected in this systematic review with conditions including Sjgren's syndrome, squamous cell carcinoma, dental caries, diabetes, breast cancer, periodontitis, gastric cancer, systemic sclerosis, oral lichen planus, bleeding oral cavity, and graft-versus-host disease."
4609,521,"The sample size ranged from 3-41 in both diseased and control subjects, with no consensus on sample collection protocol."
4610,521,"One hundred eighty biomarkers were identified in total; 87 upregulated, 63 downregulated, and 30 varying based on disease."
4611,521,"Except for Sjgren's syndrome, the majority of studies with the same disease produce inconsistent biomarkers."
4612,521,Larger sample size and standardization of sample collection/treatment protocol may improve future studies.
4613,522,"BACKGROUND: Sjgren's syndrome is one of the more common inflammatory rheumatological diseases, with a prevalence of at least 0.4% in Germany."
4614,522,METHODS: This review is based on pertinent articles retrieved by a selective search in PubMed.
4615,522,Special attention is drawn to updated classification criteria and current treatment recommendations.
4616,522,"RESULTS: Sjgren's syndrome has a wide variety of presentations, ranging from the local involvement of exocrine glands with keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia (the leading signs of the disease) to the systemic, extraglandular involvement of multiple organs."
4617,522,Fatigue also markedly worsens the patients' quality of life.
4618,522,Serologic testing reveals antinuclear auto-antibodies (anti-Ro/ SSA and anti-La/SSB) as well as rheumatoid factors.
4619,522,The histological hallmark of the disease is focal lymphocytic infiltration in otherwise normal-appearing glandular acini.
4620,522,"The disease also markedly elevates the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the B-cell series, which arises in about 5% of patients."
4621,522,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) differs from the secondary form (sSS), which appears in the setting of another autoimmune disease, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (15-36%), rheumatoid arthritis (20-32%), and limited or progressive systemic sclerosis (11-24%)."
4622,522,Disease-modifying therapy is reserved for patients with systemic involvement; there is limited evidence for its efficacy.
4623,522,"Because of the complexity of this disease, some of its clinical manifestations may require interdisciplinary treatment."
4624,522,"CONCLUSION: The main considerations in the interdisciplinary care of patients with Sjgren's disease are measures to improve quality of life, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments to keep disease activity in check, and management of the risk of lymphoma."
4625,522,Future therapeutic approaches must take the heterogeneity of the disease into account.
4626,523,Primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS)-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) involved about 10-20% of patients.
4627,523,"In 20% of cases, ILD can be diagnosed before pSS; anyway, few studies have investigated the frequency of ILD as the first clinically relevant manifestation of pSS, generally referred to retrospective studies."
4628,523,"Aim of our prospective study was to describe prevalence, clinical, serological, and instrumental features of non-sicca onset pSS patients with interstitial lung involvement."
4629,523,"During a period of 48months, all consecutive patients diagnosed as pSS were enrolled."
4630,523,"For all patients, the reason for the first visit was recorded."
4631,523,"When present, ILD was categorized as definite, possible, or inconsistent with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, according to the current criteria."
4632,523,"ILD was the main presenting symptom in 13/77 new diagnoses of pSS patients; in particular, 6/13 patients were initially diagnosed as idiopathic ILD, and only later developed clinical manifestations suggestive for pSS; ILD-pSS patients were older than others and showed a higher EULAR primary Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index."
4633,523,A radiologic definite or possible UIP pattern was detected in 12/13 pSS.
4634,523,"For the first time, we prospectively observed a prevalence of 16.8% of non-sicca onset pSS patients with ILD."
4635,523,"Interestingly, UIP pattern was the most frequently detected, while typical autoantibodies were often absent."
4636,523,"These features stressed the importance of differential diagnosis in the first stage of the disease, considering the possible poorer prognosis in this subgroup of patients."
4637,523,"Multidisciplinary approach is crucial for a correct and early diagnosis, at both onset and follow-up."
4638,524,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS), an autoimmune, multi-factorial disorder, affects around 5% of females and 0.5% of males in the general population."
4639,524,"The dental practitioner has a key role in recognising the clinical features of this condition, organising referral for specialist care and managing the oral health of these patients."
4640,524,"In this article, we summarise the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management of SS relevant to dental practitioners."
4641,525,"Anti-Ma2/Ta antibodies are rare paraneoplastic antibodies, which are mostly associated with limbic encephalitis in male patients with testicular cancer."
4642,525,We report on a 50-year-old woman with a pure progressive spastic paraparesis.
4643,525,"Next, she was diagnosed as having a Sjgren syndrome, with serological positivity for anti-SS-Ro antibodies."
4644,525,"The patient's serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples were positive for anti-Ma2/Ta antibodies, which were also proved to be intrathecally produced."
4645,525,"These findings, and the coexistence of systemic autoimmunity, led us to treat the patient with corticosteroids first, and then with plasma exchange."
4646,525,Neurological symptoms scarcely responded to both the therapies.
4647,525,The search for cancer was negative up to 4 years after the disease onset.
4648,525,Our case expands the spectrum of clinical syndromes associated with anti-Ma2/Ta antibodies.
4649,526,We report an asymptomatic mother of a cutaneous neonatal lupus child was diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome suspected after parturition.
4650,526,A 30-year old woman was visited our hospital to evaluated autoimmune disease because her baby was diagnosed as cutaneous neonatal lupus.
4651,526,Both gum test and Schirmer's test were positive.
4652,526,"Antinuclear antibody, anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibody were positive."
4653,526,Serum IgG was elevated (2918 mg/dl).
4654,526,"Finally, this case was suspected as Sjgren's syndrome."
4655,526,Continuoues follow-up of asymptomatic mothers of a neonatal lupus child is warranted.
4656,527,"OBJECTIVES: To correlate the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) 146a/b, 16, the 17-92 cluster and 181a in salivary and plasma samples taken from primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients with clinical, laboratory and ultrasound findings."
4657,527,"METHODS: Plasma and salivary samples were collected from 28 patients with pSS according to 2012 ACR and/or 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria (27 females, mean age 64.410.1 years, mean disease duration 10.76.9 years), and from 23 healthy subjects used as controls."
4658,527,"The following patient data were recorded: ESSDAI and ESSPRI scores, anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibody status and laboratory data, Schirmer's test, ultrasound scores of the four major salivary glands according to Cornec et al., and concomitant treatments."
4659,527,"The retro-transcribed and quantified miRNAs were: miR16-5p, miR17-5p, miR18a-5p, miR19a-5p, miR19b-1-5p, miR20a, miR92-5p, miR146a-5p, miR146b-5p, miR181a-5p."
4660,527,RESULTS: SS patients had higher expression of salivary miR146a than gender- and age-matched controls (p=0.01).
4661,527,"Spearman's regression analysis revealed that salivary miR146b was significantly more expressed in the patients with worse ESSPRI scores (p=0.02), whereas salivary miR17 and 146b and plasma miR17 expression was lower in the patients with higher ultrasound scores (respectively p=0.01, p=0.01 and p=0.04)."
4662,527,Salivary miR18a expression was significantly increased in the patients who were anti-La/SSB positive (p=0.04).
4663,527,Neither salivary nor plasma miRNAs correlated with disease duration or concomitant therapies.
4664,527,"CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that salivary mi146a may represent a marker of the disease, and that the expression of salivary miR17, 18a and 146b may be altered in patients with pSS, and associated with worse ultrasound and ESSPRI scores and anti-La/SSB positivity."
4665,528,The paper describes a case of a rare coexistence of primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS) and sarcoidosis in a 41-year-old female with histologically verified lung and locomotor system diseases and keratoconjunctivitis sicca.
4666,528,"PSS was diagnosed based on the 2012 ACR classification criteria, in the framework of which serological, histological, and gland function tests and instrumental diagnostic methods were performed."
4667,528,"The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was based on clinical, radiographic, and histological findings."
4668,529,AIM: To assess the prevalence of secondary Sjgren's syndrome (sSS) and its association with joint damage in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from northern India.
4669,529,"METHODS: Patients included had RA, fulfilling the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria, with disease duration of more than 1 year."
4670,529,They were administered a sicca questionnaire that included six questions from subjective criteria of American European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria.
4671,529,Those who answered affirmatively to at least one question underwent Schirmer I test (ocular function) and salivary scintigraphy (salivary gland involvement).
4672,529,Patients with involvement of both were classified as having sSS as per AECG criteria.
4673,529,A damaged joint count was done using Norfolk Arthritis Register Damaged Joint Count (NOAR-DJC).
4674,529,"RESULTS: This study included 199 patients with RA, with mean (SD) age and disease duration of 44 (9.9) and 6.8 (5.5) years, respectively."
4675,529,"The prevalence of sicca symptoms and sSS was 14.6% and 5.5%, respectively."
4676,529,"Those having sSS had a longer (mean  SD) disease duration (9.2  4.0, 6.8  5.5 years, P = 0.07) and were significantly older in age (50.8  6.8, 43.6  9.9 years, P = 0.005) than those without sSS."
4677,529,"There was no significant difference in the median (interquartile range) damaged joint count (0 (0-2), 0 (0-2), P = 0.75)."
4678,529,"CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of sSS in northern Indian RA patients was 5.5%, and it was significantly associated with older age but not damaged joint count."
4679,530,"The term overlap syndromes (OS) is used to define a group of disorders characterized by the presence, in the same patient, of clinical features typical for more than one definite connective tissue disease (CTD)."
4680,530,OBJECTIVE: To show that patients may not only have an overlap of two or more CTDs but may also change their disease phenotype from that of a definite CTD to another.
4681,530,PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical records of four patients with a disease duration of about thirty years and a transition from a well definite CTD into another.
4682,530,"RESULTS: The first patient was diagnosed, at the beginning of the 1980s, as affected by diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) and developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) twenty-five years later."
4683,530,"The second and the third patients were diagnosed with SLE at the beginning of their disease: the second patient developed, in the course of her disease, an overlap syndrome (OS) SSc/rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the third SSc and finally microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)."
4684,530,The fourth patient was diagnosed as primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) then as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and finally developed SLE.
4685,530,CONCLUSIONS: Patients may not only show an overlap of two or more CTDs but also a transition from a well definite CTD into another.
4686,530,"We propose the term ""transitional connective tissue diseases"" (TCTDs) to define their disease."
4687,530,"A higher number of patients may allow us to better identify this new subgroup of CTDs and probably, also, predictors of evolution."
4688,531,OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate an international set of classification criteria for primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) using guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).
4689,531,These criteria were developed for use in individuals with signs and/or symptoms suggestive of SS.
4690,531,"METHODS: We assigned preliminary importance weights to a consensus list of candidate criteria items, using multi-criteria decision analysis."
4691,531,"We tested and adapted the resulting draft criteria using existing cohort data on primary SS cases and non-SS controls, with case/non-case status derived from expert clinical judgement."
4692,531,We then validated the performance of the classification criteria in a separate cohort of patients.
4693,531,"RESULTS: The final classification criteria are based on the weighted sum of five items: anti-SSA/Ro antibody positivity and focal lymphocytic sialadenitis with a focus score of 1 foci/4mm(2), each scoring 3; an abnormal Ocular Staining Score of 5 (or van Bijsterveld score of 4), a Schirmer's test result of 5mm/5min and an unstimulated salivary flow rate of 0.1mL/min, each scoring 1."
4694,531,Individuals with signs and/or symptoms suggestive of SS who have a total score of 4 for the above items meet the criteria for primary SS.
4695,531,"Sensitivity and specificity against clinician-expert-derived case/non-case status in the final validation cohort were high, that is, 96% (95% CI92% to 98%) and 95% (95% CI 92% to 97%), respectively."
4696,531,"CONCLUSION: Using methodology consistent with other recent ACR/EULAR-approved classification criteria, we developed a single set of data-driven consensus classification criteria for primary SS, which performed well in validation analyses and are well suited as criteria for enrolment in clinical trials."
4697,532,PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT) of the parotid gland for Sjgren's syndrome in comparison with conventional X-ray sialography.
4698,532,METHODS: CT scans and X-ray sialography were performed in 34 patients with confirmed Sjgren's syndrome and 22 symptomatic controls without the disease.
4699,532,CT data from 57 asymptomatic controls were included for quantitative analysis.
4700,532,"The CT findings of heterogeneity, abnormal diffuse fat tissue deposition, diffuse punctate calcification, swelling or atrophy, nodularity or cystic changes of the parotid gland were analyzed by two independent blinded readers."
4701,532,The correlation between CT and X-ray sialography findings was evaluated.
4702,532,Diagnostic performance and receiver operating characteristics curves were calculated.
4703,532,"RESULTS: On CT, heterogeneity of the parotid gland was seen in 30/31 (reader 1/reader 2) Sjgren's syndrome patients by the two readers (sensitivity 88.2%/91.2%; specificity 100%/90.9%)."
4704,532,Abnormal diffuse fat tissue deposition was seen in 28/28 SS patients by the readers (sensitivity 82.3%/82.3%; specificity 100%/90.9%).
4705,532,Diffuse punctate calcification was seen in 10/12 Sjgren's syndrome patients (sensitivity 29.4%/35.2%; specificity 100%/100%).
4706,532,Stagings of CT findings correlate positively with sialography.
4707,532,The areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves were 0.887 (P=0.000) and 0.908 (P=0.000) for the maximum and standard deviation (SD) of the CT value.
4708,532,CONCLUSIONS: Parotid CT is accurate and reliable in the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome.
4709,532,"Heterogeneity, abnormal diffuse fat tissue deposition, and diffuse punctate calcification are specific for Sjgren's syndrome."
4710,532,CT attenuation analysis is helpful in diagnosis.
4711,533,We present the case of 36 yrs old female who presented with acute onset quadriparesis who was subsequently diagnosed to have Sjogrens syndrome with distal RTA with hypothyroidism.
4712,534,"In Europe, ultrasound (US) is the diagnostic gold standard for the visualisation of parotid gland disorders."
4713,534,"While high-resolution B-mode US reliably visualises focal lesions, its diagnostic capacity to distinguish tumour entities or to characterise diffuse lesions remains poor."
4714,534,Strain elastography (SE) and shear wave elastography (SWE) are novel imaging techniques that provide additional information about tissue elasticity.
4715,534,"SE analyses the strain or displacement in response to force or compression and, therefore, shows the relative tissue elasticity within a selected region of interest (ROI)."
4716,534,Recent studies suggest that SE might be able to predict parotid gland malignancy.
4717,534,"In SWE, push pulses generate localised displacements within an ROI that describes mechanical tissue properties expressed in absolute values."
4718,534,Recent studies indicate that SWE can predict tissue fibrosis in different organs.
4719,534,This review article highlights the current role of SE and SWE modalities in diffuse and focal changes of the parotid gland.
4720,535,"BACKGROUND: To study the morphology and the density of conjunctival goblet cells (GC) in patients with Sjgren's syndrome dry eye with in vivo laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), and to explore its correlation with the GC density detected by impression cytology."
4721,535,METHODS: A total of 43 Sjgren's syndrome dry eye patients were recruited.
4722,535,All were required to fill in the Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaires.
4723,535,"The tear break-up time was measured, followed by corneal fluorescein staining examination and Schirmer I test."
4724,535,The images of conjunctiva were taken by the Heidelberg retina tomography (HRT-II)/Rostock cornea module.
4725,535,"Finally, the specimens for impression cytology were obtained."
4726,535,SPSS V.13.0 software was used to analyse the data.
4727,535,RESULTS: Tear film function test showed that all patients had moderate to severe dry eye.
4728,535,The GC in LSCM images was characterised as a large hyper-reflective oval-shape cell with relatively homogeneous brightness.
4729,535,"Though GC density assessed by LSCM (332  137) cells/mm was higher than that measured by impression cytology (200  141) cells/mm, they showed a significant positive correlation,  = 0.908 (p < 0.05)."
4730,535,Conclusion Conjunctival GC could be easily discriminated under the LSCM.
4731,535,LSCM may be a valuable tool in monitoring the progress and the follow-up of patients with Sjgren's syndrome dry eye.
4732,536,Sjogren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by xerophthalmia and xerostomia; it is associated with widespread systemic visceral involvement.
4733,536,"A wide variety of neurological complications are characteristic features of Sjogren's syndrome, of which peripheral neuropathy is a major neurological manifestation."
4734,536,"Based on the predominant neuropathic symptoms, patients can be considered to have several forms of neuropathies, including sensory ataxic neuropathy, painful sensory neuropathy without sensory ataxia, multiple mononeuropathy, multiple cranial neuropathy, trigeminal neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and radiculoneuropathy."
4735,536,"Acute or subacute onset is observed more frequently in multiple mononeuropathy and multiple cranial neuropathies, whereas disease progression is usually chronic in other forms of neuropathies."
4736,536,"Sensory symptoms without substantial motor involvement are observed predominantly in sensory ataxic, painful sensory, trigeminal, and autonomic neuropathies."
4737,536,"In contrast, motor impairment is apparent in multiple mononeuropathy, multiple cranial neuropathy, and radiculoneuropathy."
4738,536,"Autonomic symptoms such as abnormal pupils and orthostatic hypotension are particularly noted in patients with sensory ataxic, painful, trigeminal, and autonomic neuropathies."
4739,536,Sural nerve biopsy specimens reveal predominantly large fiber loss in sensory ataxic neuropathy and predominantly small fiber loss in painful sensory neuropathy.
4740,536,Vasculitis is observed most frequently in multiple mononeuropathy.
4741,536,The autopsy findings of patients with sensory ataxic and painful neuropathies demonstrate neuronal loss in the dorsal root ganglia and sympathetic ganglia with CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
4742,536,Differential therapeutic responses to corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin can be seen among the various neuropathic forms.
4743,536,"In conclusion, the clinicopathological features of neuropathies associated with Sjogren's syndrome are highly variable."
4744,536,The neuropathy classification is important from a therapeutic point of view.
4745,537,INTRODUCTION: Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that apart from involving the exocrine glands can affect any organ.
4746,537,Involvement of the peripheral nervous system results in a wide spectrum of neuropathic manifestations.
4747,537,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinico-electrophysiological patterns as well as pathological characteristics of neuropathy in SS patients presenting to a neuromuscular clinic in a tertiary hospital from South India.
4748,537,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study from the Departments of Neurology, Rheumatology, and Pathology from Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences."
4749,537,"Twenty-one patients with the diagnosis of SS and peripheral neuropathy, seen between 2010 and 2016 were analyzed."
4750,537,"Clinical records, conventional nerve conduction studies, and lip and nerve biopsy reports were collected."
4751,537,RESULTS: Twenty one patients with SS had associated neuropathy.
4752,537,Female-to-male ratio was 2:1.
4753,537,"In 14 (66.7%) patients, neuropathy was the initial manifestation, while in 4 (20%), exocrinopathy preceded neuropathy."
4754,537,"The patterns of neuropathy included mononeuropathy multiplex (MNM) in 7 patients (30%), ganglionopathy in 4 (20%), length-dependant trigeminal autonomic neuropathy, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) in 2 (10%), and cranial neuropathy in 1 (10%)."
4755,537,Eighteen (86%) were seropositive with either anti Ro/SS-A or anti La/SS-B antibodies.
4756,537,Schirmer's test was positive in 13 (61.9%) patients.
4757,537,Nerve biopsy showed vasculitis in 5 patients and demyelinating and axonopathy in 2 patients each.
4758,537,CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that neuropathy is frequently the initial presentation of SS.
4759,537,MNM is the most common pattern followed by ganglionopathy.
4760,537,The pattern of neuropathy helps in arriving at the diagnosis of SS.
4761,537,Serology is a useful initial laboratory test.
4762,537,"However,confirmation of SS is not by mere serology."
4763,537,"Schirmer's test and lip biopsy are equally essential for the diagnosis, especially in seronegative patients when the clinical index of suspicion is high."
4764,538,There are only six cases in literature that describe development of dystonia with Sjogren's syndrome (SS).
4765,538,"We describe a case of a 43-year-old woman who presented with symptoms including movement disorder, sensory neurogenic bladder, sensory loss and neuropathic pain, migraine like headaches, musculoskeletal pain, Raynaud's phenomenon and dysautonomia."
4766,538,"Symptoms started in 2000, with weakness that progressed to dystonia in 2003."
4767,538,"Diagnostic work-up was inconclusive with negative inflammatory serologies, cerebrospinal fluid and MRI for many years."
4768,538,"After patient developed sicca syndrome with dry eyes and mouth in 2009, her rheumatoid factor titre was elevated (550 IU/mL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-Sjogrens syndrome-related antigen A (anti-Ro/SSA) and anti-SSB/La: anti-Sjogrens syndrome-related antigen B (anti-La/SSB) became positive."
4769,538,Lip biopsy confirmed diagnosis of SS.
4770,538,She was diagnosed with primary SS with neurological involvement.
4771,538,Her symptoms responded well to intravenous methylprednisolone.
4772,538,Symptoms stabilised with trials of immune-suppressive therapy.
4773,538,This is a case that demonstrates the delay of diagnosing SS with preceding unique neurological association.
4774,539,Inflammation has been associated with higher cardiovascular risk in rheumatic autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus.
4775,539,"More recently, primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) was also demonstrated as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, emerging as a new interesting model to study atherosclerosis in autoimmune diseases."
4776,539,Patients with pSS have a higher prevalence of developing traditional cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension and dyslipidaemia predisposing for endothelial dysfunction and premature atherosclerosis.
4777,539,"However, the disease-specific mechanisms for premature atherosclerosis in pSS are not fully understood."
4778,539,The aim of this review was to critically analyse the current literature on cardiovascular risks in pSS and to discuss the traditional and disease-associated risk factors.
4779,539,"We also suggest possible new mechanisms that should be explored in future research to close the current knowledge gaps on the association of pSS, premature atherosclerosis, and clinical cardiovascular disease."
4780,540,OBJECTIVES: Clinical features of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) overlap with those of fibromyalgia (FM).
4781,540,This cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of FM in pSS patients and to compare the clinical features of pSS patients with FM to those without FM.
4782,540,METHODS: One hundred pSS patients were consecutively assessed to identify the presence of FM according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2010 criteria.
4783,540,Clinical and laboratory data were collected from all patients.
4784,540,Additional assessments included EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) and EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI).
4785,540,The severity of depression was measured by Hamilton depression rating scale 17-items (HAM-D scale).
4786,540,RESULTS: The prevalence of FM was 31.0% (31/100) in pSS.
4787,540,"Widespread pain index and symptom severity scale were significantly correlated with ESSPRI (r=0.6542 and r=0.7173, both p<0.0001) and HAM-D scale (r=0.6734 and r=0.6471, both p<0.0001) in pSS."
4788,540,"In multivariate analysis, ESSPRI and HAM-D scale were independently associated with increase of tender point count and symptom severity scale."
4789,540,ESSPRI was significantly higher in pSS patients with FM compared to those without FM (p<0.0001).
4790,540,"The prevalence of FM in pSS patients with moderate-to-severe depression was significantly higher than those with mild depression or without depression (odds ratio= 10.62, p=0.0009)."
4791,540,Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 levels in pSS patients with FM were significantly (p=0.0072) decreased compared to those without FM.
4792,540,CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that FM was prevalent in pSS.
4793,540,FM was associated with higher ESSPRI and more severe depression.
4794,541,OBJECTIVE: To study longterm work disability and possible predictors in newly diagnosed patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS).
4795,541,"METHODS: Because we wanted to include only patients with full work availability potential, eligible patients were aged 18-62 years."
4796,541,"Fifty-one patients (mean age 46 yrs, range 18-61 yrs, 50 women) diagnosed with pSS between January 2001 and December 2012 were included in the study."
4797,541,"For each patient we randomly selected 4 reference subjects from the general population and matched for age, sex, and area of residence."
4798,541,We linked data to the Swedish Social Insurance Agency and calculated the proportion as well as net days of work disability in 30-day intervals from 12 months before pSS diagnosis until 24 months after .
4799,541,RESULTS: Work disability was increased in patients with pSS in comparison to general population comparators.
4800,541,"At diagnosis, 26% of patients were work-disabled, while 37% and 41% were disabled at 12 and 24 months after diagnosis, respectively (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05 vs baseline)."
4801,541,"Prior work disability status at diagnosis (OR 15.4, 95% CI 2.9-81.9; p = 0.001), concomitant fibromyalgia (OR 10.5, 95% CI 2.0-56.0; p = 0.006), and each additional year of age (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2; p = 0.009) were found to be associated with work disability 24 months after diagnosis."
4802,541,"CONCLUSION: Patients with pSS showed an increased work disability, in comparison with the general population, which increased significantly during the first 2 years after diagnosis."
4803,541,"Work disability at diagnosis, concomitant fibromyalgia, and increasing age, but not anti-SSA/anti-SSB antibodies or disease activity, were associated with longterm work disability."
4804,542,Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) has been reported in association with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
4805,542,Drug-induced AIH has been rarely reported.
4806,542,A rare case of the co-development of AIH and SS in a 53-year-old woman after the consumption of herbal medicines is described.
4807,542,"After admission, the patient complained of dryness in her mouth, and she was subsequently diagnosed with SS, which had not been detected previously."
4808,542,"The patient's bilirubin and aminotransferase levels initially decreased following conservative management; however, they later began to progressively increase."
4809,542,A diagnosis of AIH was made based on the scoring system proposed by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group.
4810,542,"The patient was administered a combination of prednisolone and azathioprine, and the results of follow-up liver-function tests were found to be within the normal range."
4811,542,This is an unusual case of AIH and SS triggered simultaneously by the administration of herbal medicines.
4812,543,"OBJECTIVES: To validate the ACR-EULAR classification criteria for primary SS (pSS), and compare them to the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and ACR criteria in a Dutch prospective diagnostic cohort."
4813,543,"METHODS: Consecutive patients (n = 129) referred for suspicion of pSS underwent a multidisciplinary evaluation, including a labial and/or parotid gland biopsy."
4814,543,Patients with an incomplete work-up (n = 8) or associated systemic auto-immune disease (n = 7) were excluded.
4815,543,"The ACR-EULAR classification was compared with expert classification, AECG and ACR classification."
4816,543,"Additionally, the accuracy of individual ACR-EULAR items in discriminating pSS from non-pSS was evaluated."
4817,543,The validity of criteria sets was described separately using parotid or labial gland biopsy results for classification.
4818,543,"RESULTS: Of the 114 evaluated patients, the expert panel classified 34 (30%) as pSS and 80 (70%) as non-pSS."
4819,543,"Using labial gland biopsy results, ACR-EULAR classification showed 87% absolute agreement ( = 0.73) with expert classification, with a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 83%."
4820,543,"Using the parotid gland biopsy results, the ACR-EULAR criteria performed excellently as well."
4821,543,"Focus score, anti-SSA titre and ocular staining score showed good to excellent accuracy, whereas unstimulated whole saliva and Schirmer's test had poor accuracy."
4822,543,The ACR-EULAR and AECG criteria had equal validity.
4823,543,"Compared with ACR classification, ACR-EULAR classification showed higher sensitivity but lower specificity."
4824,543,"CONCLUSION: The ACR-EULAR criteria showed good agreement with expert classification, but some patients may be misclassified as pSS."
4825,543,Unstimulated whole saliva and Schirmer's test showed poor discriminative value.
4826,543,"The ACR-EULAR criteria performed equally to the AECG criteria, and had higher sensitivity but lower specificity than the ACR criteria."
4827,544,OBJECTIVE: To describe the spectrum of autonomic dysfunction in a uniformly evaluated cohort of patients with Sjgren syndrome.
4828,544,"METHODS: A series of 13 patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation for suspected autonomic impairment, including a neurological examination, autonomic testing, and laboratory studies."
4829,544,A diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome was established as the cause of autonomic dysfunction in all.
4830,544,"Clinical features, findings on autonomic testing, and laboratory results are described."
4831,544,RESULTS: All patients in this series reported postural lightheadedness and syncope or near-syncope.
4832,544,Autonomic testing confirmed the presence of orthostatic hypotension on tilt-table testing in 5 patients and an excessive postural tachycardia and/or hypertensive response in 8 patients.
4833,544,Only 2 of the patients with orthostatic hypotension had a significant sensory neuropathy.
4834,544,"Symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal and genitourinary impairment were seen in nearly all patients, with abnormal motility testing (most frequently esophageal dysmotility) in 5 of 6 patients who underwent formal testing."
4835,544,Patients in this series treated with immune-modulating therapy experienced significant improvement.
4836,544,CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome should be aggressively pursued in patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of autonomic nervous system impairment.
4837,544,"Although the spectrum of adrenergic failure is variable, ranging from orthostatic hypotension to an excessive postural tachycardia, most patients do have symptoms of more generalized autonomic failure."
4838,544,Patients who were treated with immune-modulating therapy did improve.
4839,545,"OBJECTIVE: Several studies have demonstrated that primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is associated with reduced productivity; however, the impact of primary SS on daily function is not fully understood."
4840,545,"This study aims to assess the physical function of primary SS patients and determine the relationship between the functional impairment experienced by primary SS patients and disease activity, patient-reported symptoms, and quality of life."
4841,545,"METHODS: Sixty-nine primary SS patients from a specialist clinical service were assessed for their functional ability (Improved Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]), dryness, pain, and overall primary SS-related symptom burden; systemic disease activity; levels of fatigue, daytime somnolence, anxiety, and depression symptoms; quality of life; and systemic inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein [CRP] level)."
4842,545,Data were compared to 69 healthy volunteers matched for age and sex.
4843,545,RESULTS: Primary SS patients experienced greater functional impairment than controls (Improved HAQ total scores: mean  SD 24  25 for primary SS versus 9  19 for controls; P = 0.0002) across all domains of activity.
4844,545,"In primary SS, functional impairment was significantly associated with physical fatigue (P < 0.0001, R(2) = 0.3), pain (P < 0.0001, R(2) = 0.3), depression (P < 0.0001, R(2) = 0.3), total symptom burden (P < 0.0001, R(2) = 0.3), systemic disease activity (P = 0.002, R(2) = 0.15), quality of life (P < 0.0001, R(2) = 0.3), dryness (P = 0.002, R(2) = 0.12), daytime somnolence (P = 0.02, R(2) = 0.08), anxiety score (P = 0.03, R(2) = 0.07), and CRP level (P = 0.04, R(2) = 0.06)."
4845,545,"Only CRP level is independently associated with functional impairment ( = 0.38, P = 0.025)."
4846,545,CONCLUSION: Primary SS patients experience significant functional disability compared to age-matched healthy controls.
4847,545,"Impaired function is associated with reduced quality of life and symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and depression, as well as disease activity, illustrating the importance of optimal management of all aspects of the disease."
4848,546,Diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is complex and the usefulness of labial minor salivary glands biopsy in this process remains controversial.
4849,546,OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the clinical and laboratorial profile and histological features on labial minor salivary glands from patients under investigation of SS.
4850,546,STUDY DESIGN: clinical charts from 38 patients under suspicion of SS and submitted to labial minor salivary glands biopsies were reviewed.
4851,546,Clinical and laboratorial data were retrieved from the clinical files and the HE-stained histological slides were reviewed under light microscopy.
4852,546,"RESULTS: mean age of the patients was 56.5 years and 97% were females; histological analysis showed that 42% of the cases showed ductal dilatation, lymphocytic foci were found in 52.6% and, from this group, 80% of the cases presented a foci/lobules ratio above 0.8."
4853,546,Acinar/ductal ratio was considered diminished in 39.5% of the samples.
4854,546,"Thirty six (95%) and 32 (84%) patients, respectively, complained about xerostomia and xerophthalmia."
4855,546,A study of the time interval of the symptoms that led to SS investigation showed a mean of 116 months.
4856,546,"Moreover, sixty-six percent of the patients had already been submitted to immunosuppressive therapy prior to the labial minor salivary gland biopsy."
4857,546,"Age of the patients, scintigraphic alterations on salivary function, antinuclear factor (ANF), anti-Ro and anti-La did not show statistical significant association with the histological features."
4858,546,Lobules/foci ratio above 0.8 was the only histological parameter statistically associated with Sjgren's syndrome diagnosis (p<0.0001).
4859,546,"CONCLUSIONS: in the studied sample, lymphocytic foci on salivary glands were the only histological parameter associated to the diagnosis of SS."
4860,546,Early indication of labial minor salivary gland biopsy to patients under investigation of SS could limit the effects of immunosuppressive therapy on the histological features associated with the evolution of salivary gland involvement in SS.
4861,547,To characterize the distinctive chest high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) features and clinical manifestations of primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS)-related interstitial lung disease (ILD).
4862,547,"The demographic data, clinical manifestations, and laboratory and radiological findings of 527 pSS patients were retrospectively analyzed."
4863,547,ILD was defined based on the presences of pulmonary signs in HRCT.
4864,547,"Two hundred six of 527 patients were diagnosed as pSS-ILD, and the prevalence was 39.1%."
4865,547,"The three most frequent abnormalities in HRCT were reticular pattern (92.7%), ground-glass attenuation (87.4%), and bronchovascular bundle thickening (82%)."
4866,547,"One hundred twenty-four cases (60.2%) of the pSS-ILD patients had only a single HRCT pattern, which involved 86 non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) cases (41.7%), 22 usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) cases (10.68%), 8 organizing pneumonia (OP) cases (3.9%), and 8 lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) cases (3.9%), respectively."
4867,547,"Besides, the more important observation was that 82 cases had no less than two HRCT patterns, and NSIP admixed with OP (43.9%), NSIP admixed with UIP (35.4%), and NSIP admixed with LIP (19.5%) were the most frequent."
4868,547,"HRCT of pSS-ILD patients demonstrated bilateral infiltrates (99%), with abnormalities predominantly in the lower lobes (89.3%) and subpleural areas (81.1%), and a few lesions were characterized by hilum distributed (8.7%)."
4869,547,"Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) revealed impaired diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and total lung capacity, and the rate of small airway lesions in the pSS-ILD patients was 3.5 times higher in patients of pSS."
4870,547,"Logistic regression analysis showed that dry cough (OR 59.05), clubbing (OR 6.26), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (OR 21.38) and positive anti-Ro (OR 7.86) were relevant factors of pSS-ILD."
4871,547,ILD is the common pulmonary involvement of pSS and the prevalence of pSS-ILD is 39.1%.
4872,547,"The single pattern of NSIP and UIP in HRCT are the commonest, and about 40% of the pSS-ILD patients possess multiple patterns in HRCT."
4873,547,The classification of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis cannot completely include the pulmonary imaging features of pSS-ILD.
4874,548,OBJECTIVES: Acute systemic inflammation and chronic systemic vasculitis are associated with endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic plaque formation.
4875,548,"Studies on cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) are limited, with conflicting results."
4876,548,This meta-analysis aimed to explore the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in pSS.
4877,548,METHODS: A comprehensive search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed from date of inception through August 2017.
4878,548,The inclusion criterion was observational studies evaluating the association between pSS and cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular event.
4879,548,"Outcomes are diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke or haemorrhagic stroke."
4880,548,The pooled odds ratio (OR) of the cerebrovascular event or cardiovascular disease and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect meta-analysis to compare risk between patients with pSS and controls.
4881,548,The between-study heterogeneity of effect-size was quantified using the Q statistic and I2.
4882,548,"RESULTS: Data were extracted from 10 observational studies involving 165,291 subjects."
4883,548,"Pooled result demonstrated a significant increase in risk of having cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular event in pSS patients compared with controls (OR=1.28; 95% CI: 0.11-1.46, p value<0.01, I2=68%)."
4884,548,"Subgroup analyses showed no difference in risk for cerebrovascular event (OR=1.31; 95% CI: 0.96-1.79, p value=0.09, I2=71%), but an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (OR=1.30; 95% CI: 1.09-1.55, p value=0.003, I2=74%)."
4885,548,CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown an increased risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease in patients with pSS.
4886,548,These results support multiple studies' finding of increased arterial stiffness in patients with pSS.
4887,549,BACKGROUND: Xerostomia is a symptom that can be triggered by chronic diseases such as Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and lupus erythematosus (LE).
4888,549,Many authors regard most cases of salivary hypofunction in LE to secondary SS.
4889,549,Others believe that salivary changes in patients with LE might reflect a multisystem presentation of the disease.
4890,549,The present study compared histopathological and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) alterations in salivary glands of patients with xerostomia and diagnosis of LE or SS.
4891,549,METHODS: Twenty-eight salivary gland biopsies from patients with xerostomia and diagnosed with LE or SS were submitted to histopathological and DIF exams.
4892,549,"RESULTS: From the 28 patients, 16 had SS and 12 had LE."
4893,549,"In SS, a moderate to intense sialadenitis was detected, with infiltration and destruction of excretory salivary ducts."
4894,549,"In LE, mild/moderate sialadenitis with thickening and hyalinization of the ductal basement membrane was observed."
4895,549,"DIF revealed that 50% of SS patients presented intercellular ductal IgA deposits, whereas 58% of LE patients showed deposits of IgG in the ductal basement membrane."
4896,549,"CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in salivary glands of LE patients may be a specific manifestation of the disease (lupus sialadenitis), reflecting its multisystemic presentation, instead of an association of secondary SS and LE."
4897,550,"The purpose of this study was to investigate salivary tissue assessment with various sonoelastographic modalities (real-time tissue elastography, Virtual Touch imaging and quantification) in patients with Sjgren's syndrome as compared with an appropriate control group."
4898,550,The sonoelastographic modalities were evaluated in 50 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
4899,550,Patients underwent high-resolution ultrasonography of the submandibular and parotid glands.
4900,550,"Results of B-mode, real-time tissue elastography, Virtual Touch imaging-each graded with the appropriate scoring system-and Virtual Touch quantification were compared with those for 50 patients with sicca symptoms who did not fulfill the American-European consensus group criteria."
4901,550,"In B-mode, 34 of 50 parotid glands in patients with pSS and 8 of 50 in the control group had abnormal findings (p<0.001)."
4902,550,"Compared with 9 of 50 control patients, 38 of 50 patients with pSS had abnormal findings in submandibular gland B-mode (p<0.001)."
4903,550,"With real-time tissue elastography, there was a trend toward higher scores for parotid glands in the pSS group (p=0.238), whereas scores for submandibular glands in the control group were higher (p=0.107)."
4904,550,Virtual Touch imaging did not indicate any difference (p=0.647 and p=0.658).
4905,550,"In Virtual Touch quantification, values for parotid (mean: 2.99m/s) and submandibular glands (mean: 2.54m/s) in the pSS group were higher than those for parotid (mean: 2.16m/s) and submandibular (mean: 2.04m/s) glandsinthe control group (p<0.001 and p=0.008)."
4906,550,"Glandular stiffness, measured by Virtual Touch quantification, was significantly higher in patients with Sjgres syndrome than in patients with sicca symptoms."
4907,551,Classification of the wide variety of autoimmune diseases that can occur before or after the onset of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is currently debated within the conventional SS criteria or as primary SS (pSS) developing autoimmune disease or as 'associated-overlap' with other systemic autoimmune diseases.
4908,551,There is also debate on whether or not to consider annular polycyclic subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) and annular erythema associated with Sjgren's syndrome (AESS) as a spectrum linked to Ro-SSA and/or La-SSB auto-antibodies (SSA/SSB auto-ab).
4909,551,"We present the case of a 55-year-old female patient, with pSS positive for SSA and SSB auto-ab, who developed chronic relapsing polymyositis and atypical annular non-polycyclic SCLE lesions resembling AESS, which seemed to suggest a common spectrum."
4910,551,"While a chronic-progressive polymyositis may be generally accepted as a relatively rare myositis complicating pSS, interpretation of annular lesions of non-systemic SCLE in SS patients might actually be underestimated as pSS skin manifestation likely related to SSA/SSB auto-ab."
4911,552,"Over the years, several different criteria sets have been proposed for the classification of Sjgren's syndrome (SS), but none of them has been widely adopted by the scientific community until the publication of the 1993 Preliminary European Classification criteria."
4912,552,These Classification criteria have been largely employed both in clinical practice and in observational and interventional studies for many years.
4913,552,In 2002 the Preliminary European Criteria were re-examined by a joint American and European Committee.
4914,552,"The result of this revision were the American and European Consensus Group classification criteria (AECG-criteria) which introduced more clearly defined rules for classifying patients with primary or secondary SS, and provided more precise exclusion criteria."
4915,552,These AECG-criteria set is now considered to be valid to ensure a specific diagnosis of SS by the vast majority of the expert in the field.
4916,552,"To date, the AECG-criteria have been cited more than 1.304 in literature and have been used to estimate the point prevalence of the disease in several studies conducted in Greece, UK, Turkey and Norway."
4917,552,"However, when employed in epidemiologic studies or in daily practice, the AECG-criteria have demonstrated a higher specificity (75%), but a lesser sensitivity (65.7%) in comparison to the previous Preliminary European criteria, indicating an average prevalence of pSS at ~ 0.2% in the adult population, which is far lower than previously reported."
4918,552,"In this paper we will critically analyse the ""pro and cons"" of the current AECG-criteria and of the potential usefulness of some potential revisions."
4919,553,Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the exocrine glands.
4920,553,The diagnosis is largely based on keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia in the presence of anti-SS-A and/or SS-B antibodies.
4921,553,Anticentromere antibodies (ACA) have occasionally been reported in patients with pSS.
4922,553,"We describe two patients with pSS associated with ACA, initially diagnosed as limited systemic sclerosis."
4923,553,"Symptoms at the time of initial presentation were dry eyes and mouth, arthralgias, and Raynaud's phenomenon."
4924,553,"Both patients developed small vessel cutaneous vasculitis, parotid enlargement, low C4 complement levels, positive rheumatoid factor, and lymphoma."
4925,553,These findings suggest that patients with pSS who have ACA may be a subgroup of patients at increased risk of extraglandular systemic manifestations and lymphoma.
4926,554,AIM: To analyze the relationship between ectopic germinal centers (GCs) in the salivary glands and the clinical/laboratory characteristics of patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
4927,554,"METHODS: Retrospectively, 126 patients with primary SS (pSS) and 16 patients with secondary SS (sSS) were analyzed."
4928,554,Minor salivary gland biopsies were evaluated for the presence of GC-like morphology by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for CD21.
4929,554,Clinical and serological data were obtained from medical records.
4930,554,RESULTS: GC-like structures were observed in 36/126 (28.6%) pSS patients and 4/16 (25.0%) sSS patients.
4931,554,"The mean inflammatory focus score of the gland was significantly higher in GC-positive samples than in GC-negative ones in both pSS and sSS patients (P = 0.007 and 0.024, respectively)."
4932,554,"In pSS, significantly elevated titers of rheumatoid factor (RF)-IgM (P = 0.023) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (P = 0.036), increased levels of IgA (P = 0.012) and IgG (P = 0.017) were encountered in GC-positive patients."
4933,554,"The GC-positive group also presented higher prevalence of anti-SSA antibodies, lower levels of white blood cells, higher levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and -globulin, although not statistically significant."
4934,554,"In sSS patients with ectopic GC formation, ANA titers were remarkably elevated."
4935,554,"The anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP)-IgG titers and the prevalence of antikeratin antibody (AKA)-IgG, antiperinuclear factor (APF)-IgG were also increased, yet not significantly."
4936,554,GCs were found to be associated with antibody and immunoglobulin production.
4937,554,CONCLUSION: This study indicates that SS patients with ectopic GCs have distinct features.
4938,554,"Ectopic GC structures were particularly noted in patients with higher focus scores, and might play an essential role in sustaining antibody production as well as B cell activation."
4939,555,Immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing disease (IgG4-RSD) is a fibroinflammatory condition that has the potential to affect nearly every organ system.
4940,555,Classic histological findings include storiform fibrosis and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-positive plasma cells.
4941,555,"The clinical features of IgG4-RSD may be an under-recognized disease process that can mimic other autoimmune disorders, including Sjogren's syndrome."
4942,555,"We describe a rare case of IgG4-RSD involving the salivary glands, initially misdiagnosed as Sjogren's syndrome."
4943,555,Clinical features of IgG4-RSD can mimic those of other autoimmune disorders affecting the head and neck.
4944,555,"Therefore, otolaryngologists should have IgG4-RSD on their differential when evaluating patients with diffuse salivary gland swelling."
4945,555,"Laryngoscope, 126:2242-2245, 2016."
4946,556,OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between salivary ultrasonography (sUS) findings and disease activity and damage in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS).
4947,556,We investigated the potential prognostic role of sUS as a tool in the assessment of disease activity.
4948,556,"METHODS: In 303 pSS patients, disease activity was assessed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), the EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), the Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (SSDAI) and the Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Damage Index (SSDDI)."
4949,556,The sUS parenchymal inhomogeneity (de Vita scoring system) was assessed in 303 pSS patients and 111 heathy controls.
4950,556,A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the cut-off value of the pathological sUS score.
4951,556,Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess risk factors for moderate and high disease activity.
4952,556,RESULTS: A pathological sUS score  2 was recorded in 271 (89.7%) patients and 8 (8.6%) healthy controls.
4953,556,"Patients with moderate and high ESSDAI and SSDAI scores had significantly higher US activity in comparison to that of pSS patients with low disease activity (p = 0.006; p = 0.01, respectively)."
4954,556,"Additionally, pSS patients with moderate and high SSDDI scores had higher US activity (p = 0.031)."
4955,556,Pathological sUS correlated with the glandular domain within the ESSDAI and SSDDI (p<0.001).
4956,556,The patients with a severe US score (5-6) had a 3.5 times greater chance of having moderate or high disease activity.
4957,556,"The specificity of the severe de Vita sUS score for ESSDAI and SSDAI was 85.1% and 85.2%, respectively."
4958,556,"In contrast, the sensitivity of a severe de Vita sUS score for ESSDAI was low, at 29.2%, while the sensitivity for the SSDAI was higher, 42.3%."
4959,556,"In the analysis of disease activity, a de Vita score  5 could be used as a risk factor for moderate and high ESSDAI (p = 0.042) and SSDAI (p = 0.006)."
4960,556,CONCLUSIONS: Pathological salivary gland ultrasonography is associated with high disease activity and damage in pSS.
4961,556,"Consequently, sUS abnormalities might be surrogate items for glandular domains in the assessment of disease activity and damage."
4962,556,"Thus, ultrasonography of the salivary gland combined with clinical and serological markers might be part of the next prognostic and therapeutic algorithm in the near future."
4963,557,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that affects typically the exocrine glands causing mucosal dryness."
4964,557,Dry eyes and mouth are considered by far the most common and early symptoms of the disease but systemic complications may also occur.
4965,557,"In 1993, the preliminary European criteria were proposed and widely accepted, consisting of both subjective and objective criteria."
4966,557,"Almost ten years later, these classification criteria were revised by introducing more stringent rules and precise diagnostic procedures leading to the currently used American-European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria."
4967,557,The AECG criteria have been largely employed to conduct epidemiologic and clinical studies of patients with SS and proved to be more specific compared to the preliminary European criteria.
4968,557,"The recent American College of Rheumatology/Sjgren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (ACR/SICCA) criteria that are based exclusively on objective tests, the stringency of the AECG criteria and the potential therapeutic use of biologic agents in SS clearly set the need for new classification criteria."
4969,557,Whether the new diagnostic approach will further encompass subclinical and early forms of the disease remains to be addressed by the scientific community.
4970,558,A 64-year-old woman presented with bilateral optic neuropathy leading to a diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome.
4971,558,She improved with high-dose corticosteroids and oral azathioprine and was subsequently found to have asymptomatic bilateral iridocyclitis.
4972,558,"Although central nervous system manifestations of Sjgren syndrome are documented in the literature, they are not widely recognized in clinical practice."
4973,558,Associated optic neuritis often mimics demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis.
4974,558,Treatment of CNS disease related to Sjgren syndrome is highly controversial.
4975,558,Uveitis is an uncommon finding associated with Sjgren syndrome.
4976,559,PURPOSE: We attempted to evaluate the diagnostic value of different salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) scoring systems for primary sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
4977,559,METHODS: Total 134 patients with pSS and 109 non-SS sicca controls were included in our study.
4978,559,"All the cases were evaluated by four scoring systems (such as 0-16 SGUS, 0-3 SGUS, Parotid glands and Submandibular salivary glands scoring system)."
4979,559,The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for the four scoring systems.
4980,559,RESULTS: The mean scores of pSS patients were significantly higher than that of controls by four scoring systems (P<0.01).
4981,559,The AUC (area under the curve) of (0-16) SGUS scoring system (0.916) was higher than Submandibular salivary glands scoring system (0.885) (P=0.016).
4982,559,"No significant difference of AUC was observed in (0-3) SGUS scoring system, compared with 0-16, parotid gland and submandibular salivary glands scoring system."
4983,559,"The optimal cutoff value of (0-16) SGUS, (0-3) SGUS, Parotid gland, Submandibular salivary glands scoring system was 5, 2, 3, 2, respectively."
4984,559,There was no significant difference in the sensitivity and specificity of the four scoring systems.
4985,559,CONCLUSION: The simplified parotid gland scoring system may be the simplified and feasible method for pSS diagnosis.
4986,560,OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical features of childhood Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in comparison to adult SS and to evaluate possible child-specific modifications to existing adult criteria for use in diagnosing childhood SS.
4987,560,"METHODS: We retrospectively identified children (age <18 years) with SS and compared the clinical, laboratory, and histopathological features of these children based on presence or absence of parotitis."
4988,560,We compared these features to adults with SS and evaluated the applicability of existing classification criteria in diagnosing childhood SS.
4989,560,Child-specific modifications to existing criteria were evaluated.
4990,560,RESULTS: Twenty-six children were included in our childhood SS group.
4991,560,Sixteen children had parotitis at or before presentation.
4992,560,Absence of parotitis was associated with greater degree of organ damage based on SS disease damage index.
4993,560,"Compared to 413 adult SS patients, childhood SS was more commonly associated with parotitis, positive serologies, neurologic and nephrologic manifestations, and non-specific features (fever, lymphadenopathy) but less commonly associated with dry mouth and dry eyes."
4994,560,Only a minority of these children met previously established criteria for adult SS.
4995,560,Inclusion of child-specific features such as parotitis and the presence of any focal lymphocytic sialadenitis on minor salivary gland biopsy increased the proportion of children meeting these criteria.
4996,560,"CONCLUSIONS: Childhood SS features may be different than adult SS features necessitating child-specific criteria for better diagnosis of childhood SS, a key step towards better understanding the features, prognosis, and outcomes in this disease."
4997,561,"Bone marrow fibrosis has been found to be associated with autoimmune disorders, and autoimmune myelofibrosis (AIMF) has been defined."
4998,561,"Primary myelofibrosis (PMF), a clonal myeloproliferative disorder, should be distinguished from AIMF which has a good response to steroids, as the former has a high mortality and very bad response to conventional treatment."
4999,561,"This case report describes a rare case of PMF accompanied with Sjgren's syndrome (SJS) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), in a patient with trisomy 8 mosaic."
5000,561,"Careful clinical assessment, gene mutation screening, and bone marrow evaluation can lead to an accurate diagnosis."
5001,562,There is limited knowledge about dietary intake and body composition among patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome.
5002,562,We assessed dietary intakes with 24-h recalls and body composition with anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance in 20 female patients.
5003,562,Various scoring tools were used to assess oral health.
5004,562,The patients had a lower energy percentage (E%) from carbohydrates (p = 0.02) and a higher E% from fat (p = 0.01) compared to a reference group.
5005,562,"The lower intake of carbohydrates was due to a lower bread intake (p = 0.04), while the higher intake of fat was due to a higher intake of butter, margarine, and oil (p = 0.01)."
5006,562,The patients ate more than twice (p = 0.02) as much fish as the reference group.
5007,562,The compliance to recommended intakes of macro- and micronutrients was good.
5008,562,Forty-percent of the patients were overweight/obese.
5009,562,"Increased intake of beverages was observed in patients with severe xerostomia and/or low oral health-related quality of life, whereas reduced fat intake was found in hyposmic patients."
5010,562,"In conclusion, the dietary intake among the patients was not much different from the reference group and complied with recommendations."
5011,562,Most oral health parameters were not associated with nutrient intakes.
5012,562,Specific dietary guidelines are probably not needed to ensure adequate nutrition among such patients.
5013,563,"BACKGROUND: Although Sjgren's syndrome has been known to complicate with white matter lesions, encephalopathy, or stroke, reports of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis due to Sjgren's syndrome with atypical antibodies are rare."
5014,563,CASE REPORT: A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our neurological ward with nausea and vomiting following acute onset of severe headache in the left occipital region.
5015,563,Brain computed tomography revealed no abnormalities.
5016,563,"The patient was fully conscious, with normal cognitive functioning, but exhibited unsteady tandem gait."
5017,563,Both magnetic resonance venography and computed tomography venography suggested left transverse sinus blockage.
5018,563,"Intravenous enoxaparin, followed by oral warfarin, was initiated as treatment for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis."
5019,563,"After investigation, Sjgren's syndrome was diagnosed and lupus anticoagulant antibody test was positive."
5020,563,"The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, and appeared fully recovered at the 6-month follow-up, with no clinical or radiological signs of relapse."
5021,563,CONCLUSION: This case reports the relationship between cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and Sjgren's syndrome.
5022,563,"It is necessary to screen autoimmune disorders in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis that present with no common risk factors of venous thrombosis in order to prevent inappropriate management, and potentially adverse outcomes."
5023,564,CCR9+T helper (Th) cells can induce Sjgren-like symptoms in mice and both CCR9+Th cells and their ligand CCL25 are increased in the salivary glands of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients.
5024,564,Increased circulating CCR9+Th cells are present in pSS patients.
5025,564,"CCR9+Th cells are hyperresponsive to IL-7, secrete high levels of IFN-, IL-21, IL-17 and IL-4 and potently stimulate B cells in both patients and healthy individuals."
5026,564,Our aim was to study co-expression of chemokine receptors on CCR9+Th cells and whether in pSS this might differentially affect CCR9+Th cell frequencies.
5027,564,"Frequencies of circulating CCR9+and CCR9- Th cells co-expressing CXCR3, CCR4, CCR6 and CCR10 were studied in pSS patients and healthy controls."
5028,564,"CCL25, CXCL10, CCL17, CCL20 and CCL27 mRNA and protein expression of salivary gland tissue of pSS and non-Sjgren's sicca (non-SS) patients was assessed."
5029,564,Chemotaxis assays were performed to study migration induced by CXCL10 and CCL25.
5030,564,"Higher expression of CXCR3, CCR4 and CCR6 but not CCR10 was observed on CCR9+Th cells as compared to cells lacking CCR9."
5031,564,"Decreased frequencies of circulating memory CCR9+CXCR3+ Th cells were found in pSS patients, which was most pronounced in the effector memory subset."
5032,564,Increased salivary gland CCL25 and CXCL10 expression significantly correlated and both ligands functioned synergistically based on in vitro induced chemotaxis.
5033,564,Decreased memory CXCR3+CCR9+ Th cells in blood of pSS patients may be due to a concerted action of overexpressed ligands at the site of inflammation in the salivary glands facilitating their preferential migration and positioning in the lymphocytic infiltrates.
5034,565,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic orphan disease.
5035,565,It is characterized by the involvement of epithelial tissues leading to the term of autoimmune epithelitis.
5036,565,New classification criteria have been developed in 2016.
5037,565,New scores have also been developed: a patient-reported outcome called ESSPRI and a score assessing systemic activity of the disease called ESSDAI.
5038,565,These new tools are very helpful to better stratify patients and to customize the management of this very heterogeneous disease.
5039,565,"Among the autoimmune diseases, SS is associated with the highest risk of lymphoma."
5040,565,Five to ten percent of the patients will have a B cell lymphoma mostly a low-grade lymphoma developing from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).
5041,565,"Major advances have been made in this field: pathogeny is better understood, new predictors are available and progresses have been made in the management of this severe complication."
5042,565,Research in the field of SS is very dynamic as illustrated by the high number of therapeutic trials.
5043,565,"There is hope that these innovations, reviewed in the present article, will have potential significant repercussions for the patients in the next few years."
5044,566,Salivary glands are frequent sites of manifestations of autoimmune disorders in the head and neck.
5045,566,"Sjgren syndrome, sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and IgG4-related sialadenitis represent the most important autoimmune salivary gland disorders."
5046,566,"Due to the lack of specific symptoms, diagnosis of these conditions remains a challenge."
5047,566,"Diagnosis is usually based on classification criteria involving clinical tests, histopathological evaluation, and serological examinations."
5048,566,"Depending on the disease, biomarkers are of different value and have to be interpreted carefully."
5049,566,"In Sjgren syndrome, antibodies against Ro/SS-A and La/SS-B are essential and part of established classification criteria."
5050,566,"In sarcoidosis, biomarkers such as angiotensin-converting enzyme, serum amyloid A, adenosine deaminase, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor are not suitable to confirm a diagnosis due to low sensitivity and specificity, but allow a differentiation between active and inactive disease."
5051,566,"In patients with suspected granulomatosis with polyangiitis, positivity for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) allows a diagnosis without histopathological confirmation in selected cases."
5052,566,"In the head and neck, limited manifestations are common, in which less patients are positive for ANCA and histopathological confirmation is required."
5053,566,Diagnosis of IgG4-related sialadenitis solely based on elevated IgG4 serum levels is not possible.
5054,566,The concentration of blood plasmablasts is reported to have a higher diagnostic value.
5055,567,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is characterized by hypofunction of the salivary and lacrimal glands.
5056,567,The salivary function is largely dependent upon the blood supply in the glands.
5057,567,"However, the diseased states of the gland perfusion are not well understood."
5058,567,The arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique allows noninvasive quantitative assessment of tissue perfusion without the need for contrast agent.
5059,567,"Here, we prospectively compared the perfusion properties of the parotid glands between patients with SS and those with healthy glands using ASL MR imaging."
5060,567,We analyzed salivary blood flow (SBF) kinetics of 22 healthy parotid glands from 11 volunteers and 28 parotid glands from 14 SS patients using 3T pseudo-continuous ASL imaging.
5061,567,SBF was determined in resting state (base SBF) and at 3 sequential segments after gustatory stimulation.
5062,567,"SBF kinetic profiles were characterized by base SBF level, increment ratio at the SBF peak, and the differences in segments where the peak appeared (SBF types)."
5063,567,"Base SBFs of the SS glands were significantly higher than those of healthy glands (59.2  22.8 vs. 46.3  9.0 mL/min/100 g, p = 0.01)."
5064,567,"SBF kinetic profiles of the SS glands also exhibited significantly later SBF peaks (p < 0.001) and higher SBF increment ratios (74  49% vs. 47  39%, p = 0.04) than the healthy glands."
5065,567,The best SBF criterion (= 51.2 mL/min/100 mg) differentiated between control subjects and SS patients with 71% sensitivity and 82% specificity.
5066,567,"Taken together, these results showed that the SS parotid glands were mostly hyperemic and the SS gland responses to gustatory stimulation were stronger and more prolonged than those of the healthy glands."
5067,567,The ASL may be a promising technique for assessing the diseased salivary gland vascularization of SS patients.
5068,568,BACKGROUND: A more severe disease phenotype has been reported in men compared to women in several rheumatic diseases.
5069,568,"However, studies have not conclusively established sex-related clinical features in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
5070,568,"In this study, we therefore investigated the clinical presentation of pSS in women and men at diagnosis."
5071,568,"METHODS: Incident, treatment nave patients (n=199) during a 5-year period in a specified area were prospectively included and examined for items of classification criteria for pSS as well as extraglandular manifestations (EGM)."
5072,568,Serum was sampled at the time of diagnosis and anti-Ro52/SSA levels were measured by ELISA.
5073,568,"Replication of significant findings was confirmed in an independent cohort of pSS patients (n=377), and meta-analysis was performed."
5074,568,"RESULTS: An increased frequency of extraglandular manifestations in men was observed and replicated (p=0.05, p=0.0003, and p(meta)=0.002)."
5075,568,"This related to pulmonary involvement, vasculitis, and lymphadenopathy being more common in men, for whom a lower age at diagnosis was observed in the exploratory cohort."
5076,568,"Additionally, SSA-positive male patients had significantly higher levels of anti-Ro52 levels than their female counterparts in sera available for analysis (p=0.02)."
5077,568,CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of two independent cohorts of incident pSS demonstrates that the presence and number of EGM are significantly more frequent among men with pSS than women at diagnosis.
5078,568,"Importantly, around half of the male patients presented with more than one EGM at diagnosis, supporting the conclusion that pSS in men represents a more severe form of disease, regardless of the lower risk for men to develop pSS."
5079,569,"Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue is a normal component of the lung's immune system and may be analogous to gut-associated lymphoid tissue, a form of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue."
5080,569,"Bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma is a distinct subgroup of low-grade B-cell extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma, classified as marginal-zone lymphoma."
5081,569,It is a rare disorder and appears with a distinct clinical and radiological presentation.
5082,569,"We report a case of a patient with a history of Sjogren's syndrome who presented with bilateral pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and who was diagnosed as having bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma."
5083,570,OBJECTIVES: To identify biomarkers for disease activity in IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) and primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
5084,570,"METHODS: Forty-three consecutive treatment-nave patients with IgG4-RD, 62 patients with pSS, and 5 patients with sicca syndrome were enrolled."
5085,570,"IgG4-RD and pSS disease activity was assessed based on the IgG4-RD responder index (IgG4-RD RI) and EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ES- SDAI), respectively."
5086,570,The associations of biomarkers with disease activity were examined.
5087,570,"RESULTS: Comparison of the three dis- eases identified the serum levels of IgG, IgG4, IgG4/IgG ratio, IgE, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) for IgG4-RD and the serum levels of IgM and sIL-2R and lymphocyte counts for pSS as potential biomarkers of disease activity."
5088,570,"Among these, serum sIL-2R levels correlate with baseline IgG4-RD RI scores and the number of affected organs in IgG4-RD (=0.74, p<0.0001 and =0.75, p<0.0001, respectively)."
5089,570,"Serum sIL-2R levels also correlate with ESSDAI scores and the number of af- fected organs in pSS (=0.67, p<0.0001 and =0.41, p<0.0001, respectively)."
5090,570,"Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested serum sIL-2R levels as an efficient biomarker to distinguish the presence of extra-dacryosialadenitis involvements in IgG4-RD with a cut-off value of 424 U/mL (AUC=0.93, p<0.0001), and in pSS with 452 U/mL (AUC=0.89, p<0.0001)."
5091,570,Serum sIL-2R levels decreased significantly after treatment in patients with IgG4-RD and pSS.
5092,570,CONCLUSIONS: Serum sIL-2R levels are a potentially valuable biomarker for evaluating disease activity and treatment response in IgG4-RD and pSS.
5093,571,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility disorders have a similar clinical picture, although dysmotility disorders require the attention of a specialist."
5094,571,Patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) have also been described to suffer from IBS-like symptoms.
5095,571,No objective marker is available to distinguish between the patients.
5096,571,A visual analogue scale has been developed for IBS patients (VAS-IBS) to measure treatment response of GI symptoms and well-being in patients with IBS.
5097,571,"The aim of the present study was to examine if VAS-IBS could be used to compare the degree of GI complaints in different patient populations, to get an objective marker to differentiate between the patients."
5098,571,"METHODS: The VAS-IBS consists of 7 VAS scales, namely, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, bloating and flatulence, vomiting and nausea, psychological well-being and the intestinal symptoms' influence on daily life."
5099,571,"Consecutive female patients suffering from IBS, dysmotility disorders and pSS were asked to complete the VAS-IBS questionnaire when visiting the out-patient clinics."
5100,571,"In addition, a control population consisting of healthy female volunteers was included."
5101,571,"RESULTS: Healthy volunteers had almost no GI symptoms, whereas all 3 patient groups expressed symptoms."
5102,571,There was no statistical significant difference between IBS and dysmotility in any of the scales besides vomiting and nausea (p = 0.044).
5103,571,"Except for constipation, patients with pSS had less severe symptoms than the others."
5104,571,CONCLUSION: The VAS-IBS questionnaire could be used to assess the level of GI symptoms.
5105,571,"However, VAS scores do not help the clinicians to differentiate between IBS and other dysmotility disturbances."
5106,572,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated sub-clinical cardiovascular involvement in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients by means of ADMA, coronary flow reserve (CFR), intima media thickness (cIMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and myocardial deformation."
5107,572,"METHODS: The study involved 22 outpatients with pSS (6 males, 16 females; mean age 60.147.81 years) and no documentable cardiovascular disease, and 22 age- and gender-matched controls."
5108,572,Dipyridamole transthoracic stress echocardiography was used to evaluate wall motion and CFR.
5109,572,A CFR value of <2.5 was considered a sign of impaired coronary function.
5110,572,"We also evaluated cIMT arterial stiffness PWV and plasma ADMA levels, and made a speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) analysis."
5111,572,RESULTS: All of the patients were affected by pSS.
5112,572,"Although within the normal range, the patients' CFR was lower than that of the controls (median 2.70; IQR 2.40-2.90 vs. 3.20; IQR 3.06-3.33; p<0.0001), whereas their ADMA levels were significantly higher (median 0.81 M; IQR 0.79-0.85 M vs. 0.54 M; IQR 0.52-0.58 M; p<0.0001)."
5113,572,"Both left and right PWV values were significantly higher in the patients than in the controls (median 8.8 m/s right and 8.9 m/s left vs. 6.86 and 6.89 m/s), whereas QIMT was substantially similar in the two groups."
5114,572,"CONCLUSIONS: Higher ADMA levels suggest the presence of endothelial dysfunction and sub-clinical atherosclerosis in pSS patients, even in the case of a normal CFR."
5115,572,"This finding is supported by the PWV values, which were higher in the pSS patients."
5116,572,ADMA levels and PWV values may be useful markers for identifying early endothelial dysfunction in pSS patients.
5117,573,OBJECTIVE: The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjgren's Syndrome (SS) Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) and the EULAR SS Patient-Reported Index (ESSPRI) were recently developed.
5118,573,We aimed to determine whether patients' symptoms differed between patients with and without systemic involvement and if the disease-specific indices correlated with each other in primary SS.
5119,573,METHODS: Fifteen French centers included 395 primary SS patients in the Assessment of Systemic Signs and Evolution in Sjgren's Syndrome Cohort.
5120,573,"At enrollment, physicians completed the ESSDAI, the SS Disease Activity Index (SSDAI), and the Sjgren's Systemic Clinical Activity Index (SCAI), and patients completed the ESSPRI, the Sicca Symptoms Inventory, and the Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort."
5121,573,All scores were compared between patients with and without systemic involvement.
5122,573,Correlations between scores of systemic activity and patients' symptoms were obtained.
5123,573,"RESULTS: At enrollment, 120 (30.4%) patients had never experienced systemic complication and 155 (39.2%) patients and 120 (30.4%) patients had, respectively, only past or current systemic manifestations."
5124,573,"Past or current systemic patients had higher levels of symptoms, except dryness."
5125,573,"The ESSDAI did not correlate with the patient-scored ESSPRI (rho = 0.06, P = 0.30), whereas the SSDAI and the SCAI, which include subjective items, did correlate (rho = 0.28 and 0.25, respectively; P < 0.0001 for both)."
5126,573,"CONCLUSION: Alterations of common patient-reported outcomes are present in all patients with primary SS, including those with systemic complications."
5127,573,"However, patient symptoms and systemic complications are 2 different facets of primary SS."
5128,573,"Therefore, the use of both systemic and patients' indices, such as the ESSDAI and ESSPRI, are useful."
5129,573,"Since these 2 facets weakly overlap, one should identify which of both components is the main target of the treatment to test, when designing clinical trials in primary SS."
5130,574,BACKGROUND: We have elucidated decreased resting salivary flow in approximately 60% of patients with autoimmune diseases not complicated by Sjgren syndrome (SjS).
5131,574,"In this study, salivary stimulation tests using capsaicin were performed to examine residual salivary secretion ability in patients with autoimmune diseases."
5132,574,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were divided into three groups: patients with primary or secondary SjS (SjS group), patients with systemic sclerosis not complicated by SjS (SSc group), and patients with other autoimmune diseases (non-SjS/non-SSc group)."
5133,574,Simple filter paper and filter paper containing capsaicin were used to evaluate salivary flow rates.
5134,574,RESULTS: Resting salivary flow rates were significantly lower in the SjS and SSc groups than in the non-SjS/non-SSc group but did not differ significantly between the SjS and SSc groups.
5135,574,"Capsaicin-stimulated salivary flow rates were significantly lower in the SjS and SSc groups than in the non-SjS/non-SSc group, but not significantly different between the SjS and SSc groups."
5136,574,"In the non-SjS/non-SSc group, salivary flow rates increased after capsaicin stimulation to the threshold level for determination of salivary gland dysfunction, whereas no improvement was observed in the SjS and SSc groups."
5137,574,CONCLUSION: Residual salivary secretion ability may be a useful marker for differential diagnosis in autoimmune diseases.
5138,575,"PURPOSE: Although the minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) is a major criterion for the diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome (SS), multiple studies have outlined difficulties in standardization."
5139,575,"The purpose of this study was to answer the following question: in all patients referred for MSGB, did strict application of focus scoring criteria alter the sensitivity of and predictive value of the MSGB in the diagnosis of SS compared with the initial interpretation?"
5140,575,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors designed a cross-sectional study of patients referred to the Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (Boston, MA) over a 5-year period for MSGB."
5141,575,The primary predictor variable was the MSGB focus score.
5142,575,The primary outcome variable was the SS diagnosis.
5143,575,The newly established SS diagnosis status results were compared with the initial SS diagnoses.
5144,575,"Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were calculated."
5145,575,"Other relevant variables of interest, such as size of glandular tissue harvested and associated signs and symptoms, also were documented."
5146,575,The primary predictor variable was the MSGB focus score and the primary outcome variable was the SS diagnosis (positive or negative).
5147,575,RESULTS: Seventy-three patients met the inclusion criteria.
5148,575,"The mean age was 48.5years (range, 19 to 71yr) and 64 were women (87.6%)."
5149,575,"The authors' previous study using initial pathology reports yielded 80.0% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, 57.1% PPV, and 95.5% NPV."
5150,575,"The present review of the MSGB using strict focus scoring guidelines yielded 95.4% sensitivity, 76.4% specificity, 63.6% PPV, and 97.5% NPV."
5151,575,CONCLUSIONS: The MSGB is an important major criterion in establishing a diagnosis of SS.
5152,575,Application of strict focus scoring guidelines when reviewing the MSGB yielded a sensitivity far greater than initially reported in this group.
5153,575,Difficulties with interpretation are discussed.
5154,575,Future studies will focus on improvement of interpretation and immunohistochemical aids in diagnosis.
5155,576,Primary Sjgren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder involving mainly salivary and lachrymal glands.
5156,576,"However, many extraglandular symptoms have also been reported."
5157,576,"Although leucocytopenia and lymphocytopenia are frequently observed in hematological disorders, autoimmune hemolytic anemia is rarely reported."
5158,576,We experienced a case of primary Sjgren's syndrome developing severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
5159,576,"The patient's red blood cells showed spontaneous agglutination in saline at room temperature, and immunoglobulin M (IgM) was detected on the surface of red blood cells by flow cytometry, indicating that autoimmune hemolytic anemia was caused by warm reactive IgM antibodies."
5160,576,Immediate corticosteroid therapy resulted in a dramatic recovery.
5161,576,We report a first case of severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia caused by warm reactive IgM antibodies in primary Sjgren's syndrome.
5162,577,OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to report a case of IgG4-related Mikulicz's disease with a systematic review.
5163,577,METHODS: The relevant English literature was searched using the keywords 'Mikulicz's disease' and 'IgG4'.
5164,577,"Original and review articles were reviewed, and the clinical scenarios were exemplified with a case report."
5165,577,RESULTS: A 49-year-old Caucasian man presented with axillary lymphadenopathy and bilateral parotid/submandibular enlargement.
5166,577,"A chest computerized tomography showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with low metabolic activity on the position emission tomography."
5167,577,"A histopathological study showed an IgG4/IgG ratio of 75% in the plasma cells of the submandibular glands, associated with high levels of total serum IgG and IgG4."
5168,577,"He had dry mouth, but minor salivary gland biopsy was negative without xerophthalmia."
5169,577,"He had nasal obstruction and dyspnea, notably with supine position/cervical rotation, which substantially improved with glucocorticoid treatment."
5170,577,He had newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus with hyperlipasaemia and diffuse pancreatic swelling supportive of autoimmune pancreatitis.
5171,577,"CONCLUSIONS: Our case report supports the literature that there are similarities between IgG4-related Mikulicz's disease and Sjgren's syndrome, but the differences are significant."
5172,577,IgG4-related Mikulicz's disease is a multi-organ lymphoproliferative disease distinct from Sjgren's syndrome.
5173,578,OBJECTIVE: Sjogren's syndrome (SjS) causes salivary gland impairment leading to oral dryness.
5174,578,Parotid sialo-cone-beam computerized tomography (sialo-CBCT) demonstrates ductal architecture and to a lesser extent gland activity.
5175,578,This study characterizes radiographic features of patients suspected for SjS and looks for a possible correlation with the diagnosis of SjS.
5176,578,METHODS: The clinical and radiographic data of suspected SjS/dry mouth patients referred for sialo-CBCT in 2011-2014 were reviewed retrospectively.
5177,578,"Two observers studied the scans for various radiographic features including duct morphology, level of branching, ductopenia and sialectasia."
5178,578,These features were analysed taking the specific clinical data and two sets of SjS criteria: The 2002 American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and the 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Group.
5179,578,RESULTS: Sialo-CBCT scans of 67-referred patients suffering from dry mouth (115 parotid glands) were included.
5180,578,Intraradiographic association was found between ductopenia and all other radiographic parameters.
5181,578,"Minimal, yet important, radiographic differences were found between left and right parotid glands."
5182,578,"AECG-confirmed-SjS patients showed strong correlation with radiographic features, whereas ACR 2012-confirmed-SjS patients did not."
5183,578,CONCLUSION: Sialo-CBCT demonstrates novel radiographic features which may clarify the diagnosis of SjS.
5184,578,Further studies are needed to determine the role of sialo-CBCT in diagnosis of SjS.
5185,579,Ga-pentixafor is a novel radioligand of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4.
5186,579,A 55-year-old woman with a history of primary Sjgren's syndrome underwent Ga-pentixafor PET/CT for staging of lymphoma originating from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.
5187,579,"Whereas no lymphoma manifestation could be detected, imaging revealed bilateral intense radiotracer uptake in both parotid and submandibular salivary glands, consistent with inflammatory cell infiltration."
5188,580,OBJECTIVE: Autoantibodies are highly characteristic of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and represent important tools for studying its pathogenesis.
5189,580,"Nonetheless, thus far, no systematic investigations have assessed the presence of autoantibodies before diagnosis."
5190,580,"This study was undertaken to analyze how early and in what order autoantibodies appear, how predictive they are of primary SS, and whether they identify disease subsets."
5191,580,METHODS: A nested case-control design linking data from the Malm primary SS registry and 3 Swedish healthcare biobanks was applied.
5192,580,"In all, 175 serum samples obtained from 117 individuals before diagnosis of primary SS and 1 serum sample from each of 117 matched controls were analyzed for antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), rheumatoid factor (RF), and antibodies against Ro 60/SSA, Ro 52/SSA, and La/SSB."
5193,580,"RESULTS: Considering all patients with primary SS who were autoantibody positive after diagnosis, at least one autoantibody specificity was detected in 81% up to 20 years (median 4.3-5.1 years) before diagnosis."
5194,580,"Those found most often were ANAs, followed by RF, anti-Ro 60/SSA, anti-Ro 52/SSA, and anti-La/SSB."
5195,580,"Anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies were strongly associated with the risk of developing primary SS, especially early-onset disease and a severe disease course."
5196,580,"When Bayesian prior prevalence estimates for primary SS were included in the calculation, prediagnostic anti-Ro 60/SSA and anti-Ro 52/SSA had the highest positive predictive values (25% and 100%, respectively)."
5197,580,"CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that autoantibodies are present for up to 18-20 years before the diagnosis of primary SS, but we cannot exclude even earlier seropositivity, since for most patients, the earliest sample analyzed was positive."
5198,580,"In families with multiple cases of autoimmune disease, autoantibody profiling, along with assessment of genetic risk, enables identification of susceptible individuals in a predisease state."
5199,581,BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren's Syndrome (PSS) mainly affects women (9:1 female:male ratio) and is one of the commonest autoimmune diseases with a prevalence of 0.1 - 0.6% of adult women.
5200,581,For patients with PSS there is currently no effective therapy that can alter the progression of the disease.
5201,581,"The aim of the TRACTISS study is to establish whether in patients with PSS, treatment with rituximab improves clinical outcomes."
5202,581,"METHODS/DESIGN: TRACTISS is a UK multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, controlled, parallel group trial of 110 patients with PSS."
5203,581,"Patients will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive two courses of either rituximab or placebo infusion in addition to standard therapy, and will be followed up for up to 48 weeks."
5204,581,The primary objective is to assess the extent to which rituximab improves symptoms of fatigue and oral dryness.
5205,581,"Secondary outcomes include ocular dryness, salivary flow rates, lacrimal flow, patient quality of life, measures of disease damage and disease activity, serological and peripheral blood biomarkers, and glandular histology and composition."
5206,581,DISCUSSION: The TRACTISS trial will provide direct evidence as to whether rituximab in patients with PSS leads to an improvement in patient symptoms and a reduction in disease damage and activity.
5207,581,TRIAL REGISTRATION: UKCRN Portfolio ID: 9809 ISRCTN65360827.
5208,582,New 2016 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) have been developed and endorsed by the ACR.
5209,582,The newly proposed criteria include simple-to-perform items.Two important points of the new criteria should be considered.
5210,582,"Firstly, they indicate that either salivary gland biopsy or anti-Ro must be positive in order to corroborate the inflammatory and autoimmune nature of the disease."
5211,582,"Secondly, the criteria recognize the systemic nature of SS, namely that patients without salivary or ocular glandular symptoms, but with extraglandular manifestations and B cell activation markers were also included in the SS classification."
5212,582,"Additionally, the new criteria modified some technical points."
5213,582,The ocular staining score threshold was increased to 5 due to the higher specificity.
5214,582,"The immunological profile includes only anti-Ro antibodies, while positivity for antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor or isolated anti-La was excluded due to a lack of specificity.The 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria are suitable for early identification of SS, providing patients with the opportunity of enrollment in clinical trials for new specific treatment."
5215,582,"Although validation has been successful, the real life application of these criteria will test their performance."
5216,583,OBJECTIVE: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) has a varied clinical spectrum and has been associated with various chest computed tomography (CT) findings.
5217,583,"We sought to delineate the characteristic CT features in various subsets of SS, especially poor prognosis subsets."
5218,583,"METHODS: Retrospectively identified 80 never-smoker SS patients [56 primary SS (1-SS), 24 secondary SS (2-SS)] who underwent chest CT at our institution during a 3-year period from 2004 through 2007 were included in this study."
5219,583,"Chest CT findings were qualitatively and semiquantitatively analyzed with comparison between 1-SS and 2-SS, and correlation with anti-SSB/La seropositivity and the presence of clonally derived lymphoproliferative disorder (cLPD), which are known to be pathognomonic and prognostic clinical features of SS patients."
5220,583,RESULTS: All patients were women with median age of 60 years.
5221,583,Anti-SSB/La antibodies were found in 17 primary SS patients and 4 2-SS patients.
5222,583,Eleven patients with cLPD were identified and all of them had 1-SS.
5223,583,The most frequent CT finding in both types of patients was interlobular septal thickening.
5224,583,Secondary SS was associated with a significantly greater frequency and extent of honeycombing versus 1-SS.
5225,583,Univariate and multivariate analysis showed a significant association between honeycombing and 2-SS.
5226,583,"In patients with 1-SS and in the SS group as a whole, we observed independent and significant associations between cysts and anti-SSB/La seropositivity or cLPD."
5227,583,CONCLUSION: Cysts are significantly associated with anti-SSB/La seropositivity and cLPD.
5228,583,"The presence of lung cysts revealed by chest CT might be a prognostic clinical feature, a clue, or a predictor of cLPD in patients with SS."
5229,584,"The term ""mixed connective tissue disease"" (MCTD) concerns a systemic autoimmune disease typified by overlapping features between two or more systemic autoimmune diseases and the presence of antibodies against the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein autoantigen (U1snRNP)."
5230,584,"Since the first description of this condition in 1972, the understanding of clinical manifestations and long-term outcome of MCTD have significantly advanced."
5231,584,"Polyarthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon, puffy fingers, lung involvement and esophageal dysmotility are the most frequently reported symptoms among the different cohorts during the course of the disease."
5232,584,"Moreover, in recent years a growing interest has been focused on severe organ involvement such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and interstitial lung disease which can accrue during the long-term follow-up and can still significantly influence disease prognosis."
5233,584,"Over the last years, significant advances have been made also in disease pathogenesis understanding and a central pathogenetic role of anti-U1RNP autoantibodies has clearly emerged."
5234,584,"Although controversies on disease definition and classification still persist, MCTD identifies a group of patients in whom increased surveillance for specific manifestations and prognostic stratification became mandatory to improve patient's outcomes."
5235,585,"PURPOSE: To investigate the relationships between tear osmolarity and other ocular surface parameters and to determine the diagnostic value of tear osmolarity in primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) using tear film break-up time, Schirmer I test, and cornea/conjunctiva staining."
5236,585,METHODS: We included 310 eyes of 155 patients diagnosed with dry eye disease (39 primary SS and 116 non-Sjgren dry eye disease) at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital from August 2010 to January 2015.
5237,585,"All subjects completed the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and underwent ocular examinations including tear osmolarity (TearLab Osmolarity System), Schirmer I test, slit lamp examination for tear film break-up time, and corneal and conjunctival fluorescein staining."
5238,585,We used the mean value of both eyes for all parameters.
5239,585,Fluorescein staining was assessed using the Sjgren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance ocular staining score (OSS).
5240,585,"RESULTS: In primary SS patients (n = 39), the mean subject age was 52.5  11.9 years, and 94.9% of the subjects were women."
5241,585,"Mean tear osmolarity in SS was 311.1  16.4 mOsm/L, with 16 (41.0%) subjects having values 316 mOsm/L."
5242,585,"In SS, there was a positive correlation between mean tear osmolarity and OSDI score ( = 0.405, p = 0.011) and OSS ( = 0.592, p < 0.001)."
5243,585,"There was a negative correlation between mean tear osmolarity and the Schirmer I test ( = -0.625, p < 0.001)."
5244,585,"There was no significant correlation between mean tear osmolarity and tear film break-up time in SS ( = 0.110, p = 0.505)."
5245,585,CONCLUSIONS: Tear osmolarity measurements using the TearLab Osmolarity System can reflect both symptom severity (OSDI) and objective signs (Schirmer test and OSS) in SS.
5246,586,Hypokalemic paralysis is a rare presentation of Fanconi syndrome (FS) caused by Sjgren Syndrome (SS).
5247,586,We describe a 39-year-old man who manifested flaccid paralysis of 4 limbs.
5248,586,"Laboratory investigations showed profound hypokalemia (1.6 mmol/L) with renal K wasting, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with positive urine anion gap, hypophosphatemia with hyperphosphaturia, hypouricemia with hyperuricosuria, normoglycemic glycosuria, and abnormal serum creatinine concentration 2.2 mg/dL."
5249,586,"A thorough survey for the cause of FS revealed that he had xerophthalmia and xerostomia accompanied by high anti-Ro antibody, positive Schirmer test, and delayed saliva excretion on sialoscintigraphy, confirming the diagnosis of SS."
5250,586,"Potassium citrate, active vitamin D3, and high phosphate diet for his FS coupled with mycophenolate mofetil for SS resolved clinical symptoms and ameliorated renal function."
5251,586,"Early recognition of HP due to the underlying SS-related FS with prompt therapy not only could terminate potentially life-threatening hypokalemia, but also improve renal outcome."
5252,587,"The current 2002 classification criteria do not cover the broad clinical and immunological heterogeneity of primary Sjgren syndrome (SS), since five of the six criteria focus exclusively on glandular involvement and the remaining criterion is the mandatory presence of anti-Ro/La antibodies."
5253,587,The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical features of patients with a well-established diagnosis of primary SS who do not fulfill the 2002 classification criteria.
5254,587,Five hundred seven patients diagnosed with primary SS (1993 criteria) were consecutively included and followed up.
5255,587,Two hundred twenty-one (44%) patients did not fulfill the 2002 criteria.
5256,587,"These patients were older at diagnosis (p < 0.001) and had a lower frequency of parotid enlargement (p = 0.002), fever (p = 0.041), arthritis (p = 0.041), vasculitis (p = 0.050), peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.002), cranial nerve involvement (p = 0.015), raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR) levels (p < 0.001), anemia (p < 0.001), leukopenia (p = 0.037), hypergammaglobulinemia (p < 0.001), positive rheumatoid factor ( RF; p = 0.002), and cryoglobulinemia (p = 0.049) in comparison with those fulfilling 2002 criteria."
5257,587,"However, there were no significant differences in the prevalence of sicca features, diagnostic tests, overall systemic involvement, antinuclear antibodies , complement levels, development of B-cell lymphoma, or survival."
5258,587,"Patients with anti-Ro antibodies had the highest frequencies of systemic features, hematological abnormalities, and altered immunological markers."
5259,587,"In conclusion, patients fulfilling the 2002 criteria, who have either a specific histological diagnosis (lymphocytic infiltration) or highly specific autoantibodies (Ro/La), might well be considered to have Sjgren ""disease."""
5260,587,"In contrast, etiopathogenic mechanisms other than lymphocytic-mediated epithelial damage could be involved in patients with negative Ro and negative biopsy, in whom the term Sjgren ""syndrome"" seems more adequate."
5261,588,OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness and performance of the American European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria based on minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) in Japanese patients with primary SS.
5262,588,"METHODS: Among 208 MSGB cases, we retrospectively selected 112 subjects who satisfied the complete set of AECG classification criteria."
5263,588,"Of the 112 subjects studied, 63 primary SS patients and 49 non-SS group subjects were classified according to the AECG criteria."
5264,588,The contribution of subjective and objective components was statistically analysed.
5265,588,"RESULTS: Sex, dry eye, Saxon test, Schirmer's test, anti-SSA/Ro antibody, MSGB grading and sialography statistically contributed to the diagnosis."
5266,588,"Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that positive MSGB [odds ratio (OR) 105; 95% CI 13, 849), positive anti-SSA/Ro antibody (OR 96; 95% CI 10, 923), a positive Saxon test (OR 46; 95% CI, 6, 340) and the existence of dry eye (OR 8, 95% CI 2, 43) were associated with the diagnosis of primary SS."
5267,588,"Among the components of the AECG criteria, MSGB and anti-SSA/Ro antibody were very strong contributors."
5268,588,"Furthermore, the abnormal-finding positive rate in sialography significantly correlated with MSGB grading (P-value for trend = 0.0006), although other subjective and objective components were not associated with MSGB grading."
5269,588,CONCLUSION: The usefulness of the AECG criteria for Japanese primary SS patients was confirmed.
5270,589,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that mainly affects the exocrine glands.
5271,589,"It has been reported that the association between SS and respiratory involvement occurs in 11% and 45% of cases, and can be the initial manifestation of the disease."
5272,589,"The diagnosis is based on the integration of clinical, immunological and histopathological criteria."
5273,589,"This paper examines a 58-year-old man with SS, severe dyspnea and recurrent exacerbations associated with bronchiolitis-bronchiectasis."
5274,589,"The absence of anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies associated with severe bronchiolitis is a clinical presentation that is poorly characterized in this group of patients; moreover, how to treat them remains unclear."
5275,590,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of ultrasound of major salivary glands (sUS) compared with parotid and labial gland biopsies, sialometry, anti-SSA/Ro antibody status and classification criteria in patients clinically suspected with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
5276,590,METHODS: 103 consecutive outpatients with clinically suspected pSS underwent sUS.
5277,590,"Parenchymal echogenicity, homogeneity, hypoechogenic areas, hyperechogenic reflections and clearness of salivary gland border were scored according to the Hocevar scoring system."
5278,590,Total ultrasound score was calculated as the sum of these domains (range 0-48).
5279,590,RESULTS: Absolute agreement between sUS and parotid (83%) and labial (79%) gland biopsy outcome was good.
5280,590,"Negative sUS predicts negative parotid gland biopsy, and positive sUS predicts positive labial gland biopsy."
5281,590,"Compared with the American European Consensus Group (AECG) classification, sUS showed an absolute agreement of 82%, sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 92%."
5282,590,"Compared with the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification, absolute agreement was 86%, sensitivity was 77% and specificity was 92%."
5283,590,"Compared with the ACR-European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification, absolute agreement was 80%, sensitivity was 67% and specificity was 94%."
5284,590,"Positive sUS predicts classification, but negative sUS does not exclude classification."
5285,590,The combination of positive sUS with presence of anti-SSA/Ro antibodies or negative sUS with absence of anti-SSA/Ro antibodies showed a high predictive value for classification as pSS or non-pSS.
5286,590,"CONCLUSION: In our prospective inception cohort study derived from daily clinical practice, absolute agreement between sUS and salivary gland biopsies was slightly higher for parotid compared with labial gland biopsies."
5287,590,"The combination of positive sUS and presence of anti-SSA/Ro antibodies highly predicts classification according to the AECG, ACR and ACR-EULAR classification criteria."
5288,591,OBJECTIVE: To comprehend clinical features at onset of primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) in order to provide useful data for its clinical management.
5289,591,"METHODS: In the study, 224 patients diagnosed with pSS in the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology of Peking University People's Hospital from Jun."
5290,591,"1st, 2007 to Aug. 1st, 2008 were investigated, including gender, age of onset, time and site of first hospitalization and definite diagnosis, etc."
5291,591,"RESULTS: In this 224 pSS cohort (213 females and 11 males), the male/female ratio was 1:19.4, the mean age of onset was (53.511.7) years, and median duration was 9.4 years (ranging from 0.2 to 40.0 years).The manifestations showed that up to 33% of the patients (74/224) had leukopenia, 25% (56/224) polyarthralgia, 16.5% (37/224) raynaud phenomenon, 15.6% (35/224) hepatic injury, 12.1% (27/224) pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, 11.6% (26/224) purpuras on lower extremities, 8.0% (18/224) hemogram abnormal, 5.8% (13/224) thrombopenia, and 3.6% (8/224) renal tubule acidosis."
5292,591,"When the risk factor of the systemic involvements, was analyzed, two factors were significantly associated with pulmonary interstitial fibrosis: age (OR=1.074, 95% CI=1.031-1.118), and duration (OR=1.075, 95% CI=1.023-1.128)."
5293,591,"Liver involvement was associated with duration (OR=1.050, 95% CI=1.002-1.100)."
5294,591,"In addition, 8.0% of the pSS patients(18/224)showed family history of autoimmune diseases and 11.2%(25/224)had family history of tumor."
5295,591,"CONCLUSION: In this cohort of the pSS patients, female is predominant and the incidence of extro-glandular manifestations, such as leukopenia, lung and liver involvements is high, and pSS has inheritance intention."
5296,592,"Sjgren syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease affecting exocrine glands, mostly lacrimal and salivary glands."
5297,592,"Rarely, extraglandular sites such as skin, lung, kidneys, and nervous system may be involved."
5298,592,F-FDG PET/CT can be employed in SS for assessment of disease activity and for exclusion of lymphoma.
5299,592,We here present the case of a 61-year-old woman with SS where multisystem involvement was demonstrated on F-FDG PET/CT.
5300,593,Treatment of Sjgren's syndrome is almost entirely symptomatic.
5301,593,A lack of true understanding of the underlying immunological pathology of the disease prevents directed therapy.
5302,593,Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is elevated in the serum of patients with this disease and is expressed by the lymphocytes infiltrating the salivary glands.
5303,593,"The known functions of IL-21 in facilitating differentiation, proliferation, and survival of both B and T cells mesh well with the findings in Sjgren's syndrome."
5304,593,Demonstration of IL-21 as a fundamental aspect of the pathophysiology of Sjgren's syndrome could lead to the development of anti-IL-21 therapy for this disease.
5305,594,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a complex and heterogeneous disease.
5306,594,"Last year, a great deal of basic and clinical research was carried out in pSS."
5307,594,"Following the previous reviews of this publishing series, we will herewith provide a critical digest of the most recent literature on pSS pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and treatment."
5308,594,"More specifically, we will focus on the heterogeneity of the disease, on the underlying pathogenetic pathways and on the possible new targeted treatments on the horizon."
5309,595,"PURPOSE: To analyze clinical features and main causes of multiple sclerosis-related optic neuritis (MS-ON), providing evidence for the differential diagnosis of MS-ON."
5310,595,"METHODS: Clinical data were collected from 527 patients, 123 males and 404 females, diagnosed with MS-ON between June 2008 and June 2013."
5311,595,"Visual acuity, optometry, visual field, slit-lamp microscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy (20D), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed."
5312,595,Venous blood was sampled for detection of autoimmune antibodies and Aquaporin (AQP- 4).
5313,595,"RESULTS: Fifty nine cases were diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica-related optic neuritis (NMO-ON), 27 Sjogren's syndrome-related optic neuropathy, 22 tumors, 21 anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, 15 radiation-induced optic neuropathy, 14 optic neuropathy-related infection, 17 genetic eye diseases and 10 open angle glaucoma."
5314,595,"Among 168 MS-ON patients undergoing optic nerve MRI,90 cases (53.57%) had a lesion < 15 mm in size, 15-30 mm in 76 (45.24%) and > 30 mm in two (1.19%)."
5315,595,"CONCLUSION: MS-ON is more commonly misdiagnosed with NMO-ON and Sjogren's syndrome, when compared to optic neuropathy, tumors and ischemic optic neuropathy."
5316,596,OBJECTIVE: To investigate pregnancy and fetal outcomes in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS).
5317,596,METHODS: An obstetric history of 36 women with established diagnosis of pSS at pregnancy was obtained from a multicenter cohort of 1075 patients.
5318,596,"In a subgroup case-control analysis, 12 deliveries in patients with pSS were compared with 96 control deliveries."
5319,596,RESULTS: Thirty-six women (31 with anti-SSA/Ro and/or anti-SSB/La antibodies) with an established diagnosis of pSS had 45 pregnancies with the delivery of 40 newborns.
5320,596,"Two miscarriages, 2 fetal deaths, and 1 induced abortion were recorded."
5321,596,"Mean age at the first pregnancy was 33.9 years; mean number of pregnancies was 1.25; 18/40 (45%) cesarean births were delivered; mean pregnancy length was 38.5 weeks (range 32-43), with 6 preterm deliveries."
5322,596,"The mean Apgar score at 5 min was 8.9, mean birthweight was 2920 g (range 826-4060 g)."
5323,596,Congenital heart block (CHB) occurred in 2/40 (5%) newborns.
5324,596,The reported rate of breastfeeding for at least 1 month was 60.5%.
5325,596,In 4/40 pregnancies (10%) a flare of disease activity was observed within a year from delivery.
5326,596,"In the case-control subgroup analysis, 12 deliveries were compared with 96 controls and no significant differences were found."
5327,596,"CONCLUSION: Patients with pSS can have successful pregnancies, which might be followed by a mild relapse."
5328,596,CHB was the only cause of death for offspring of mothers with pSS.
5329,597,Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytes infiltration in the exocrine glands.
5330,597,"Central nervous system complications of primary SS are not rare, but ischemic stroke has been rarely reported."
5331,597,"Here we report a 43-year-old female with a two-year history of primary SS, presenting with sudden cerebral infarction."
5332,597,"Her primary SS was diagnosed on the basis of clinical features, high levels of serum anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies, salivary gland secretion evaluation and positive sublingual gland biopsy results."
5333,597,"Magnetic resonance imaging revealed infarct lesions in the parietal and occipital lobes, as well as in the left basal ganglia."
5334,597,Magnetic resonance angiography showed a remarkable stenosis in the left middle cerebral artery.
5335,597,Other differential diagnoses were ruled out.
5336,597,"Corticosteroid and immunosuppressor, together with anti-platelet and statin were effective, and the patient recovered quickly without sequelae."
5337,597,"Based on these findings, vasculitis due to primary SS should be considered among the causes of stroke."
5338,597,The literature was reviewed and the relationship between primary SS and cerebral infarction explored.
5339,597,The pathogenesis of ischemic stroke in primary SS is still unknown and warrants further studies.
5340,598,Primary Sjgren's syndrome is a systemic and chronic autoimmune disease.
5341,598,Renal involvement may occur in up to 30% of patients.
5342,598,The incidence of tubulopathies ranges from 2.6 to 33%.
5343,598,"They are manifested by defects in the urine concentration and hydroelectrolyte alterations, mainly distal tubular acidosis and exceptionally proximal tubular acidosis."
5344,598,These disorders can be associated with nephrocalcinosis and renal lithiasis.
5345,598,We report the case of a patient with primary Sjgren who presented proximal renal tubular acidosis associated with recurrent renal colic due to renal lithiasis and nephrocalcinosis.
5346,598,We highlight the importance of diagnosing renal tubular acidosis in patients with Sjgren's syndrome that present alterations in urinary sediment and electrolyte disorders to avoid nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis.
5347,598,Acidosis correction treatment aims to prevent the progression of the disorder and preserve renal function.
5348,599,We report a rare case of a 38-year-old female who presented with sudden onset flaccid quadriplegia and respiratory arrest with no significant past clinical history.
5349,599,She was later found to have hypokalemia due to distal renal tubular acidosis and further diagnosed as case of Sjogrens Syndrome.
5350,600,OBJECTIVES: To evaluate how determination of antibodies against the Ro52 antigen influences the classification and clinical characterisation of patients with suspected primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
5351,600,"METHODS: The cohort study included 187 patients who fulfilled at least four of the six 1993 SS classification criteria, including positive autoantibodies (antinuclear antibodies [ANA], rheumatoid factor [RF], anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SS-B antibodies) as mandatory criterium."
5352,600,Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies were tested by qualitative ELISA using a commercial assay.
5353,600,Anti-Ro52 antibodies were detected by a semiquantitative ELISA.
5354,600,RESULTS: Anti-Ro52 antibodies were found in 70/187 (37%) patients.
5355,600,"A significant percentage of patients with anti-Ro/SSA antibodies were negative for anti-Ro52 antibodies (22%), while 13 patients (12%) were negative for anti-Ro/SSA antibodies but positive for anti-Ro52 antibodies, meaning that they fulfilled the 2002 SS criteria while avoiding the need for a salivary biopsy."
5356,600,"Higher mean titers of anti-Ro52 antibodies were associated with severe scintigraphic involvement, positive salivary gland biopsy, parotid enlargement, anaemia, leukopenia and RF."
5357,600,"A statistical correlation was found between anti-Ro52 titers and age, gammaglobulin levels, RF titers and serum IgA and IgG."
5358,600,"Patients with positive anti-Ro/SSA and anti-Ro52 antibodies had a higher frequency of positive salivary gland biopsy, parotid enlargement and positive RF, and higher levels of serum IgG and IgA levels in comparison with patients with positive anti-Ro/SSA but negative anti-Ro52 antibodies."
5359,600,"CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Ro52 antibodies were closely associated with the main clinical, histopathological and immunological features of primary SS."
5360,600,"Anti-Ro52 autoantibody testing may help to identify a specific subset of SS patients with more aggressive disease, in whom a closer follow-up and earlier, more robust therapeutic management may be necessary."
5361,601,Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has proven to be sensitive for detecting early injury to the parotid gland in pSS (primary Sjgren's syndrome).
5362,601,"Here, we explored the application of ADC histogram and texture analyses for evaluating the disease activity of pSS."
5363,601,A total of 55 patients with pSS who met the classification criteria of the 2002 AECG criteria prospectively underwent 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including DWI (b=0 and 1000s/mm(2)).
5364,601,"According to the ESSDAI score, 35 patients were categorized into the low-activity group (ESSDAI<5) and 20 into the moderate-high-activity group (ESSDAI5)."
5365,601,"Via analysis of the whole-volume ADC histogram, the ADC(mean), skewness, kurtosis, and entropy values of the bilateral parotid glands were determined."
5366,601,Multivariate analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for predicting disease activity.
5367,601,The diagnostic performance of the indexes was evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
5368,601,"ROC analysis showed that the anti-SSB, lip biopsy, MRI morphology, ADC, ADC(mean), and entropy values were able to categorize the disease into two groups, particularly the entropy values."
5369,601,"The multivariate model, which included anti-SSB, MRI morphology and entropy, had an area under the ROC curve of 0.923 (P<0.001)."
5370,601,"The parotid entropy value distinguished disease activity in patients with pSS, especially combined with anti-SSB and MRI morphology."
5371,602,Lung involvement in primary Sjgren syndrome occurs in approximately 10-20% of patients.
5372,602,"Tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, has demonstrated efficacy and safety in small series of systemic sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, but its effect on interstitial lung manifestations of connective tissue diseases is not well known."
5373,602,We report the use of tocilizumab in a refractory organising pneumonia associated with Sjgren's disease.
5374,602,Our observation suggests that tocilizumab could be an alternative therapeutic in refractory organising pneumonia.
5375,603,Compact bone (cortical or dense bone) is among the organs that contain multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs).
5376,603,"Unlike bone marrow plugs where MSCs were initially isolated, compact bone has minimal (amount of) hematopoietic cells and thus facilitates the MSCs isolation process."
5377,603,"In vitro, MSCs from compact bone show multipotency and differentiation into mesenchymal tissues such as bone, adipose, and cartilage, under certain conditions."
5378,603,MSCs therapy has been promising in preclinical and clinical studies against autoimmune diseases.
5379,603,"Not only can MSCs replace the lost tissue through their regenerative properties, but they can also control the autoimmune attacks by immunoregulatory cytokines."
5380,603,This protocol describes the use of compact bone-derived MSCs to preserve salivary function (saliva flow/output) in the NOD (nonobese diabetic) mouse model affected with Sjogren's-like disease.
5381,604,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by hypofunction of the salivary and lachrymal glands.
5382,604,"Main clinical features of SS are sicca symptoms, due to the altered glandular function."
5383,604,"Also, in advanced stages, bilateral swelling of the parotid glands can be noted, indicative of severe glandular involvement."
5384,604,"Phenotypic expression of various mononuclear cells present in the affected tissue offers additional insight into cellular proliferation, survival, migration, antibody secretion and also the potential of forming tertiary lymphoid tissue, i.e., germinal centers."
5385,604,The main objective of the present study was to evaluate various autoimmune activity patterns present in salivary glands by means of immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis.
5386,604,"The study group comprised of 10 primary SS patients, with various degrees of lymphocytic infiltrates confirmed on minor salivary gland (MSG) biopsy."
5387,604,"We could identify both morphological changes, i.e., ductal system abnormalities or increased interstitial fibrosis, and immunological patterns associated with SS pathogenesis."
5388,604,CD3+ T-cells displayed a more intense reaction in specimens with mild to intermediate focus score (FS) grade.
5389,604,Specimens with important CD20+ B-cell component of lymphocytic infiltrate were associated with intermediate and severe FS grade.
5390,604,"Specimens showed varying degrees of CD68+ cells, with more intense IHC reactions in slides displaying a more advanced mononuclear infiltration."
5391,604,"Immunoreactivity was strong for both MMP-2 and MMP-8 matrix metalloproteinases, throughout the gland, in areas of acini, without it being linked with proximity of mononuclear cell infiltration."
5392,604,We could also establish some correlations between the degree of lymphocytic infiltration and clinical profile.
5393,605,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Capable of multi-organ involvement in Sjogren's syndrome (SS), cardiac findings of pulmonary effusion, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension are seen in patients with SS."
5394,605,Aortic stiffness (AS) reflects the mechanical tension and elasticity of the aorta.
5395,605,"In this study, our aim is to determine if there is any differences in AS and left ventricular function between patients diagnosed as SS and healthy control groups."
5396,605,METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 50 patients with SS and 47 healthy volunteers with similar demographic characteristics.
5397,605,"It was found that isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) and deceleration time (DT) were significantly longer and early diastolic wave (E) was significantly lower in patients with SS, but there was no difference in the other parameters."
5398,605,"When tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE) findings were compared between the two groups, it was found that myocardial systolic wave (Sm), myocardial early diastolic wave (Em) and Em/Am ratio were significantly lower, and myocardial isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRTm) and myocardial performance index (MPI) values were significantly higher in patients with SS."
5399,605,"A significant positive correlations between aortic strain and Sm (r=0.35, P<0.001), Em (r=0.42, P<0.001) and Em/Am (r=0.26, P=0.008) and negative correlations in IVRTm (r=-0.36, P<0.001) and MPI (r=-0.24, P=0.01) were detected."
5400,605,"A significant positive correlation between aortic distensibility and Sm (r=0.36, P<0.001), Em (r=0.44, P<0.001), Em/Am (r=0.26, P=0.009) and negative correlation of IVRTm (r=-0.22, P=0.02) were determined."
5401,605,CONCLUSION: There is a significant relationship between AS and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients with SS in this study.
5402,605,The parameters of aortic elasticity measured by 2D echocardiographic methods can be beneficial in predicting early cardiovascular risk in SS.
5403,606,"OBJECTIVE: In our current work, in vivo examination of AQP5 distribution in labial salivary glands following stimulation of secretion has been carried out in normal individuals and in patients with Sjgren's syndrome."
5404,606,"SUBJECTS AND METHODS: For this study, we selected five patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (mean age 62.4  10.6 s.d."
5405,606,years) diagnosed in accordance with the European Cooperative Community classification criteria.
5406,606,There were five patients (mean age 27  2.5 s.d.
5407,606,years) in the control group.
5408,606,The subcellular distribution of AQP5 in human labial gland biopsies was determined with light and immunoelectron microscopy before and 30 min after administration of oral pilocarpine.
5409,606,"RESULTS: In unstimulated control and Sjgren's labial glands, AQP5 is about 90% localized in the apical plasma membrane, with only rarely associated gold particles with intracellular membrane structures."
5410,606,We have found no evidence of pilocarpine-induced changes in localization of AQP5 in either healthy individuals or patients with Sjgren's syndrome.
5411,606,"CONCLUSIONS: Our studies indicate that neither Sjgren's syndrome itself, nor muscarinic cholinergic stimulation in vivo caused any significant changes in the distribution of AQP5 in the labial salivary gland cells."
5412,607,PURPOSE: To evaluate tear meniscus changes in patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS) receiving oral pilocarpine with Visante optical coherence tomography (OCT).
5413,607,METHODS: Eight patients with primary SS were recruited in this prospective interventional case series study.
5414,607,Patients received pilocarpine tablets twice a day for 3 months.
5415,607,Visual analog scale assessment for dry eye and dry mouth symptoms was carried out.
5416,607,"Patients underwent OCT and slit-lamp microscopy graticule scale tear meniscus height (TMH) measurements, strip meniscometry testing, tear film breakup time measurement, fluorescein and Rose Bengal staining, and the Schirmer 1 test."
5417,607,"The data were analyzed 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after treatment."
5418,607,Mann-Whitney test was performed.
5419,607,RESULTS: Visual analog scale assessment showed a significant time-wise improvement (P < 0.05).
5420,607,"OCT and graticule scale TMH measurements significantly improved after 1 week (P < 0.05), 1 month, and 3 months of treatment (P < 0.001)."
5421,607,"Strip meniscometry, mean tear film stability, and fluorescein and Rose Bengal scores remained improved 3 months after treatment (P < 0.001), whereas Schirmer 1 test values tended to improve without statistical significance."
5422,607,CONCLUSIONS: Visante OCT was effective in monitoring tear meniscus changes during the course of treatment noninvasively and quickly.
5423,607,"Oral pilocarpine seemed to be effective in improving TMH, and the signs and symptoms of dryness in patients with SS."
5424,608,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a prototypic autoimmune disorder, management of which has long suffered from a lack of knowledge of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms; however, over the past decade major advances have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of pSS."
5425,608,"The innate immune system has been demonstrated to have an important role at the early stage of the disease, notably through activation of the type I interferon (IFN) system."
5426,608,"In addition, mechanisms of B-cell activation in pSS have become clearer, particularly owing to recognition of the involvement of the TNF family cytokine B-cell-activating factor, production of which is highly dependent on expression of type I and type II IFNs."
5427,608,"Moreover, key inroads have been made in understanding lymphomagenesis, the most severe complication of pSS."
5428,608,"IL-12 production and subsequent T-cell activation, mainly IFN--secreting type 1 T-helper cells, have also been implicated in disease pathogenesis."
5429,608,"Furthermore, evidence implicates neuroendocrine system dysfunction in pSS pathogenesis."
5430,608,These pathophysiological advances open new avenues of investigation.
5431,608,"Indeed, the increased understanding of pSS pathogenesis has already led to the development of promising novel therapeutic strategies."
5432,608,This article summarizes recent findings regarding the pathogenic mechanisms involved in pSS and their implications.
5433,609,Sjogren's syndrome(SS) is defined as a slowly processing autoimmune inflammatory exocrinopathy affecting the salivary and lachrymal glands.
5434,609,"Due to the difficulty in reaching a diagnosis in some SS cases, there are many criteria published for classification and diagnosis."
5435,609,"Among the most of criteria, lip biopsy plays an important role in clinical diagnosis, but it is an invasive and complex method which always causes patients' pain and discomfort."
5436,609,Raman spectroscopy is a noninvasive and real-time vibrational spectroscopic technique applied in the clinical detection and diagnosis of diseases.
5437,609,The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity are both high.
5438,609,The hypothesis is to detect the minor salivary glands affected in SS by the noninvasive Raman spectroscopy instead of lip biopsy.
5439,609,"Therefore, Raman spectroscopy may increase the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, meanwhile prevent patients from pain caused by biopsy."
5440,610,OBJECTIVE: To study pregnancy and fetal outcome in women with primary SS (pSS) compared with women in the general population.
5441,610,"METHODS: In a nested case-control setting, variables related to pregnancy and fetal outcomes were compared."
5442,610,Cases (n = 16) were identified through registry linkage (Malm pSS registry and a database entailing information of all pregnancies and deliveries in Malm from 1990 through 2006).
5443,610,"For each pregnancy with pSS, the following five deliveries from the same registry were chosen as controls (n = 80)."
5444,610,RESULTS: All cases fulfilled the American European Consensus Criteria for pSS and were positive for ANA and anti-SSA antibodies.
5445,610,Date of diagnosis was before pregnancy in 10 women and after delivery in 6.
5446,610,Mean age at delivery was significantly higher in women with pSS (33.6 years) vs controls (29.8 years).
5447,610,"While pregnancy duration did not differ, mean birthweight was significantly lower in offspring of pSS mothers (3010 g) vs babies of control mothers (3458 g)."
5448,610,Normal partus in contrast to vacuum extraction or Caesarean section was significantly more frequent in healthy women than in pSS women (83 vs 56%).
5449,610,"Other pregnancy outcomes such as parity, miscarriages and Apgar score did not differ."
5450,610,There were no significant differences between women with a pSS diagnosis before or after the index pregnancy.
5451,610,Only one of the included pregnancies was complicated by intrauterine AV block.
5452,610,CONCLUSION: Pregnancy occurs later in life in pSS women.
5453,610,Mothers with pSS give birth to offspring with lower birthweight and less commonly have normal partus.
5454,611,"RATIONALE: Sjogren's syndrome(SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease, which damages exocrine glands especially salivary and lacrimal glands, with xerostomia and xerophthalmia as common symptoms."
5455,611,PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a case of a 49-year-old woman presented with pancytopenia.
5456,611,Her laboratory examinations lead us diagnose her as Sjogren's syndrome complicating pancytopenia.
5457,611,"She had neurological symptoms during her treatment, which represent only 4.5% of Sjogren's syndrome complicating damage in nervous system."
5458,611,DIAGNOSES: Sjogren's syndrome complicating pancytopenia.
5459,611,INTERVENTIONS: Dexamethasone (40mg QD for 4 days) and immunoglobulin (25g QD for 2 days) were administered for intensive treatment followed by oral methylprednisolone 40mg QD as maintenance treatment.
5460,611,Total glucosides of paeony 0.6g TID and danazol 0.2g BID per os were given.
5461,611,"We also gave her Piperacillin-tazobactam and moxifloxacin for anti-infection and Fluconazole for anti-fungal therapy, as well as other supportive treatments."
5462,611,"OUTCOMES: Follow-up of the patient observed the normalization of peripheral blood cell count, immunity indices and neurological examinations 6 months after discharge."
5463,611,"LESSONS: For patients presented with blood system abnormalities unilineage or multiple-lineage cytopenia in particular, history investigations and relevant examinations should be considered to exclude the existence of autoimmune diseases like Sjogren's syndrome."
5464,612,OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of sialendoscopy of the major salivary glands on salivary flow and xerostomia in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
5465,612,METHODS: Forty-nine patients with SS were randomly assigned to a control group (n=15) and two intervention groups: irrigation of the major glands with saline (n=16) or with saline followed by triamcinolone acetonide (TA) in saline (n=18).
5466,612,"Unstimulated whole saliva flow (UWS), chewing-stimulated whole saliva flow (SWS), citric acid-stimulated parotid flow (SPF), Clinical Oral Dryness Score (CODS), Xerostomia Inventory (XI) score and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) SS Patient-Reported Index (ESSPRI) were obtained 1week (T0) before, and 1 (T1), 8 (T8), 16 (T16) and 24 (T24) weeks after sialendoscopy."
5467,612,"RESULTS: Median baseline UWS, SWS and SPF scores were 0.14, 0.46 and 0.22mL/min, respectively."
5468,612,"After intervention, significant increases in UWS and SWS were observed in the saline group (at T8 (P=0.013) and T24 (P=0.004)) and the saline/TA group (at T24 (P=0.03) and T=16 (P=0.035))."
5469,612,SPF was increased significantly in the saline/TA group at T24 (P=0.03).
5470,612,XI scores declined after sialendoscopy in both intervention groups.
5471,612,"Compared with the control group, CODS, XI and ESSPRI improved in the intervention groups."
5472,612,"UWS, SWS and SPF were higher in the intervention groups compared with the control group, but these differences were not significant except for SPF in the saline/TA group at T24 (P=0.005)."
5473,612,CONCLUSIONS: Irrigation of the major salivary glands in patients with SS enhances salivary flow and reduces xerostomia up to 6 months after sialendoscopy.
5474,613,"INTRODUCTION: The introduction of new classification criteria for Sjgren's syndrome, known as the 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism Classification Criteria (ACR-EULAR), created a need for the evaluation of its performance in an external cohort."
5475,613,"The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the 2016 ACR-EULAR classification set with the widely used American-European Consensus Group Classification criteria (AECG) in the cohort at the National Institutes of Health, USA, and to compare the performance of the sets in classifying both primary and secondary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS and sSS)."
5476,613,"METHODS: The study cohort at the NIH (N=1,303) was enrolled for clinical suspicion of SS."
5477,613,"Participants were classified as SS, pSS, and sSS according to both classification sets."
5478,613,Performance of 2016 ACR-EULAR and AECG sets was compared holding each as gold standard to the other.
5479,613,Statistical analysis of test diagnostics and agreement between the two sets were undertaken.
5480,613,"RESULTS: By the AECG set, 701 were classified as having SS (627 pSS, 74 sSS) and 714 were classified with SS (647 pSS, 67 sSS) by the 2016 ACR-EULAR set."
5481,613,"Sensitivity and specificity of the two sets were comparable in classifying SS, pSS, and sSS."
5482,613,"There was high agreement between the two sets for classifying SS (=0.79), pSS (=0.81), and sSS (=0.87)."
5483,613,"The specificity of the 2016 ACR-EULAR set was significantly higher for classifying sSS than pSS, while the sensitivity was similar for the two disease groups."
5484,613,"However, this pattern was also exhibited by the AECG set."
5485,613,CONCLUSION: There was high agreement between the two classification sets with comparable performance diagnostics.
5486,613,"There was no evidence of superior performance value by the new 2016 ACR-EULAR set over the AECG set, and the two sets were found to be equivalent."
5487,613,Findings from our cohort indicate that 2016 ACR-EULAR classification could be extended to classification of sSS.
5488,614,The role of CD28- T cell subpopulations in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) has become controversial.
5489,614,Changes in the number of CD28- T cells have been demonstrated in autoimmune diseases in co-existence with Sjgren's syndrome.
5490,614,The study aimed to indicate differences in the number of CD4+CD28- and CD8+CD28- T cells in patients with sicca syndrome and suspected pSS.
5491,614,Thirty patients with sicca syndrome at baseline were studied and followed up for 5 months.
5492,614,"After final diagnosis, comparison was made of the previously recorded lymphocyte subpopulations in patients with pSS and those in other defined subgroups."
5493,614,"Notably high percentages of CD8+CD28- T cells were indicated in pSS patients, which correlated with the severity of the sicca symptoms and cutaneous and muscular systemic disease activity."
5494,614,Changes in CD8+CD28- T cell percentages may thus assist in the early differential diagnosis of pSS patients from those with similar clinical symptoms.
5495,615,OBJECTIVE: Painful small-fiber neuropathies (SFNs) in primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) may present as pure or mixed with concurrent large-fiber involvement.
5496,615,SFN can be diagnosed by punch skin biopsy results that identify decreased intra-epidermal nerve-fiber density (IENFD) of unmyelinated nerves.
5497,615,METHODS: We compared 23 consecutively evaluated patients with SS with pure and mixed SFN versus 98 patients without SFN.
5498,615,We distinguished between markers of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) degeneration (decreased IENFD in the proximal thigh versus the distal leg) versus axonal degeneration (decreased IENFD in the distal leg versus the proximal thigh).
5499,615,"RESULTS: There were no differences in pain intensity, pain quality, and treatment characteristics in the comparison of 13 patients with pure SFN versus 10 patients with mixed SFN."
5500,615,Ten patients with SFN (approximately 45%) had neuropathic pain preceding sicca symptoms.
5501,615,Opioid analgesics were prescribed to approximately 45% of patients with SFN.
5502,615,"When compared to 98 patients without SFN, the 23 patients with SFN had an increased frequency of male sex (30% versus 9%; P < 0.01), a decreased frequency of anti-Ro 52 (P = 0.01) and anti-Ro 60 antibodies (P = 0.01), rheumatoid factor positivity (P < 0.01), and polyclonal gammopathy (P < 0.01)."
5503,615,"Eleven patients had stocking-and-glove pain, and 12 patients had nonstocking-and-glove pain."
5504,615,Skin biopsy results disclosed patterns of axonal (16 patients) and DRG injury (7 patients).
5505,615,"CONCLUSION: SS SFN had an increased frequency among male patients, a decreased frequency of multiple antibodies, frequent treatment with opioid analgesics, and the presence of nonstocking-and-glove pain."
5506,615,"Distinguishing between DRG versus axonal injury is significant, especially given that mechanisms targeting the DRG may result in irreversible neuronal cell death."
5507,615,"Altogether, these findings highlight clinical, autoantibody, and pathologic features that can help to define mechanisms and treatment strategies."
5508,616,BACKGROUND/AIM: Many autoimmune diseases occur concomitantly with celiac disease (CD).
5509,616,We aimed to determine the frequency of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in CD patients based on SS-specific serology verified by minor labial salivary biopsy.
5510,616,MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight-two patients with CD were included in the study.
5511,616,"After examination for objective evidence of sicca complex, all patients were tested for serological presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and for ANA profile."
5512,616,Minor labial salivary biopsy was performed for patients with positive serology and/or clinical signs of SS.
5513,616,"RESULTS: Of the patients included, 24 (29.3%) had dry eye symptoms while 20 (24.4%) had dry mouth symptoms."
5514,616,Dry eye was detected by Schirmer test in 10 patients (12.2%) and by ocular staining score in only 2 patients (2.4%).
5515,616,All samples were negative for RF while 12 (14.6%) samples were positive for ANAs.
5516,616,"Of 82 patients with CD, the diagnosis of SS was established in only one patient (1.2%), while one patient (1.2%) was diagnosed with morphea and 4 patients (4.9%) were classified as having undifferentiated connective tissue disease."
5517,616,"CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SS in CD is low, so there is no need for serologic screening of all patients with CD for SS."
5518,617,The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of Oral Balance saliva substitute in alleviating dry mouth symptoms in a sample of patients with secondary Sjgren's syndrome.
5519,617,Twenty-one consecutive secondary Sjgren's syndrome patients with dry mouth complaints and hyposalivation were included in this study.
5520,617,Patients used a lactoperoxidase-system-containing gel (Biotne Oral Balance) for 4 weeks.
5521,617,"The effects on subjective oral symptoms were recorded by means of a 7-items questionnaire which contained questions regarding dry mouth sensation and its effect on chewing, swallowing, taste, speech, burning sensation and denture retention."
5522,617,The severity of symptoms was assessed using a visual analogical scale.
5523,617,Oral symptom scores and unstimulated whole salivary flow were recorded at baseline and after 4 weeks' use of the product.
5524,617,"Two patients withdrew from the study, because of nausea and unpleasant taste caused by the product."
5525,617,"Nineteen patients (all women, mean age 52.7 years) participated throughout the entire study."
5526,617,"Wilcoxon signed-ranked tests indicated significant improvements in visual analogical scale scores posttreatment for 5 of the 7 items on the oral dryness questionnaire, although no increase in salivary flow was found."
5527,617,"However, the improvement in certain variables did not take a positive course in all cases."
5528,617,Patients with lower salivary flow at baseline tended to have greater improvement in oral symptoms.
5529,617,"The study suggests that the use of Oral Balance gel is effective in alleviating the dry mouth symptoms in secondary Sjgren's syndrome patients, but a randomized controlled trial is needed to assess the placebo effect."
5530,618,OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to develop clinical practice guideline (CPG) for Sjgren's syndrome (SS) based on recently available clinical and therapeutic evidences.
5531,618,"METHODS: The CPG committee for SS was organized by the Research Team for Autoimmune Diseases, Research Program for Intractable Disease of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW), Japan."
5532,618,The committee completed a systematic review of evidences for several clinical questions and developed CPG for SS 2017 according to the procedure proposed by the Medical Information Network Distribution Service (Minds).
5533,618,The recommendations and their strength were checked by the modified Delphi method.
5534,618,The CPG for SS 2017 has been officially approved by both Japan College of Rheumatology and the Japanese Society for SS.
5535,618,"RESULTS: The CPG committee set 38 clinical questions for clinical symptoms, signs, treatment, and management of SS in pediatric, adult and pregnant patients, using the PICO (P: patients, problem, population, I: interventions, C: comparisons, controls, comparators, O: outcomes) format."
5536,618,"A summary of evidence, development of recommendation, recommendation, and strength for these 38 clinical questions are presented in the CPG."
5537,618,CONCLUSION: The CPG for SS 2017 should contribute to improvement and standardization of diagnosis and treatment of SS.
5538,619,"Parotitis is a common condition seen in the pediatric population, usually as an isolated occurrence associated with viral or bacterial infection."
5539,619,The differential diagnosis expands when recurrent parotitis is encountered.
5540,619,"One etiology is primary pediatric Sjgren syndrome (SS), an autoimmune condition typically associated with dryness of the eyes and mouth in adults."
5541,619,"Pediatric patients often present with isolated recurrent bilateral parotitis, however, and we describe 4 such cases in children aged 9 to 17 years at presentation."
5542,619,"Despite lack of ocular complaints, 3 of these patients had ocular findings on ophthalmologic exam."
5543,619,"Our patients also exhibited classic laboratory abnormalities, including positive antinuclear antibody, SS A, and SS B antibodies; presence of rheumatoid factor; and hypergammaglobulinemia."
5544,619,Consideration of SS in the child with recurrent parotitis is important for timely and appropriate referral and treatment.
5545,619,We review the differential diagnosis of parotitis in children as well as the salient features of pediatric SS.
5546,620,INTRODUCTION: Neurological manifestations in Sjgren's syndrome are variable.
5547,620,The peripheral nervous system is generally involved.
5548,620,We report a rare case of an unusual central neurological manifestation.
5549,620,CASE REPORT: A 54-year-old woman was admitted with headache and tetraparesia.
5550,620,The physical examination revealed a tetrapyramidal syndrome and a bilateral parotidomegaly.
5551,620,The patient's general condition was nevertheless quite good.
5552,620,Brain MRI showed an heterogeneous pontine lesion with multiple nodular formations in the periventricular white matter.
5553,620,Blood tests revealed anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies.
5554,620,A labial salivary gland biopsy was grade IV in Chisholm scoring system and Schirmer's test was positive.
5555,620,CONCLUSION: A latent Sjgren's syndrome can lead to a wide variety of focal brain MRI abnormalities and should be evoked when the etiology is not clear.
5556,621,Dystrophic calcinosis in soft tissue occurs in damaged or devitalized tissues in the presence of normal calcium and phosphorous metabolism.
5557,621,It is often noted in subcutaneous tissues in patients with collagen vascular diseases and may involve a relatively localized area or be widespread.
5558,621,"A 74-year-old Japanese woman with an overlap of rheumatoid arthritis, Sjgren's syndrome, and systemic sclerosis developed a huge tumor-like mass at the atlanto-axial vertebral joint region that caused severe cervical pain and difficulty in activities of daily living."
5559,621,She also had subcutaneous dystrophic calcification in the soft tissue of the chest wall.
5560,621,"Calcinosis associated with systemic sclerosis is a well-recognized phenomenon, but a destructive paraspinal tumor in the cervical spine associated with overlap syndrome is extremely unique."
5561,621,"Because calcinosis in spinal locations can be complicated by neurological involvement, patients with progressive symptoms may require surgical intervention."
5562,621,Surgical resection and biological therapy improved this patient's life and activities of daily living.
5563,621,"Calcinosis is common in the conditions reviewed here, and different agents have been used for treatment."
5564,621,"However, calcinosis management is poorly organized and lacks an accepted classification, systematic studies, and clinical therapeutic trials."
5565,621,The association of calcinosis and collagen vascular diseases is clinically and etiologically important.
5566,621,"Although a combination of calcinosis and rheumatoid overlap syndrome is rare, various collagen vascular diseases may occur simultaneously."
5567,621,"A perceptive diagnostic approach toward these diseases is critical, and early diagnosis and treatment are needed to prevent dystrophic calcinosis."
5568,622,Biopsies of apparently healthy skin can contribute to the diagnosis of an internal disorder in a patient or in the detection of a potential disease carrier.
5569,622,"Herein, we review those diseases for which dermatologists may be asked to perform a biopsy on normal skin where analysis by optical microscopy, immunofluorescence or electronic microscopy may result in diagnosis of an ""internal"" disease."
5570,622,Diseases for which biopsies are required for cell cultures (e.g.
5571,622,"fibroblasts cultures), clonality testing or chromosomal analysis are not discussed here."
5572,623,The autoimmune exocrinopathy Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is characterized by mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltrates of exocrine glands and overactivity of B lymphocytes.
5573,623,"Although T cells have long been perceived as the prime effectors, increasing evidence indicates that the key role is rather served by B cells."
5574,623,"Among related abnormalities are rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-SSA/Ro, and anti-SSB/La antibodies (Ab)."
5575,623,"Also, supporting this view is our finding of an increase in the number of circulating nave mature B (Bm) cells, with a reciprocal decrease in that of memory B cells."
5576,623,"Furthermore, a ratio of Bm2-plus-Bm2' cells to early Bm5-plus-late Bm5 above 5 is diagnostic."
5577,623,"This variation partly reflects the migration of active memory B cells into the exocrine glands of the patients, as well as into their skin."
5578,623,"More recently, the B-cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF) has been endorsed with a pivotal role in B-cell survival and hence implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity."
5579,623,"In practice, B cells have turned quite attractive as a target for biotherapy."
5580,623,"For example, treatment with anti-CD20 Ab has afforded some benefits in this disease, while BAFF blockers are still on the way, but should expand our armamentarium for treating SS."
5581,623,"With such B-cell-directed biotherapies in mind, we delineate herein the distinguishing traits of B lymphocytes in SS."
5582,624,Ro52 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase with a prominent regulatory role in inflammation.
5583,624,"The protein is a common target of circulating autoantibodies in rheumatic autoimmune diseases, particularly Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
5584,624,In this study we aimed to investigate the expression of the SS target autoantigen Ro52 in salivary glands of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
5585,624,"Ro52 expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded and frozen salivary gland biopsies from 28 pSS patients and 19 non-pSS controls from Swedish and Norwegian registries, using anti-human Ro52 monoclonal antibodies."
5586,624,The degree and pattern of staining and inflammation was then evaluated.
5587,624,"Furthermore, secreted Ro52 protein was measured in saliva and serum samples from the same individuals through a catch-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)."
5588,624,Ro52 was highly expressed in all the focal infiltrates in pSS patients.
5589,624,"Interestingly, a significantly higher degree of Ro52 expression in ductal epithelium was observed in the patients compared to the non-pSS controls (P<003)."
5590,624,"Moreover, the degree of ductal epithelial expression of Ro52 correlated with the level of inflammation (Spearman's r=048, P<00120)."
5591,624,"However, no secreted Ro52 protein could be detected in serum and saliva samples of these subjects."
5592,624,Ro52 expression in ductal epithelium coincides with degree of inflammation and is up-regulated in pSS patients.
5593,624,High expression of Ro52 might result in the breakage of tolerance and generation of Ro52 autoantibodies in genetically susceptible individuals.
5594,624,We conclude that the up-regulation of Ro52 in ductal epithelium might be a triggering factor for disease progression in SS.
5595,625,OBJECTIVE: To assess the correlation between conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR sialography of parotid glands with salivary gland scintigraphy in patients with Sjgren's syndrome.
5596,625,METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on eight patients with Sjgren's syndrome who underwent MR imaging and salivary gland scintigraphy.
5597,625,"Conventional MR imaging techniques, such as T1-weighted images (T1WI), T2-weighted images (T2WI), and short TI inversion recovery images (STIR) were used for changes of fat signal in the parotid gland, while the MR sialography were used for ducts dilation of the parotid gland."
5598,625,"Regarding scintigraphy, time-activity curves of each parotid gland were analysed."
5599,625,The salivary gland excretion fraction was defined as A (before stimulation test (counts/20 s)) and B (after stimulation test (counts/20 s)).
5600,625,"RESULTS: Regarding characteristic appearances of fat signal, the A/B of parotid gland with homogeneous intensity distribution (3.51  0.75) was higher than that with heterogeneous intensity distribution (1.56  0.66, P = 0.001)."
5601,625,"Regarding MR sialographic stages, the A/B of parotid gland with stage 0 (3.51  0.75) was higher than that with stage 1 (2.03  0.86, P = 0.009) and with stage 2 (1.26  0.25, P = 0.000)."
5602,625,CONCLUSION: The results suggest that MR sialography of the parotid glands is a useful noninvasive tool for evaluating the decrease of salivary gland excretion in patients with Sjgren's syndrome.
5603,626,"Patients with a suspected connective tissue disorder should undergo serologic testing to confirm the diagnosis and, in some cases, to monitor disease activity and predict flares."
5604,626,Patients with suspected systemic lupus erythematosus should be tested for antinuclear antibodies.
5605,626,"However, antinuclear antibodies are not specific and may be present in many other connective tissue disorders and nonrheumatologic diseases."
5606,626,"Thus, patients with suspected systemic lupus erythematosus should undergo further testing to confirm the diagnosis."
5607,626,"Patients with Sjgren syndrome may have a positive antinuclear antibody titer, but often also have positive anti-Sjgren antigen A or B results."
5608,626,"Similarly, antinuclear antibodies can be present in patients with scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease, and dermatomyositis or polymyositis."
5609,626,Additional tests are needed to help confirm the diagnosis.
5610,626,"In patients with findings of rheumatoid arthritis, a positive rheumatoid factor titer suggests the diagnosis, but as with antinuclear antibodies, it is not specific and can occur in other conditions."
5611,626,Rheumatoid factor can also be negative in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
5612,626,A positive anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody titer is more specific for rheumatoid arthritis and can help confirm the diagnosis.
5613,626,Physicians should order these serologic tests only when patients have a high pretest probability of a specific connective tissue disorder.
5614,627,A pilot study was performed to examine the presence of nerve fibres in minor salivary gland tissue samples obtained by two procedures: punch and linear incisional techniques.
5615,627,The study was undertaken on a convenience sample of five cryopreserved corpses (mean age 74  3.5 years; three males and two females).
5616,627,"Biopsies were performed on the buccal side of the lower lip, between the mid-line and the corner of the mouth."
5617,627,Each corpse had one side of the lower lip biopsied by punch and the contralateral side using a linear incision.
5618,627,"All punch samples (100%) displayed severed nerve fibres, whereas no nerve fibres (0%) could be identified in the samples obtained by means of the linear incision technique."
5619,627,"While the linear incision approach permitted retrieval of at least five glands, punch biopsies did not provide enough material for the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome."
5620,627,"Within the limitations of the study, our results strongly discourage the punch technique for minor salivary gland lip biopsy and provide information on the superiority of the linear incisional biopsy in terms of neural damage."
5621,627,"These results may also promote the undertaking of clinical trials on patients in whom Sjgren's syndrome is suspected, comparing the morbidity associated with the linear incisional technique vs. minimally invasive biopsies."
5622,628,OBJECTIVE: The Sjgren's Syndrome Foundation clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are designed to improve quality and consistency of care in Sjgren's syndrome by offering recommendations for management.
5623,628,METHODS: Management questions for the systemic manifestations of Sjgren's syndrome were posed by the CPG committee with input from patients and rheumatologists.
5624,628,Clinical questions were assigned to a topic review group that performed systematic reviews and data extraction and drafted guidelines.
5625,628,"Quality of evidence and strength of recommendation were rated using the American Society of Clinical Oncology's modification of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation."
5626,628,"Guideline recommendations were reviewed by a consensus expert panel (CEP) composed of 30-40 clinicians from academia and community practices, as well as registered nurses and patients, using a modified Delphi process."
5627,628,A CEP agreement level of 75% was set as a minimum for adoption of a guideline recommendation.
5628,628,"RESULTS: Consensus was achieved for 19 recommendations; for 11 additional modules, available data were insufficient to allow a recommendation to be formulated."
5629,628,"Of the 19 recommendations, 15 required 1 Delphi round, 2 required 2 rounds, and 2 required 3 rounds."
5630,628,"CONCLUSION: Key recommendations include a decision tree for the use of oral disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for inflammatory musculoskeletal pain, use of self-care measures and advice regarding exercise to reduce fatigue, and the use of rituximab in selected clinical settings for oral and ocular dryness and for certain extraglandular manifestations, including vasculitis, severe parotid swelling, inflammatory arthritis, pulmonary disease, and mononeuritis multiplex."
5631,628,The CPG committee strongly discouraged the use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors for sicca symptoms and for the majority of clinical contexts in primary Sjgren's syndrome.
5632,629,OBJECTIVES: To analyse the initial presentation and outcome of children with a diagnosis of childhood-onset Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in a paediatric referral care center.
5633,629,To study whether the diagnosis was made in accordance with the most recent criteria of paediatric SS and to compare our patients to those reported in the literature.
5634,629,"METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the clinical, histological and laboratory features of patients seen over a period of 15 years and diagnosed with SS before the age of 16."
5635,629,RESULTS: Eight patients had a diagnosis of SS in childhood and were followed for up to 14 years.
5636,629,Diagnosis of SS was based on histological evidence of salivary gland involvement in all patients with or without presence of specific autoantibodies (anti-SSA and -SSB).
5637,629,"Sicca syndrome as a presenting symptom occurred in only 2/8 of children, recurrent parotid swelling in 3/8; whereas anti-SSA/SSB antibodies and typical salivary-gland histology were found in 6/8 patients."
5638,629,Five children fulfilled the proposed paediatric criteria for SS.
5639,629,Three patients did not fulfill the paediatric criteria but disclosed typical histology findings.
5640,629,Two patients developed overlapping lupus nephritis or autoimmune hepatitis years following diagnosis of SS.
5641,629,CONCLUSIONS: Childhood-onset SS is an heterogeneous disease in its presentation and outcome.
5642,629,"The diagnosis may be discussed in some patients who do not fulfill the proposed diagnosis criteria, even though they disclose sicca syndrome and typical immunologic and histological findings."
5643,629,Some patients with typical SS may develop overlapping lupus disease over time.
5644,630,OBJECTIVES: Endogenous cognitive event-related potentials (CERPs) reflect higher-level processing of sensory information and can be used to evaluate cognitive functions.
5645,630,The aim of this paper was to determine whether there are any abnormalities in the electrophysiological parameters of CERPs in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) but without symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) involvement or mental disorder.
5646,630,The analysis of CERP parameters was then correlated with the clinical status of the patients and with some of the immunological parameters in the patient group.
5647,630,"METHOD: Thirty consecutive patients with pSS (29 females, one male) were included in the study."
5648,630,All the patients underwent CERP examination.
5649,630,RESULTS: There was a significant prolongation of the latency of P300 and N200 potentials in patients with pSS.
5650,630,"Abnormalities in electrophysiological parameters of CERPs correlated with the duration of the disease, salivary gland abnormalities, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values."
5651,630,Patients with coexisting chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) had larger P300 amplitudes.
5652,630,"There were no statistically significant changes in the electrophysiological parameters of CERPs in patients with pSS dependent on the presence of peripheral nervous system (PNS) lesions, skin changes, arthritis, abnormalities in white blood cells and the immune system or the levels of blood lipids."
5653,630,CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study suggest the presence of a minor cognitive dysfunction in patients with pSS without symptoms of CNS involvement or mental disorder.
5654,630,Cognitive dysfunction correlated with the disease duration time and the severity of inflammatory changes (salivary gland abnormalities and inflammatory markers in the blood).
5655,630,Further and larger longitudinal studies are necessary for confirmation of this correlation.
5656,631,"AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients."
5657,631,"METHODS: The present study consisted of 79 individuals with various rheumatic disease (study group: 39 with RA, 17 with AS, 23 with pSS) and 79 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (control group)."
5658,631,Subjective symptoms of the TMJ were recorded by means of a questionnaire.
5659,631,And stomatognathic examination was then performed.
5660,631,RESULTS: The prevalence of subjective symptoms in patients with rheumatic disease (73.4%) were significantly higher than that of the controls (22.8%; P<.05).
5661,631,"The most common objective symptoms were pain during lateral TMJ palpation (29.1% of patients overall, 8.9% of controls) and mandibular movements (19% of patients overall, 2.5% of controls), and muscle pain during palpation (38% of patients overall, 3.8% of controls)."
5662,631,They were significantly higher in all of the rheumatic patients than the controls (P<.05).
5663,631,"There was not a statistically-significant difference in the values for mandibular movements between the study and control groups (P>.05, Mann-Whitney U test)."
5664,631,"CONCLUSIONS: TMJ symptoms were observed to be higher in the patients with RA, AS and pSS than the control group."
5665,631,Dentists and rheumatologists should be aware of TMJ symptoms in patients with rheumatic diseases.
5666,632,OBJECTIVES: To investigate serum levels of endostatin in a well characterised cohort of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and healthy controls (HC) and assess associations between these mediators and clinical parameters.
5667,632,METHODS: All patients (n=144) were recruited from the Norwegian systemic connective tissue disease and vasculitis registry (NOSVAR) and fulfilled American-European classification criteria for pSS.
5668,632,Pulmonary involvement was based on clinical symptoms and abnormal findings on high-resolution computed tomography of the lungs.
5669,632,The controls were 100 healthy blood donors.
5670,632,Serum levels of endostatin was determined by enzyme immunoassay.
5671,632,RESULTS: We found higher mean levels of serum endostatin in patients with pSS compared with the controls (p<0.001).
5672,632,The patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) had higher levels compared with those without pulmonary involvement.
5673,632,CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that endostatin is increased in patients with pSS and particularly in those with ILD.
5674,633,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the subclinical articular involvement in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) using musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS), and to correlate the findings with laboratory results and clinical manifestations."
5675,633,METHODS: Forty-eight consecutive patients with pSS were enrolled.
5676,633,"The bilateral metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and interphalangeal joints were examined using MSUS, and the synovial hypertrophy and power Doppler signal were recorded for each joint using semi-quantitative scores (0 = normal, 1 = mild change compared with undamaged joint, 2 = moderate change, and 3 = severe change)."
5677,633,"RESULTS: Mild or moderate synovial hypertrophy was found in 151 (15.7%) and 2 (0.2%) out of 960 hand joints, respectively, and power Doppler signals were present in 19 (2.0%) of the 960 joints."
5678,633,"While anti-centromere antibody (ACA) was found in 10 patients (20.8%), none of the patients with MSUS-confirmed synovitis was positive for ACA."
5679,633,"No other autoantibodies, laboratory tests, or clinical manifestations correlated with MSUS-confirmed synovitis."
5680,633,CONCLUSION: MSUS is useful for detecting subclinical synovitis in pSS patients.
5681,633,MSUS showed that ACA-positive pSS patients had a low prevalence of synovitis.
5682,634,"Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is rare in the pediatric population, but primary Sjogren syndrome is a well-established risk factor for this malignancy."
5683,634,This report describes 2 cases of MALT lymphoma in children with Sjogren syndrome.
5684,634,A 15-year-old girl developed MALT lymphoma of the parotid gland as the presenting symptom of Sjogren syndrome.
5685,634,"In the second case, a 15-year-old boy with known Sjogren syndrome presenting mainly with arthritis was diagnosed with MALT lymphoma, also of the parotid gland."
5686,634,"With early diagnosis and treatment, outcomes in pediatric MALT lymphoma are generally encouraging."
5687,634,Pediatric oncology specialists should be aware of the association of MALT lymphoma with Sjogren syndrome and have a high index of suspicion for this malignant complication.
5688,635,"This case report describes a 52-year-old, female applicant for long term-care insurance with a history of an autoimmune connective tissue disease initially diagnosed as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)."
5689,635,"Over several years, the signs and symptoms evolved into a clear diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS)."
5690,635,"The specific criteria for this diagnosis are reviewed including the symptoms, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (ENA), abnormal salivary scintigraphy and positive Schirmer test."
5691,635,Symptoms of neuropathy and the possibility of a cognitive dysfunction are discussed as part of PSS.
5692,635,The association of white matter lesions (WML) with PSS is significant for underwriting consideration.
5693,636,A 49-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with gradually progressive weakness of the limbs for about 20 days.
5694,636,"She presented with weakness of the limbs, predominantly in the proximal portion, and slight dysesthesia of the limbs, predominantly in the distal portion."
5695,636,Repeated nerve conduction examination revealed axonopathy dominantly in the motor neurons.
5696,636,"Therefore, we suspected her as having Guillain-Barr syndrome, and initiated intravenous administration of high-dose immunoglobulin."
5697,636,"However, her symptoms progressed gradually and finally she found it difficult to walk."
5698,636,"Her urine analysis simultaneously demonstrated albuminuria, and a kidney biopsy indicated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis."
5699,636,"At that point, laboratory examination showed high levels of anti SS-A antibody and salivary gland biopsy revealed infiltration of a significant number of lymphocytes around the gland, which led to the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome."
5700,636,We considered the etiology of the neural and renal dysfunction as due to the inflammatory mechanism associated with Sjgren's syndrome.
5701,636,"Therefore, we administered a second course of immunoglobulin therapy and steroid therapy, which included both pulse and oral administration."
5702,636,Her neurologic symptoms and albuminuria improved rapidly after steroid therapy.
5703,636,The present case indicates that both motor dominant neuropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis can occur in patients with Sjgren's syndrome.
5704,637,"The patient was a 64-year-old woman with a nearly 20-year history of sicca symptoms, having been given a diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome."
5705,637,"Three years previously, she experienced difficulty in walking up a slope and had leg malaise, which insidiously progressed to an inability to go up and down stairs."
5706,637,"This disability brought her to our hospital, where her muscle strength was examined by manual muscle testing, and she was found to have reduced muscle strength in proximal muscles like the thigh muscles and the neck flexor muscles."
5707,637,"Blood studies revealed elevated ESR, increased serum IgG, mildly increased myogenic enzymes, and positive results for anti-SS-A and -SS-B antibodies."
5708,637,MRI scans disclosed extensive muscle atrophy as well as fatty degeneration in the thigh.
5709,637,"A biopsy of the quadriceps femoris muscle provided a diagnosis of myositis based on the finding of muscle fibers of unequal size, nuclear centralization, and inflammatory cell infiltration into muscle fibers."
5710,637,CD4-positive lymphocytes were the predominant inflammatory cells.
5711,637,We diagnosed the case as myositis in primary Sjgren's syndrome based on the clinical course and laboratory findings.
5712,637,She recovered well with steroid medication.
5713,637,It is noteworthy that myositis associated with primary Sjgren's syndrome presents with mild symptoms and unremarkable laboratory data but may run a chronic progressive course.
5714,638,"Although primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a mild indolent chronic disease mainly characterized by mucosal dryness in the majority of cases, a consistent subgroup of patients display extra-glandular manifestations."
5715,638,"Virtually any organs and systems can be affected, leading to a more serious disease prognosis."
5716,638,"Therefore, the prompt identification of patients at higher risk of extra-glandular manifestations is necessary to start a thorough follow up and an aggressive treatment."
5717,638,"The aim of this review article is to provide an overview of epidemiological, clinical and serological features of extra-glandular manifestations in pSS as well as current knowledge about putative biomarkers useful in clinical practice."
5718,639,PURPOSE: To evaluate the lacrimal gland function in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) using lacrimal scintigraphy (LS) and to determine the relationship between clinicopathological stage of primary SS and LS findings.
5719,639,METHODS: Seventy eyes from 35 patients with primary SS and 20 eyes from 10 healthy age-matched and sex-matched individuals who served as the control group were included in this study.
5720,639,The patients with primary SS were divided into two groups - early stage and advanced stage - according to the labial biopsy scores (23 patients in early stage and 12 in advanced stage).
5721,639,"LS, the Schirmer-1 test, determination of break-up time (BUT), Rose bengal ocular surface vital staining and assessment of functional parameters including ocular surface disease index (OSDI) scores were performed for all cases."
5722,639,LS was used to evaluate tear clearance.
5723,639,Lacrimal scintigrams were evaluated for the presence and severity of delayed tear clearance.
5724,639,"Delay in clearance was also subclassified according to the severity of delay (mild, moderate, severe and very severe)."
5725,639,LS findings and ophthalmological test results of patients in early stage of disease were compared with the results of those in advanced stage and with those of normal individuals.
5726,639,"RESULT: The Schirmer-1 test and BUT values of patients in advanced stage of primary SS decreased significantly, whereas the Rose bengal and OSDI values increased significantly when compared with the values of patients in early stage of primary SS and with those of normal individuals (P<0.05 and P<0.001, respectively)."
5727,639,"Tear clearance of patients in advanced-stage disease was delayed significantly, compared with the tear delay in patients in early stage of disease and that of normal individuals (P<0.001)."
5728,639,An inverse correlation existed between tear clearance and both the Schirmer-1 test and BUT value in all patients (P<0.001).
5729,639,"However, there was a positive correlation between both the Rose bengal ocular surface staining values and OSDI scores and tear clearance in all cases (P<0.001)."
5730,639,LS findings and ophthalmologic test results were significantly different between early-stage and advanced-stage primary SS.
5731,639,"CONCLUSION: The results indicate that LS, which is correlated closely with ophthalmological test results, may be a useful method for the assessment of the lacrimal gland function in patients with primary SS."
5732,639,LS findings and ophthalmological tests may be used for determining disease severity in primary SS.
5733,640,The number of patients with juvenile-onset Sjgren's syndrome (SS) has recently increased.
5734,640,"However, there is no drug that is safe and effective for the xerostomia that occurs in patients of this age group."
5735,640,We evaluated the efficacy and safety of orally administered pilocarpine hydrochloride for juvenile-onset SS patients.
5736,640,"Five female patients, aged from 9 to 16 years, received 5-10 mg/day for 4 weeks."
5737,640,"On days 1 and 28, salivary production was measured by the Saxon test, and patients completed subjective self-evaluations of xerostomia symptoms and were asked about changes in water intake and overall improvement of dry mouth on day 28."
5738,640,"After 4 weeks of pilocarpine administration, salivary production increased significantly in all patients, and overall status was assessed as ""improved"" in all patients."
5739,640,One patient had excessive sweating.
5740,640,No serious adverse events or laboratory examination abnormalities correlated with pilocarpine administration were found.
5741,640,"In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that orally administered pilocarpine is safe and effective for treating xerostomia in juvenile-onset SS patients."
5742,640,This is the first report of the efficacy of pilocarpine for juvenile SS patients; further evaluations are needed to confirm our result.
5743,641,"OBJECTIVES: Chronic obstructive parotitis related to Sjogren syndrome is not uncommon, but it is rarely reported in the literature."
5744,641,The aim of this study was to describe our experience in the treatment of chronic obstructive parotitis related to Sjogren syndrome.
5745,641,"STUDY DESIGN: Seventeen cases of chronic obstructive parotitis related to Sjogren syndrome treated with sialendoscopy from June 2014 to June 2015 at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Stomatology, China Medical University, were retrospectively reviewed."
5746,641,"The cohort underwent ultrasonography, salivary gland scintigraphy, and sialography before sialendoscopy."
5747,641,All patients were asked to complete a visual analogue scale (VAS) evaluation before and 6months after surgery.
5748,641,"A paired t test was conducted, and P<.05 was considered statistically significant."
5749,641,RESULTS: The 17 study patients (27 parotid glands) successfully underwent interventional sialendoscopy under local anesthesia.
5750,641,"The mean preoperative VAS score was 6, and the mean VAS score 6months after sialendoscopy was significantly lower at 4.5 (P<.05)."
5751,641,CONCLUSIONS: Interventional sialendoscopy plays a significant role in the treatment of chronic obstructive parotitis related to Sjogren syndrome.
5752,642,Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically originates from HBV or HCV associated liver cirrhosis.
5753,642,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a kind of autoimmune disease.
5754,642,"A sixty-two year old female patient with mild liver damage was diagnosed with pSS after excluding viral, alcoholic and drug-induced hepatitis according to serum immunological detection and liver biopsy."
5755,642,"But when she was hospitalized for a second time two years later, a CT scan revealed liver neoplasm."
5756,642,Surgery confirmed HCC and liver cirrhosis by pathology.
5757,642,The elevated level of AFP recovered to normal after tumorectomy.
5758,642,"In conclusion, HCC might be a candidate outcome in patients with pSS; it is the doctors' responsibility to keep this kind of patient under surveillance."
5759,643,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a potentially lethal multisystem disorder which could be caused by autoimmune diseases.
5760,643,"However, the concomitant occurrence of TTP and Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an extremely uncommon scenario, especially in male patients."
5761,643,A 56-year-old Chinese male was admitted for the appearance of diffuse ecchymosis.
5762,643,"Then he gradually developed transient slurred speech, progressive confusion, agitation, extremity weakness, and fever."
5763,643,"Laboratory investigations suggested anemia, thrombocytopenia, significantly increased lactic dehydrogenase, schistocytes in peripheral blood smear, and a disintegrin-like metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif type 1 member 13 (ADAMTS13) activity deficiency with high inhibitor titers."
5764,643,TTP was thus diagnosed.
5765,643,"The patient also had positive anti-nuclear antibody, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB; however, anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) was negative."
5766,643,These drove us to perform ocular and dental sicca evaluation and the finial diagnosis was TTP secondary to SS.
5767,643,Plasma exchange and corticosteroid therapy were effective to control TTP.
5768,643,Cyclophosphamide was subsequently added when the platelet count was stable.
5769,643,"The total duration of corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide was 8 and 6months, respectively."
5770,643,The patient recovered without relapse at 1-year follow-up.
5771,643,"To our knowledge, this was the first case of SS initially presented as TTP in a male patient."
5772,643,The case also elucidated the importance of autoantibody screen in the workup of TTP and the benefits of adjunctive immunosuppressive therapy in relapse prevention.
5773,644,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the prevalence, characteristics and outcome of cystic lung disease associated with Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
5774,644,"METHODS: From June 2010 to February 2015, 90 consecutive SS patients [60.114.8years; 88 (97.8%) female, 75 (83.3%) primary SS] had a systematic chest CT-scan."
5775,644,The presence of thin-walled cysts was analyzed by one experienced radiologist.
5776,644,"Demographic data, clinical history, laboratory findings, and pulmonary function tests were extracted retrospectively from medical records."
5777,644,RESULTS: Twenty-one (23.3%) patients had cysts on CT scan performed 40.554.5months after SS diagnosis.
5778,644,Cysts number ranged from 1 to 25 were often bilateral (52.4%) and mostly located in the middle lung zone (76.2%).
5779,644,"Cysts were isolated (n=6, 28.6%) or associated with other lesions, including bronchiectasis (n=5, 23.8%), micronodules (n=5, 23.8%), ground-glass opacity (n=4, 19%) and/or air trapping (n=3, 14.3%)."
5780,644,Most patients with cysts (57.1%) had no respiratory symptoms.
5781,644,"When comparing SS patients with and without cysts, patients with cysts tended to be older (65.315.3 versus 58.514.4years, P=0.06)."
5782,644,Smoking habits were similar in both groups.
5783,644,"Anti-SSB antibodies were more frequently detected in patients with cysts (57.1% vs. 26.1%, P=0.02)."
5784,644,Pulmonary function tests were normal or displayed only mild small airways obstruction and reduced diffusion capacity to carbon monoxide.
5785,644,"Four (19%) patients with cysts had a past history of associated pulmonary disease, including interstitial lung disease."
5786,644,"During follow-up (25.117.7months), no patient developed specific lung disease or lymphoproliferative disorders."
5787,644,"CONCLUSIONS: Cystic lung disease is frequent, benign, associated with anti-SSB/La antibodies and has no impact on outcome in SS."
5788,645,PURPOSE: Co-occurrence of Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) and other autoimmune diseases is rare.
5789,645,We present the case of a patient with co-occurrence of GBS and primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS).
5790,645,CASE REPORT: An 82-year-old woman presented with acute ascending flaccid paralysis and acute respiratory failure.
5791,645,Nerve conduction studies and cerebrospinal fluid analysis confirmed the diagnosis of GBS of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy subtype.
5792,645,The initial unresponsiveness to plasma exchange therapy raised the suspicion of other potential diseases.
5793,645,She was later proved to have underlying pSS.
5794,645,Her neurological deficits and respiratory failure improved dramatically with combination therapy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and immunosuppressive agent.
5795,645,"CONCLUSION: pSS should be considered as a possible cause of refractory GBS, particularly in elderly women."
5796,645,Combination therapy with IVIg and immunosuppressive agent may be beneficial.
5797,646,"Recurrent parotitis is an acute, severe inflammation of one or both parotid glands, the major salivary glands in young children."
5798,646,We report the case of a seven-year old boy with Primary Sjogrens syndrome (PSS) who presented with 15 episodes of painful recurrent bilateral swellings of the parotid glands over a four-year period.
5799,647,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS), a systemic autoimmune disease, is characterized by inflammation of exocrine tissues accompanied by a significant loss of their secretory function."
5800,647,Clinical symptoms develop late and there are no diagnostic tests enabling early diagnosis of SS.
5801,647,"Thus, particularly to study these covert stages, researchers turn to studying animal models where mice provide great freedom for genetic manipulation and testing the effect of experimental intervention."
5802,647,"The present review summarizes current literature pertaining to both spontaneous and extrinsic-factor induced SS-like diseases in mouse models, discussing advantages and disadvantages related to the use of murine models in SS research."
5803,648,"OBJECTIVE: Sjgren's syndrome (SS)-related peripheral neuropathy is responsible for disability, but no treatment has been shown to improve its outcome."
5804,648,"In some cases, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy has been associated with some benefit."
5805,648,"In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of IVIG in SS-related peripheral neuropathy."
5806,648,METHODS: We assessed the efficacy and tolerance of IVIG in 19 patients with primary SS-related neuropathy without any necrotizing vasculitis in a retrospective national multicentric study.
5807,648,The evaluation of the response was assessed using the disability Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) and a global evaluation by the practitioner.
5808,648,"RESULTS: Eight patients (42%) exhibited a decrease of the MRS score corresponding to a clinical improvement, 10 patients (52%) exhibited a stable MRS score, and 1 patient (6%) showed an increase of MRS score."
5809,648,"According to the global evaluation by the practitioner, 9 (47%) of the 19 patients were improved, 6 patients (31%) were stable, and 4 patients (21%) worsened."
5810,648,All the patients with sensorimotor (n = 5) or nonataxic sensory neuropathy (n = 4) were improved or stabilized.
5811,648,"However, among the patients with ataxic neuropathy (n = 9), only 2 improved and 4 worsened."
5812,648,Ten of the 13 patients treated with corticosteroids could have had the prednisone dosage decreased from 15 mg/day (range 7.5-60) to 10 mg/day (range 5-20) with IVIG.
5813,648,Only 1 patient stopped the treatment after 1 dose because of a minor side effect and lack of initial efficacy.
5814,648,CONCLUSION: IVIG may be useful in the treatment of SS-associated sensorimotor neuropathies or nonataxic sensory neuropathy without any necrotizing vasculitis.
5815,648,The benefit of such therapy in the SS-related ataxic neuropathy seems less clear.
5816,649,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate serum cystatin C (cysC) levels in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients, and evaluate its correlation with renal involment."
5817,649,MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-six pSS patients and 65 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled into the study.
5818,649,"Serum cysC, urea, serum creatinine (SCr), creatinine clearance (CrCl), glomerular filtration rates (GFR), Na, K, Mg, Ca, uric acid, P, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), anti-Ro/SS-A, anti-La/SS-B, antinuclear antibodies, 24-h urinary poteinuria and microalbuminuria were evaluated."
5819,649,RESULTS: Mean serum cysC levels did not differ between the patients and healthy controls (P>0.05).
5820,649,Nine patients with pSS had proteinuria over 150mg (and microalbuminuria over 30mg) per 24h.
5821,649,"In patients with proteinuria, serum cysC levels correlated with serum K (r=0.279, P=0.024), ESR (r=0.405, P=0.001) and the disease duration (r=0.235, P=0.04), respectively."
5822,649,"Patients with positive anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies had higher SCr levels compared to those with negative serology (r=0.292, P=0.009, and r=0.259, P=0.022, respectively)."
5823,649,"Nine patients with proteinuria and anti-Ro/SS-A, anti-La/SS-B positivity tended to have lower K and Mg levels which suggests subclinical renal tubular acidosis."
5824,649,CONCLUSION: There were no associations between serum cysC levels and renal involvement in patients with pSS.
5825,649,"However, in patients with proteinuria, serum cysC levels were correlated with acute-phase reactants, suggesting an association with disease activity in terms of degree of inflammation."
5826,650,"INTRODUCTION: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS) is a relatively common immune-mediated condition characterized by oral and ocular dryness, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain and poor health-related quality of life."
5827,650,Other extra-glandular organs can also be affected and PSS is associated with a markedly increased risk of lymphoma.
5828,650,"Furthermore, the health-economic cost for PSS is substantial."
5829,650,There is currently no effective treatment available.
5830,650,"With better understanding of the pathophysiology of PSS and advances in technologies, it is now possible to develop biological therapies to target specific molecules or molecular pathways that are important in PSS pathogenesis."
5831,650,"Indeed, a limited number of biological therapies have already been tested in PSS with mixed successes."
5832,650,"AREAS COVERED: Published data on the use of biological therapies in PSS, the possible roles for other biological therapies and the potential challenges for their use."
5833,650,EXPERT OPINION: The use of biological agents targeting key cellular and molecular pathways in PSS pathogenesis represents a promising therapeutic strategy.
5834,650,Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of biological therapies in PSS should be encouraged but patient selection and outcome measures used in these studies must be carefully considered to ensure that the true effects of biological therapies on the outcomes of PSS are being appropriately evaluated.
5835,651,OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate prevalence and degree of ocular and oral involvement in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS).
5836,651,METHOD: We analysed 134 participants from the Korean Initiative of PSS cohort who completed a 2year follow-up oral and ocular sign test.
5837,651,The severity of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) was determined with the Schirmer I test value (STV) [abnormal (AB) 5mm/5min; normal (N) >5mm/5min].
5838,651,Salivary gland dysfunction (SGD) was determined by unstimulated whole salivary (UWS) flow rate [moderate to severe (MS) <0.1mL/min; mild (Mi) 0.1mL/min].
5839,651,"Subgroups were divided into three groups according to STV and severity of SGD: AB-STV/MS-SGD, AB-STV/Mi-SGD, and N-STV/MS-SGD groups."
5840,651,We analysed the changes in STV and SGD during the follow-up period.
5841,651,"RESULTS: Among the 134 participants enrolled in this study, 105 (78%) were placed in the AB-STV/MS-SGD group, 16 (12%) in the AB-STV/Mi-SGD, and 13 (10%) in the N-STV/MS-SGD at the 2year follow-up."
5842,651,"The AB-STV/Mi-SGD group was younger than the other two groups, and had a lower Xerostomia Inventory score and lower level of (2)-microglobulin."
5843,651,"Participants in the N-STV/MS-SGD group had less hyperimmunoglobulinaemia, rheumatoid factor (RF), and antinuclear antibodies (ANAs)."
5844,651,Patients and those with positive RF or ANA 1:320 at baseline were more likely to have abnormal STV at the 2year follow-up.
5845,651,"CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PSS and positive RF or ANA 1:320 at baseline may benefit from regular ophthalmology examinations, even if they do not have KCS at baseline or dry eye symptoms."
5846,652,OBJECTIVE: To assess the results of 1-minute and 5-minute Schirmer test (ST) when eyes are open (STo) and closed (STc) in normal subjects and patients with dry eye disease.
5847,652,"METHODS: In a comparative, observational case series study, 34 normal volunteers (group 1) and 34 patients with dry eye disease (DED) associated with Sjogren syndrome (group 2) were included in the study."
5848,652,STo and STc for 1 minute and 5 minutes were performed separately for all subjects with an interval of at least 24 hours using Whatman No.
5849,652,41 (5  60 mm) with bended end of the paper inserted into the lateral side of the lower conjunctival fornix.
5850,652,"RESULTS: In group 1, there were 19 females and 15 males with a mean age of 20.8 years (range 18 to 23 years)."
5851,652,"In group 2, there were 29 females and 5 males with a mean age of 53.7 years (range 35 to 75 years)."
5852,652,Mean value of STc was significantly less than STo in both 1 minute and 5 minutes in both groups.
5853,652,One-minute STo and STc showed significantly less wetting than the 5-minute test in both healthy and patients with DED.
5854,652,Normal distribution was observed for all the values.
5855,652,A significant correlation between 1-minute and 5-minute tests in both STo and STc were found in the two groups.
5856,652,"Therefore, two equations were proposed to calculate the 5-minute from 1-minute ST in each group."
5857,652,Statistical analysis did not provide a reliable equation for calculating the standard ST (5-minute STo) from the most comfortable state (1-minute STc).
5858,652,"CONCLUSION: Faster and more comfortable ST (1-minute) is a reliable test to calculate the 5-minute ST in both open and closed eyes, using the provided equations."
5859,652,The 1-minute STc is not a reliable test to calculate the 5-minute STo.
5860,653,A 65-year-old woman was referred to our respiratory department because of incidentally detected endobronchial deposits.
5861,653,She had been diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome 12 years earlier.
5862,653,"Bronchoscopy showed protrusion of the reddened, shiny or edematous mucosa at the orifice of the lower lobe bronchus, suggesting a submucosal tumor."
5863,653,"Based on the pathological findings of the transbronchial biopsied specimens, the patient was diagnosed with non-classified type tracheobronchial amyloidosis associated with Sjgren's syndrome, which was negative for both  and  chains, transthyretin and amyloid A."
5864,653,She has remained in good health without a relapse of the tumor.
5865,654,"Type III interferons (IFNs) or IFN-s (IFN-1/IL29, IFN-2/interleukin (IL)-28A and IFN-3/IL-28B) consist of a recently identified group of IFNs, implicated initially in several human diseases, including cancer and autoimmunity."
5866,654,"In this study, we sought to investigate the expression of type III IFNs and their common receptor IFN-R1/IL-28Ra in Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
5867,654,"Type III IFN expression was examined in minor salivary gland tissues (MSG), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), sera and resting or Toll-like receptor (TLR)-stimulated salivary gland epithelial cells (SGEC) from SS patients and sicca-complaining controls."
5868,654,All type III IFN family members were detected in ductal and acinar epithelia of MSGs from both SS patients and sicca controls.
5869,654,IFN-2/IL-28A and IFN-3/IL-28B were also expressed in infiltrating mononuclear cells.
5870,654,"In SS patients with intermediate MSG lesions, the epithelial expression of IFN-2/IL-28A was more intense compared to sicca controls (P<005)."
5871,654,"The receptor IFN-R1/IL-28Ra was detected in all types of cells except fibroblasts, and was exceptionally strong in plasmatocytoid dendritic cells, indicating that they are susceptible to type III IFN-mediated regulation."
5872,654,"In the periphery, only IFN-1/IL-29 was detected in the sera and was elevated significantly in SS patients with intermediate MSG inflammatory lesions compared to sicca controls (P=00053)."
5873,654,"None of the type III IFNs was expressed constitutively in resting SGECs; they were all induced readily by TLR-3 stimulation, suggesting that the in-situ epithelial expression can be attributed to local microenvironment."
5874,654,"Type III IFNs are expressed in MSGs in a similar pattern to type I IFNs and their expression is probably subjected to micro-environmental regulation, suggesting that they are implicated in the inflammatory processes occurring in the affected exocrine glands."
5875,655,The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic utility of visual versus semi-quantitative analysis of salivary gland scintigraphy in the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
5876,655,"PATIENTS, METHODS: 99mTc-pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy was performed in 145 patients (133 women, 12 men) with clinically suspicious SS."
5877,655,The images were interpreted with visual and semiquantitative methods and the diagnostic performances for SS were compared using uptake and excretory functional parameters.
5878,655,"RESULTS: In total, 76 patients (52.4%) were finally diagnosed with SS."
5879,655,"The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of visual analysis for the diagnosis of SS were 88.2%, 48.6%, 65.1%, 79.1%, and 69.2%, respectively."
5880,655,"Semiquantitative values, the area under the ROC curve for uptake ratio and percentage excretion in the right salivary glands were signicantly greater than 0.5 (p < 0.05)."
5881,655,"However, the percentage excretion in the left salivary glands did not show a statistically significant diagnostic ability for SS."
5882,655,The diagnostic ability of visual assessment was greater than that of the semiquantitative method in terms of evaluating uptake and excretory function in the submandibular glands.
5883,655,"CONCLUSION: Visual analysis of salivary gland scintigraphy showed greater diagnostic utility than semiquantitative assessment in the diagnosis of SS, especially in the submandibular glands."
5884,656,OBJECTIVES: To describe and compare the clinical and biological characteristics of subjects with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) with and without anti-RNP antibodies.
5885,656,"METHODS: Patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/EULAR 2016 criteria for pSS and having anti-RNP antibodies, without other connective tissue disease diagnosed and no anti-dsDNA antibodies were retrieved from the database from our French National Reference Center."
5886,656,"These patients were compared with all other patients with pSS with negative anti-Sm, anti-RNP and anti-dsDNA antibodies."
5887,656,"RESULTS: Overall, 21 patients with pSS positive for anti-RNP antibodies and 446 negative for anti-RNP antibodies were retrieved."
5888,656,"Anti-RNP-positive patients had a lower median age at onset of pSS symptoms (41.0 vs 50.0 years, p=0.01), a higher median EULAR Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index at inclusion (8.0 vs 3.0, p<0.01), more frequently constitutional symptoms (14.3% vs 0.01%, p<0.01), myositis (19.0% vs 2.3%, p<0.01) and pulmonary (19.0% vs 5.7%, p=0.04) involvement."
5889,656,"Moreover, anti-RNP-positive patients had higher median gammaglobulin levels (22.5 vs 13g/L, p<0.01), more frequently anti-SSA antibodies (90.5% vs 67.1%, p=0.03), but less frequent lymphocytic sialadenitis with a focus score 1 (66.7% vs 85.5%, p=0.03)."
5890,656,"If the analysis is restricted to anti-SSA-positive patients, anti-RNP positivity is associated with the same clinicobiologic features except the pulmonary involvement."
5891,656,"CONCLUSION: Patients with pSS with anti-RNP antibodies displayed a more active systemic disease, with more frequent muscular and pulmonary involvement, and increased gammaglobulin level, compared with anti-RNP-negative patients."
5892,657,OBJECTIVE: To characterize the ultrasound (US) pattern of joint involvement in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
5893,657,"METHODS: Seventeen patients with pSS, 18 with secondary Sjgren's syndrome (sSS), and 17 healthy controls underwent US examinations of various articular regions."
5894,657,"Synovitis (synovial hypertrophy/joint effusion), power Doppler (PD) signals, and erosions were assessed."
5895,657,"RESULTS: In patients with pSS, synovitis was found in the metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP, 76%), wrists (76%), and knees (76%), while the proximal interphalangeal joints, elbows, and ankles were mostly unscathed."
5896,657,"Intra-articular PD signals were occasionally detected in wrists (12%), elbows (6%), and knees (6%)."
5897,657,"Erosions were evident in the wrists of three (18%) patients with pSS, one of these also having anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies."
5898,657,"While US synovitis does not discriminate between sSS and pSS, demonstration of bone erosions in the 2nd MCP joints showed 28.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity for diagnosing sSS; in comparison, these figures were 72.2 and 94.1% for circulating anti-CCP antibodies."
5899,657,"CONCLUSIONS: In pSS, the pattern of joint involvement by US is polyarticular, bilateral, and symmetrical."
5900,657,"Synovitis is the US sign most commonly found in patients with pSS, especially in MCP joints, wrists, and knees, and bone erosions also may occur."
5901,658,OBJECTIVE: Patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) have higher fatigue levels and also suffer from excessive day time sleepiness.
5902,658,The underlying mechanisms for this are not fully understood.
5903,658,"Knowing that these patients have higher salivary surface tension, we postulated that sleep disordered breathing (SDB) would be more common and would be a contributor to these symptoms amongst pSS patients."
5904,658,We investigated the prevalence of SDB in pSS patients and its relationship to their symptoms of fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness.
5905,658,"METHODS: This was an observational study of 28 pSS patients (meanSEM age, 58.71.9) and 18 healthy subjects (meanSEM age, 55.83.4) matched for age, sex, and BMI."
5906,658,All the participants underwent an overnight polysomnography.
5907,658,"The two groups were compared for fatigue, sleepiness, anxiety, and depression scores, and for the frequency of obstructive apneas and hypopneas during sleep."
5908,658,Correlation analyses were used to explore relationships between sleep study variables and excess sleepiness and fatigue.
5909,658,"RESULTS: Fatigue, sleepiness, anxiety and depression symptoms, and sleep onset latency were significantly greater in pSS patients than controls."
5910,658,"pSS patients had twice the frequency of obstructive apneas and hypopneas compared with control subjects (median[IQR],18.6/h [10.4-40.1] vs. 9.9/h [6.5-23.4]; p=0.032) and OSA defined as an apnea-hypopnea index >15 events/h of sleep was more prevalent amongst pSS patients than controls (64% vs. 28%; p=0.033)."
5911,658,"While no significant correlations were found between parameters of sleep disordered breathing and sleepiness scores or fatigue scores in the pSS group, CPAP treatment in a small subset of the pSS who were more severely affected by OSA suggested significant symptomatic benefit."
5912,658,CONCLUSION: OSA appears to be increased in pSS and may be a useful therapeutic target to improve the quality of life of these patients.
5913,659,"Objective: To reveal clinical features, pathological diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of primary thymic mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and review literatures."
5914,659,"Methods: The clinical characteristics, pathological diagnosis, laboratory texts, treatment and prognosis of 7 cases of primary thymic MALT lymphoma identified at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from November 2017 to January 2019 were collected and analyzed."
5915,659,"Results: Of 7 primary thymic MALT lymphoma cases, six were female."
5916,659,"Patients were often asymptomatic and were found mediastinal mass by chest CT. After mediastinal mass resection, pathologist reported a primary thymic MALT lymphoma."
5917,659,"Laboratory tests showed all patients were positive for anti-nuclear antibody, anti-Ro52 antibodies and anti-Sjogren's syndrome A antibodies, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ."
5918,659,Four were diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) .
5919,659,"After surgery, the patients were given the positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) scans."
5920,659,"All cases received ""watch and wait"" approach."
5921,659,"Up to now, all cases showed good prognoses and none of them relapsed."
5922,659,"Conclusion: Primary thymic MALT lymphoma was rare, and it was often associated with autoimmune diseases."
5923,659,Such patients who usually had good prognoses should be followed up closely and avoided excessive treatments if there were no indications of intervention.
5924,660,"Establishing a diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) has been difficult without sensitive laboratory markers, and in light of the non-specificity of the symptoms of dry eyes and mouth."
5925,660,"Rather than complaints about dry eyes or dry mouth, objective symptoms and extraglandular manifestations should raise suspicion of SS."
5926,660,This evaluation requires the detection of antibodies against Ro (SSA) and La (SSB) or a pathologic salivary gland biopsy.
5927,660,"Since an invasive biopsy is not always performed, further diagnostic markers are required."
5928,660,"Recently antibodies against alpha-fodrin have been shown to be present in the majority of untreated patients, and can be used in the screening process of SS as an additional marker."
5929,661,OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to verify whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) might help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of cardiovascular events (CV) in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
5930,661,"METHODS: 408 pSS patients (395 F: 13 M), with a mean age of 61 (14) years and mean disease duration of 8.8 (7.8) years were retrospectively included."
5931,661,CV risk factors and events were analysed and correlated with the other pSS clinical and serological manifestations by using both a traditional statistical approach (i.e.
5932,661,"Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC)) and Auto-CM, a data mining tool based on ANNs."
5933,661,"RESULTS: Five percent of pSS patients experienced one or more CV events, including heart failure (8/408), transient ischaemic attack (6/408), stroke (4/408), angina (4/408), myocardial infarction (3/408) and peripheral obliterative arteriopathy (2/408)."
5934,661,The AHC provided a dendrogram with at least three clusters that did not allow us to infer specific differential associations among variables (i.e.
5935,661,CV comorbidity and pSS manifestations).
5936,661,"On the other hand, Auto-CM identified two different patterns of distributions in CV risk factors, pSS-related features, and CV events."
5937,661,"The first pattern, centered on ""non-ischaemic CV events/generic condition of HF"", was characterised by the presence of traditional CV risk factors and by a closer link with pSS glandular features rather than to pSS extra-glandular manifestations."
5938,661,"The second pattern included ""ischaemic neurological, cardiac events and peripheral obliterative arteriopathy"" and appeared to be strictly associated with extra-glandular disease activity and longer disease duration."
5939,661,CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first application of ANNs to the analysis of factors contributing to CV events in pSS.
5940,661,"When compared to AHC, ANNs had the advantage of better stratifying CV risk in pSS, opening new avenues for planning specific interventions to prevent long-term CV complications in pSS patients."
5941,662,BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic rheumatic disease in which gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common.
5942,662,Faecal calprotectin (FC) is a non-invasive biomarker that has been suggested to discriminate organic intestinal disease from functional disorders.
5943,662,The purpose of this study was to explore the usefulness of FC testing in patients with pSS.
5944,662,"METHODS: In total, 56 consecutive patients with pSS and 29 healthy control subjects were included in this cross-sectional study."
5945,662,FC was measured with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.
5946,662,GI symptoms were evaluated with the Rome III questionnaire and the Visual Analogue Scale for Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
5947,662,"In patients with pSS, disease activity was estimated using the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), and patient-reported outcomes were evaluated with the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient-Reported Index."
5948,662,"RESULTS: Patients with pSS had higher levels of FC than healthy control subjects (median 54g/g, interquartile range [IQR 20-128]; vs. 20g/g [20-43]; p=0.002)."
5949,662,"Concomitant organic GI disease was found in 14 patients with pSS and included inflammatory bowel disease (n=3), colonic adenoma (n=2) and GI lymphoma (n=1)."
5950,662,Patients with organic GI disease had higher FC levels than the other patients with pSS (median 274g/g [IQR 61-363] vs. median 34g/g [IQR 20-76]; p<0.001).
5951,662,"Although patients with pSS reported abdominal discomfort more frequently than healthy control subjects did, such symptoms were not associated with organic GI disease or elevated FC levels."
5952,662,FC correlated moderately with ESSDAI.
5953,662,"Excluding patients with organic GI disease, we did not identify any significant association between ESSDAI and FC levels."
5954,662,CONCLUSIONS: GI symptoms are frequent in pSS.
5955,662,"Contrary to patient-reported outcomes, elevated FC levels in pSS indicate possible organic GI disease that warrants further investigation."
5956,663,BACKGROUND: Dry eye is a common problem in Ophthalmology and may occur for many reasons including Sjogren's syndrome (SS).
5957,663,"Recent studies have identified autoantibodies, anti-salivary gland protein 1 (SP1), anti-carbonic anhydrase 6 (CA6) and anti-parotid secretory protein (PSP), which occur early in the course of SS."
5958,663,The current studies were designed to evaluate how many patients with idiopathic dry eye and no evidence of systemic diseases from a dry eye practice have these autoantibodies.
5959,663,METHODS: Patients from a dry eye clinic and normal controls were assessed by Schirmer's test for tear flow.
5960,663,Sera were assessed for autoantibodies using ELISA assays.
5961,663,Statistics was performed with Prism 7 software and student's unpaired t test.
5962,663,RESULTS: In this study 60% of the dry eye patients expressed one of these autoantibodies.
5963,663,"Only 30% expressed one of the autoantibodies associated with long-standing SS, which are included in the diagnostic criteria for SS, anti-Ro and anti-La."
5964,663,"Patients with disease for less than 2years and mild dry eyes did not express anti-Ro or anti-La, while 25% expressed anti-SP1."
5965,663,"Similar observations, with smaller numbers, were made when patients had not only dry eye but also dry mouth."
5966,663,"CONCLUSIONS: Antibodies to SP1, CA6 and PSP occur in some patients with idiopathic dry eyes."
5967,663,Further studies will be needed to determine how many of these patients go on to develop systemic manifestations of SS.
5968,663,Testing for these autoantibodies may allow early recognition of patients with SS.
5969,663,This will lead to improved management of the patients and the development of new strategies to maintain normal lacrimal and salivary gland function in patients with SS.
5970,664,OBJECTIVE: Th17 cells have been demonstrated to play an important role in the onset and development of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
5971,664,"In this study, we evaluated the expansion and clinical significance of circulating CD4+CD161+ T cell and its ""effector"" (CD4+CD25-CD161+ T cell) and ""regulatory"" (CD4+CD25+CD161+ T cell) subpopulations."
5972,664,METHODS: Fifty-eight pSS patients and 16 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in our study.
5973,664,The cell populations and intracellular IL-17 expression were analyzed by flow cytometry.
5974,664,The disease activity was evaluated by the EULAR-SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI).
5975,664,Autoantibodies were measured by ELISA or indirect immunofluorescence assay.
5976,664,RESULTS: The CD161+ T cell fractions showed higher proportions of IL-17-producing cells.
5977,664,The frequencies of the overall CD4+CD161+ T cell population and its effector subset were positively correlated with disease activity parameters and more severe disease manifestations.
5978,664,A significant elevation of the CD4+CD25+CD161+ T cell subpopulation was observed in the peripheral blood of pSS patients compared to HCs and this subset showed decreased regulatory functions compared with the CD4+CD25+CD161- population.
5979,664,CONCLUSION: Circulating CD4+CD161+ T cell populations associated with pSS disease activity and severity.
5980,664,These cells might be involved in the development of pSS and could be potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of pSS.
5981,665,Airway and cystic lung diseases can be observed in patients with Sjgren's syndrome.
5982,665,"We report a case of such a patient suffering from respiratory failure due to recurrent episodes of right pneumothorax, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation."
5983,665,"Despite thoracic drainage and adequate pneumothorax management, the patient could not be weaned from the ventilator."
5984,665,Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed severe central excessive dynamic airway collapse of the lower part of the trachea and proximal bronchi.
5985,665,"The severity of airway collapse was maximal at the intermediate bronchus level, with a near-complete obstruction during expiration."
5986,665,Inspiratory and expiratory computed tomography studies confirmed the fiberoptic findings and suggested a possible expiratory posterior compression of the intermediate bronchus by parenchymal lung cysts.
5987,665,"Stenting was considered, but the patient died from ventilator-associated pneumonia before the procedure could be performed."
5988,665,This case is the first description of severe central excessive dynamic airway collapse in a patient with primary Sjgren's syndrome complicated by diffuse airway and cystic lung disease.
5989,666,A minor salivary gland (SG) biopsy with focal lymphocytic sialadenitis and a focus score of 1 is today's widely accepted pathological finding confirming the SG component of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
5990,666,Adipocytes can occupy a large percentage of the SG area although little is known about their significance in SS lesions.
5991,666,This study aimed to characterise adipose tissue infiltration in labial SG biopsies from 27 SS patients and 28 non-SS sicca controls.
5992,666,"Biopsies were evaluated by one oral pathologist and assessed for focus score, acinar atrophy, fatty replacement and non-specific chronic inflammation."
5993,666,"Moreover, to explore the SG microenvironment, immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded SG tissue was performed using interleukin-6 (IL-6)."
5994,666,The fatty replacement was evident in all SS patients possessing autoantibodies (Ro/SSA and/or La/SSB) as well as a positive SG biopsy (focus score 1).
5995,666,"Additionally, 62% of SS patients having autoantibodies but a negative biopsy showed fatty infiltration (FI) while non-SS controls demonstrated fatty replacement in only 32% of the cases."
5996,666,"Overall, the SS group (mean age 53.0 years) had a significantly higher incidence (p value 0.005) of FI than the non-SS controls (mean age 54.8 years)."
5997,666,"Interestingly, adipocytes were located in IL-6 rich areas, and IL-6 positive adipocytes were detected."
5998,666,"As fat deposition seems to be more recurrent in SGs affected by SS, we propose the assessment of adipose tissue replacement as a helpful tool for diagnostic evaluation in SS."
5999,666,Detection of IL-6 positive adipocytes suggests their involvement in immune reactions.
6000,666,"Still, functional studies are needed to investigate the SG microenvironment further."
6001,667,"Neurological symptoms occur in approximately 20% of patients with Sjgren's syndrome, and may be the presenting manifestations of the disease."
6002,667,"Here, we review several neurological conditions that can occur in Sjgren's syndrome: sensory ganglionopathy, painful small fibre neuropathy, and transverse myelitis (independently or as part of neuromyelitis optica)."
6003,667,"We present the symptoms, signs, differential diagnoses, recommended diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of each of these, highlighting the features that should alert neurologists to consider Sjgren's syndrome."
6004,668,OBJECTIVES: There is conflicting evidence regarding prognosis in patients with primary SS (pSS).
6005,668,"The aim of this study was to estimate the rate, risk factors and causes of mortality in patients with pSS through a systematic review and meta-analysis."
6006,668,"METHODS: Through a systematic review of multiple databases through October 2014, we identified cohort studies reporting relative risk (compared with standardized population), risk factors and causes of mortality in patients with pSS."
6007,668,We estimated summary risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs using random effects model.
6008,668,"RESULTS: We identified 10 studies with 7888 patients (91% females) with pSS, of whom 682 patients died over a median average follow-up of 9 years."
6009,668,"The pooled standardized mortality ratio in patients with pSS was 1.38 (95% CI 0.94, 2.01)."
6010,668,"Leading causes of mortality were cardiovascular diseases, solid-organ and lymphoid malignancies and infections; however, it is unclear whether these observed causes were overrepresented in patients with pSS as compared with the general population."
6011,668,"Risk factors associated with increased mortality were advanced age at diagnosis [RR 1.09 (95% CI 1.07, 1.12)], male sex [RR 2.18 (95% CI 1.45, 3.27)], parotid enlargement [RR 1.81 (95% CI 1.02, 3.21)], abnormal parotid scintigraphy [RR 2.96 (95% CI 1.36, 6.45)], extraglandular involvement [RR 1.77 (95% CI 1.06, 2.95)], vasculitis [RR 7.27 (95% CI 2.70, 19.57)], anti-SSB positivity [RR 1.45 (95% CI 1.03, 2.04)], low C3 [RR 2.14 (95% CI 1.38, 3.32)] and C4 [RR 3.08 (95% CI 2.14, 4.42)] and cryoglobulinaemia [RR 2.62 (95% CI 1.77, 3.90)]."
6012,668,CONCLUSION: pSS is not associated with an increase in all-cause mortality as compared with the general population.
6013,668,"However, a subset of patients with extraglandular involvement, vasculitis, hypocomplementaemia and cryoglobulinaemia may be at increased risk of mortality and require close follow-up."
6014,669,"OBJECTIVES: To define the incidence rate of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and the prevalence of extraglandular manifestations (EGMs) at the time of diagnosis of pSS in a prospective, population-based manner."
6015,669,METHOD: This study included all consecutive patients referred to the Department of Rheumatology at Karolinska University Hospital for the investigation of incident pSS from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011.
6016,669,"Investigation was according to the current criteria for pSS, and examination with a focus on the presence of EGMs was performed."
6017,669,"RESULTS: Of the referred individuals, 199 out of 781 were diagnosed with pSS."
6018,669,We found an annual incidence rate of pSS in the Karolinska University Hospital catchment area of 3.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-4.3] cases per 100000 adult inhabitants.
6019,669,"The female/male ratio of incident cases was 14/1 [frequency (female) = 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.96]."
6020,669,"In our cohort, we noted lower figures for severe EGMs such as lung and neurological involvement than previously reported for prevalent pSS."
6021,669,"The frequency of autoantibodies including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-Ro/SSA, and anti-La/SSB was also lower compared to other cohorts."
6022,669,"In our study, autoantibody-positive patients had cytopaenia significantly more often, and in patients older than 60 years primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) was more common."
6023,669,CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate of pSS is 3.1 (95% CI 2.3-4.3) per 100000 person-years.
6024,669,"The prevalence of autoantibodies may be lower than previously reported, and at diagnosis, patients with pSS have few severe EGMs."
6025,670,OBJECTIVES: To assess the use of antimalarials and to evaluate their association with damage accrual in a Latino-American cohort of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
6026,670,"METHODS: We included 377 patients attending three tertiary referral centers from: Argentina (n=110), Brazil (n=49) and Mexico (n=218)."
6027,670,"We retrospectively registered demographics, disease duration and use of prednisone (PDN), immunosupressors and antimalarials."
6028,670,We scored the cumulative ESSDAI and the SSDDI at last follow-up.
6029,670,"RESULTS: Most patients were females, median disease duration 6 years, mean SSDDI score 2.71.8, mean cumulative ESSDAI score 9.38.3, 39% used PDN and 37.4% immunosupressors."
6030,670,"A total of 191 patients (50.6%) had ever used antimalarials, mean use 43.540 months, being the main indication arthritis."
6031,670,"These patients had a longer disease duration, used more PDN and immunosupressors and had lower SSDDI scores."
6032,670,"The pleuro-pulmonary domain was significant different among groups (6.7% antimalarials users vs.14.9% not users, p=0.01)."
6033,670,"At the logistic regression, the pleuro-pulmonary domain (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17-0.78, p=0.01), the age (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.99, p=0.01) and the disease duration (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.1, p=0.0001) were associated with antimalarials use."
6034,670,"When we compared patients with a SSDDI 3 vs. SSDDI<3, in the multivariate analysis the use of antimalarial was protective (OR 0.58, 0.36-0.93 CI 95%, p=0.02) and the cumulative ESSDAI a risk factor for damage accrual (OR 1.1, 1.07-1.15 CI 95%, p<0.001)."
6035,670,"CONCLUSIONS: Antimalarials were frequently used in pSS and seemed to protect against damage accrual, specifically at the pleuro-pulmonary domain."
6036,670,This finding should be confirmed in prospective studies.
6037,671,To compare the effects of treatment with punctal plugs versus artificial tears on visual function for primary Sjgren's syndrome with dry eye.
6038,671,Forty-two eyes of 42 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome were enrolled and were allocated randomly into artificial tears (AT) group and punctal plugs (PP) group.
6039,671,"Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) was used, and fluorescent staining for tear film break-up time (BUT), the Schirmer test I (STI) and contrast sensitivity was performed before treatment and was repeated 3 months after treatment."
6040,671,"A follow-up of 3 months was achieved in 40 eyes of 40 patients, including 19 eyes in artificial tears group and 21 eyes in punctal plugs group."
6041,671,"Statistically significant improvements were observed in the OSDI scores (AT: 52.6  5.7, 15.9  4.2; PP: 55.8  4.9, 15.1  4.2), corneal fluorescein staining scores (AT: 2.60  1.76, 0.30  0.57; PP: 1.91  1.60, 0.09  0.29), STI (AT: 3.85  2.03, 8.95  2.72; PP: 3.36  1.62, 11.41  2.65), and BUT (AT: 2.60  1.39, 6.00  1.81; PP: 2.27  1.12, 7.82  1.84) after treatment compared to those of pre-treatment."
6042,671,The values of STI (AT: 5.10  1.80; PP: 8.05  1.53) and BUT (AT: 3.40  1.31; PP: 5.68  1.13) in punctal plugs group were significantly more improved than those in the artificial tears group.
6043,671,"The medium- and high-level frequencies contrast sensitivities were greatly improved in simulated daylight, night, and glare disability conditions after treatment with artificial tears and punctal plugs."
6044,671,"However, the changes in contrast sensitivity did not significantly differ between groups."
6045,671,"Both artificial tears and punctal plugs relieved dry eye symptoms, repaired corneal lesions, enhanced tear film stability, and improved contrast sensitivity."
6046,671,Punctal plugs could improve tear film stability and elongate the BUT better than artificial tears.
6047,672,"AIM: To evaluate the stiffness of parotid and submandibular glands using elastography ultrasound and to correlate it with B-mode ultrasonographical, clinical and serological features, salivary profibrotic and inflammatory chemokines, and salivary gland fibrosis."
6048,672,METHODS: We performed B-mode and elastography ultrasound of major salivary glands of 26 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome.
6049,672,We registered the shear wave velocity (SWV) and correlated it with the morphologic ultrasonographic changes assessed by the Hocevar scale.
6050,672,"We assessed the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), non-stimulated whole salivary flow rate (NSWSF), C3 and C4 levels, anti-Ro/La antibodies, salivary inflammatory (C-X-C motif ligand 13 [CXCL13], CXCL10, CXCL8, C-C motif ligand 2 [CCL2], interleukin 10 [IL-10] and IL-6) and pro-fibrotic (CXCL14, CCL28, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and transforming growth factor ) chemokines and cytokines and evaluated the presence of fibrosis in the minor salivary gland."
6051,672,RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of patients were women; mean age was 51.111years; median disease duration was 6.1years; 92.3% had oral symptoms and 26.9% fibrosis.
6052,672,"The median B-mode score was 22.2 points and the median SWV 2.5m/s (=0.53, P=0.001)."
6053,672,"The SWV correlated with the NSWSF (=-0.53, P=0.001), ESSDAI (=0.31, P=0.03), glandular ESDDAI domain (=0.36, P=0.02), C4 levels (=-0.32, P=0.04), salivary CXCL13 (=0.29, P=0.03) and CXCL10 (=0.30, P=0.003), but not with age and fibrosis."
6054,672,"CONCLUSION: WV correlated with the B-mode ultrasound score, systemic and glandular activity and in a large degree with CXCL10, an inflammatory chemokine, but not with fibrosis."
6055,672,An increased SWV might represent chronic glandular inflammation rather than fibrotic changes in these patients.
6056,673,PURPOSE: To compare tear osmolarity (TO) and other dry eye parameters in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with or without secondary Sjogren syndrome (sSS).
6057,673,"METHODS: Consecutive patients with RA were divided into a sSS group and no-sSS group using conventional diagnostic criteria by rheumatologists using symptomatology, Schirmer test score, and anti-Ro or anti-La autoantibody status."
6058,673,"The TO, Ocular Surface Disease Index, dry eye disease (DED) parameters [such as tear breakup time (TBUT) and corneal staining score] and the systemic inflammatory markers [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)] were compared."
6059,673,Correlation analyses between TO and the DED parameters and inflammatory markers were also performed.
6060,673,"RESULTS: A total of 42 cases with mean age 54.8  12.3 were included, with 12 patients (29%) having sSS and 30 (71%) without sSS."
6061,673,"TO was increased in both groups (329  20 and 319  25 mOsm/L, respectively), but no statistically significant difference was found between the 2 groups (P = 0.126)."
6062,673,"RA with sSS had significantly shorter TBUT, higher corneal staining score, and ESR CRP levels (P < 0.05)."
6063,673,"TO did not correlate with the Schirmer test score, but had significant positive correlations with age, corneal staining score, ESR, and CRP levels, and a significant negative correlation with TBUT."
6064,673,CONCLUSIONS: TO was increased in RA patients with or without sSS.
6065,673,"There was no significant correlation between TO and the Schirmer test score, and the physician could not use TO to diagnose sSS."
6066,673,"However, TO correlated well with both DED parameters (TBUT and corneal staining score) and systemic inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP)."
6067,674,OBJECTIVE: To develop a novel method for capturing the discrepancy between objective tests and subjective dryness symptoms (a sensitivity scale) and to explore predictors of dryness sensitivity.
6068,674,METHODS: Archive data from the UK Primary Sjgren's Syndrome Registry (n = 688) were used.
6069,674,Patients were classified on a scale from -5 (stoical) to +5 (sensitive) depending on the degree of discrepancy between their objective and subjective symptoms classes.
6070,674,"Sensitivity scores were correlated with demographic variables, disease-related factors, and symptoms of pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression."
6071,674,RESULTS: Patients were on average relatively stoical for both types of dryness symptoms (mean  SD ocular dryness -0.42  2.2 and -1.24  1.6 oral dryness).
6072,674,Twenty-seven percent of patients were classified as sensitive to ocular dryness and 9% to oral dryness.
6073,674,Hierarchical regression analyses identified the strongest predictor of ocular dryness sensitivity to be self-reported pain and that of oral dryness sensitivity to be self-reported fatigue.
6074,674,CONCLUSION: Ocular and oral dryness sensitivity can be classified on a continuous scale.
6075,674,The 2 symptom types are predicted by different variables.
6076,674,"A large number of factors remain to be explored that may impact symptom sensitivity in primary Sjgren's syndrome, and the proposed method could be used to identify relatively sensitive and stoical patients for future studies."
6077,675,OBJECTIVE: Ultrasonography (US) is a sensitive tool in the diagnosis of major salivary gland abnormalities in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
6078,675,The aim of this systematic review was to assess the metric properties of this technique.
6079,675,METHODS: PUBMED and EMBASE databases were searched.
6080,675,All publications between January 1988 and January 2013 were considered.
6081,675,Data were extracted from the articles meeting the inclusion criteria according to US definition of salivary gland scoring system and metric properties studied.
6082,675,"The type and number of glands tested, study design and metric properties according to OMERACT filter (truth, discrimination, feasibility) were assessed."
6083,675,"RESULTS: Of 167 publications identified initially with PUBMED and EMBASE, 31 met the inclusion criteria."
6084,675,The number of pSS patients varied among the studies from 16 to 140.
6085,675,The diagnosis of pSS was in line in most of the cases with the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) classification criteria for Sjgren's syndrome.
6086,675,The US examination was performed in suspected pSS only in studies in which the sensitivity ranged from 45.8 to 91.6% and specificity from 73 to 98.1%.
6087,675,There was heterogeneity in regard to the definition of US in B-mode and few studies used US in colour Doppler.
6088,675,Few studies reported reliability of US and sensitivity to change in pSS.
6089,675,CONCLUSION: US is a valuable tool for detecting salivary gland abnormalities in pSS.
6090,675,Its reliability has been poorly investigated and there is considerable variation in the definition of US abnormalities.
6091,675,Further studies are required to validate and standardize the US definition of salivary gland in pSS.
6092,676,"AIM: In our study, we aimed to evaluate left ventricular function in patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS) using tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE) and myocardial performance index (MPI) in addition to conventional echocardiographic methods."
6093,676,METHODS: We evaluated 50 patients with SS and 48 healthy volunteers with similar demographic characteristics.
6094,676,"Systolic and diastolic functions of the left ventricle were analyzed with standard two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography, M-mode echocardiography, pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging."
6095,676,"RESULTS: Septal part of the mitral annulus PW TDE showed that systolic myocardial wave (Sm), early diastolic myocardial wave (Em), late diastolic myocardial wave (Am) and Em/Am ratios are significantly lower, and myocardial isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRTm) and MPI values are significantly higher in patients with SS."
6096,676,"Lateral site of the mitral annulus PW TDE showed that Em, Sm and Em/Am ratios are significantly lower, and IVRTm and MPI values are significantly higher in patients with SS compared with healthy controls."
6097,676,"CONCLUSION: In this study, it was shown that both left ventricle systolic and diastolic functions of patients with SS were disturbed."
6098,677,"Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic, autoimmune disorder characterized by salivary insufficiency and lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands."
6099,677,"Even though the mechanism of its pathology and progression has been researched ever since its discovery, the roles of different parts of immune system remain inconclusive."
6100,677,"There is no straightforward and simple theory for the pathogenesis and diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome because of the multiple kinds and functions of autoantibodies, changing proportion of different T-lymphocyte subsets with the progression of disease, unsuspected abilities of B lymphocytes discovered recently, crosstalk between cytokines connecting the factors mentioned previously, and genetic predisposition that contributes to the initiation of this disease."
6101,677,"On the other hand, the number of significant reports and open-label studies of B-cell depletion therapy showing clinical efficacy in sjogren's syndrome has continued to accumulate, which provides a promising future for the patients."
6102,677,"In a word, further elucidation of the role of different components of the immune system will open avenues for better diagnosis and treatment of SS, whose current management is still mainly supportive."
6103,678,"BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) is a common autoimmune condition which primarily affects epithelial tissue, often including the kidney causing either tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) or more rarely, an immune complex related glomerulonephritis."
6104,678,"METHODS: We describe the clinical, biochemical and histological characteristics of 12 patients with pSS related TIN and their response to treatment with antiproliferative agents."
6105,678,All 12 patients were investigated and treated at the UCL Centre for Nephrology in London.
6106,678,RESULTS: All patients had TIN demonstrated via needle biopsy; immunophenotyping showed that the interstitial infiltrate was predominantly a CD4+ T-cell infiltrate.
6107,678,Urinary acidification testing demonstrated distal renal tubular acidosis in 8 patients.
6108,678,Proximal tubular dysfunction was present in 5 patients.
6109,678,All but 1 patient were treated with antiproliferative agents and most also with a reducing course of steroids.
6110,678,"In the treated patients, there was a significant improvement in the serum creatinine and measured GFR."
6111,678,CONCLUSION: Patients with pSS TIN have significant renal impairment and other functional tubular defects.
6112,678,There is a mononuclear lymphocytic infiltrate on renal biopsy and this appears to be mainly a CD4+ T-cell infiltrate.
6113,678,Treatment with mycophenolate (and corticosteroids) improves the renal function in patients with pSS TIN.
6114,679,AIM: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the salivary and lacrimal glands.
6115,679,There is increasing evidence indicating that vitamin D is important in the initiation and propogation of a range of autoimmune diseases which may include SS.
6116,679,The aim of the present study was to evaluate plasma vitamin D (vit D) levels in patients with SS and to compare this with a control group.
6117,679,METHOD: One hundred and seven SS patients (97 [90.7%] female and 10 [9.3%] male) and 74 healthy controls (64 [86.5%] female and 10 [13.5%] male) were included into the study.
6118,679,Plasma baseline 25-hydroxy-vit D levels were measured by high-powered liquid chromatography method using an Agilent 1100 liquid chromatograph.
6119,679,RESULTS: Plasma vit D levels in SS patients (20.510.5g/L) were significantly lower than in the control group (28.415.2g/L) (P<0.001).
6120,679,Female SS patients had significanly lower vit D levels (19.39.3g/L) than controls (28.315.8g/L) (P<0.001) but this difference was not present among the male patients and controls.
6121,679,There was no correlation between plasma vit D levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein in SS patients.
6122,679,CONCLUSION: Vit D deficiency was frequent in patients with SS.
6123,679,"In particular, female SS patients had the risk of vit D deficiency."
6124,679,It may be convenient to look for vit D deficiency and to correct vit D nutritional status in SS patients.
6125,680,OBJECTIVES: To analyse the clinical features and outcomes of patients presenting with life-threatening systemic disease in a large cohort of Spanish patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
6126,680,"METHODS: The GEAS-SS multicentre registry was formed in 2005 with the aim of collecting a large series of Spanish patients with primary SS, and included more than 20 Spanish reference centres with substantial experience in the management of SS patients."
6127,680,"By January 2018, the database included 1580 consecutive patients fulfilling the 2002 classification criteria for primary SS."
6128,680,"Severe, life-threatening systemic disease was defined as an activity level scored as ""high"" in at least one ESSDAI domain."
6129,680,"RESULTS: Among 1580 patients, 208 (13%) were classified as presenting a severe, potentially life-threatening systemic disease: 193 presented one ESSDAI domain classified as high, 14 presented two high scored domains and only one presented three high activity domains."
6130,680,"The ESSDAI domains involved consisted of lymphadenopathy in 78 (37%) cases, CNS in 28 (13%), PNS in 25 (12%), pulmonary in 25 (12%), renal in 21 (10%), cutaneous in 19 (9%), articular in 18 (9%), haematological in 7 (3%) and muscular in 4 (2%)."
6131,680,"Patients with severe systemic disease were more frequently men (p=0.001) and had a higher frequency of anaemia (p<0.001), lymphopenia (p<0.001), rheumatoid factor (p=0.021), low C3 levels (p=0.015), low C4 levels (p<0.001) and cryoglobulins (p<0.001)."
6132,680,"From a therapeutic point of view, systemic patients received more frequently glucocorticoids (p<0.001), immunosuppressants (p<0.001), intravenous immunoglobulins (p=0.008) and rituximab (p<0.001)."
6133,680,"We found an overall mortality rate of 20% in severe systemic patients, a rate that reached to 33% in patients presenting two or more high systemic involvements; these patients had a higher frequency of low C4 levels (p=0.012) and cryoglobulins (p=0.001) in comparison with those with a single severe organ involved."
6134,680,"CONCLUSIONS: 13% of patients with primary SS develop a potentially life-threatening systemic disease (mainly lymphoma, but also severe internal organ involvements including nervous system, the lungs and the kidneys)."
6135,680,This subset of patients requires intensive therapeutic management with a mortality rate of nearly 20% of cases.
6136,681,PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Primary Sjgren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease whose clinical spectrum extends from sicca syndrome to systemic involvement (extraglandular manifestations).
6137,681,Recent reports have focused on expanding the clinical characterization and improving the diagnostic and therapeutic management of systemic Sjgren's.
6138,681,"RECENT FINDINGS: The development of the EULAR-SS disease activity index represents a step forward in the evaluation of systemic Sjgren's, and three multicenter studies including more than 2500 European patients have confirmed that primary Sjgren's syndrome is, undeniably, a systemic autoimmune disease."
6139,681,"Systemic involvement plays a key role in the prognosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome, and recent studies have focused on cutaneous, pulmonary, renal and neurological disease features."
6140,681,Other studies comparing the two sets of Sjgren's syndrome criteria (American College of Rheumatology vs. American-European Consensus Group) in real-life patients found a moderate level of agreement.
6141,681,"Autoantibodies are clues to an early diagnosis, as positivity confirms an autoimmune origin of the sicca syndrome and may appear several years before the disease diagnosis."
6142,681,"In patients with a high clinical suspicion and negative results for the standard determination of anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies, specific detection of anti-Ro52/60 antibodies is recommended."
6143,681,"Direct and indirect B-cell blocking seems to be the most promising biological pathway in primary Sjgren's syndrome, especially for systemic involvement, although a large controlled trial has failed to demonstrate the efficacy of rituximab for nonsystemic symptomatology (dryness, fatigue and pain)."
6144,681,"SUMMARY: Dryness of the mucosal surfaces is the pivotal, but not only, clinical involvement that characterizes primary Sjgren's syndrome."
6145,681,There is growing interest in and knowledge of the clinical characterization and therapeutic management of systemic Sjgren's.
6146,682,"Multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and Behcet disease (BD) are chronic, immune-mediated disorders affecting young adults, the pathogenesis of which is still largely unknown."
6147,682,MS and other demyelinating processes are sometimes difficult to differentiate from the CNS involvement in systemic rheumatic diseases (SRD).
6148,682,"An acute isolated neurological syndrome presents the greatest diagnostic problem, since it is common not only in MS, but can also be the only feature or first manifestation in SLE, APS, SS, and BD."
6149,682,Neurological manifestations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be indistinguishable and no specific diagnostic tools are available.
6150,683,OBJECTIVE: To examine how fatigue may differ from ordinary tiredness in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
6151,683,"METHODS: A purposive, heterogeneous sample of individuals with primary SS who had participated in a study that examined the effects of medication on fatigue was asked to participate in individual interviews."
6152,683,"Patients were asked about their fatigue before and after the onset of illness, changes due to medications, and how fatigue was experienced in daily life."
6153,683,An inductive thematic analysis founded on a social constructionist perspective was performed.
6154,683,RESULTS: Five women and 4 men ages 27-76 years participated.
6155,683,Two themes were identified.
6156,683,"""A heavy, resistant body and ever-present lack of vitality"" represented a profound, ever-present lack of energy along with an unfamiliar bodily heaviness quite different from the experience after alleviation by the drug and being healthy."
6157,683,The patients had scaled down their everyday life in different ways to manage this lack of energy.
6158,683,"""Unpredictable and uncontrollable fluctuations in fatigue"" expressed how the level of fatigue fluctuated from day to day and even within a particular day."
6159,683,The informants tried to portion out their energy without knowing exactly how much energy they would have at any time.
6160,683,"On bad days, patients felt that their ""batteries were flat,"" and they had to put their life on hold."
6161,683,CONCLUSION: Fatigue in primary SS clearly differs from ordinary tiredness.
6162,683,"Patients describe it as an ever-present, fluctuating, and nonrelievable lack of vitality being beyond one's own control."
6163,684,"AIM: Increased serum viscosity is recognized in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS); however, a classic hyperviscosity syndrome (HVS) is rare."
6164,684,We compared the clinical and serological profile among three groups of pSS patients: (i) with HVS; (ii) with high serum viscosity (1.9cP [centipoises]) but without HVS; and (iii) with normal viscosity (<1.9cP).
6165,684,METHODS: We identified four pSS patients with HVS and retrospectively assessed their clinical/serological features.
6166,684,We included as controls 62 pSS patients and registered their clinical features.
6167,684,"We also measured the serum viscosity, C3, C4, immunoglobulins and evaluated the European League Against Rheumatism SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) score at the last visit."
6168,684,"We used (2) , Mann-Whitney U-tests and logistic regression analysis."
6169,684,"RESULTS: Patients were predominantly female (95%), mean age 5414.2years, median disease duration 9years."
6170,684,"All the HVS cases were diagnosed concomitantly with the onset of SS and had higher titers of immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, IgA and a higher prevalence of vasculitis, neutropenia, lymphopenia and splenomegaly."
6171,684,"At the multivariate analysis, the variables vasculitis odds ratio (OR) 14.8 (95% CI 1.3-99, P=0.02) and splenomegaly OR 25.3 (95% CI 1.68-380, P=0.01) remained associated with HSV."
6172,684,Viscosity levels correlated with rheumatoid factor titers.
6173,684,Thirty (48.3%) patients had high viscosity but without HSV; this group had higher median ESSDAI scores and more vasculitis than patients with normal viscosity.
6174,684,CONCLUSION: High viscosity was present in almost half of the patients and was associated with vasculitis and higher activity scores.
6175,684,"Conversely, HVS was infrequent and was associated with vasculitis and splenomegaly."
6176,684,"It seems that both conditions have different physiopathological, clinical and treatment implications."
6177,685,OBJECTIVE: To describe the objectives and methods of the Spanish Society of Rheumatology primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) registry (SJOGREN-SER) METHODS: This is a multicenter descriptive transversal study of a cohort of pSS patients fulfilling European/American consensus criteria collected from Rheumatology clinics all over Spain.
6178,685,Patients were included by randomisation from an anonymised list provided by every department.
6179,685,Data were collected by reviewing clinical records and an interviewing the patients.
6180,685,"Two hundred and ninety eight variables were investigated: epidemiological, clinical, serological characteristics, treatments and complications."
6181,685,Informed consent was obtained and local ethics committees approved the study.
6182,685,"Variables were analysed by descriptive statistical methods, using means, medians, and rates, with their deviations and interquartile ranges (p25-p75)."
6183,685,RESULTS: A total of 3 rheumatology departments participated in the registry.
6184,685,A total of 437 patients were included.
6185,685,"And 95% of them were women, with a median age of 58."
6186,685,Median age at pSS 's diagnosis was 50 years.
6187,685,Dryness symptoms (95%) were the most frequent complaint and anti-Ro/SS-A were present in 94% of the cases.
6188,685,Only 27% of the patients fulfilled the new 2012 SICCA-ACR classification criteria.
6189,685,"CONCLUSIONS: SJOGREN-SER has been designed in order to characterize a representative pSS Spanish cohort, in clinical daily practice, to analyze the magnitude and distribution of its manifestations, activity, accumulated damage and therapeutic management of the disease."
6190,685,This will allow broadening the knowledge of this disease and plan strategies of action in pSS.
6191,686,BACKGROUND: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease that affects the exocrine glands.
6192,686,The absence of early diagnostic markers contributes to delays in its diagnosis.
6193,686,Identification of changes in the protein profile of saliva is considered one of the promising strategies for the discovery of new biomarkers for SS.
6194,686,OBJECTIVE: To identify salivary protein biomarkers with potential for use in discriminating between different lymphoma risk subgroups of SS.
6195,686,"METHOD: Parotid and whole mouth saliva samples were collected from patients with SS, including those in subgroups at higher risk of developing or with confirmed lymphoma, non-SS sicca disease controls and healthy subjects."
6196,686,An initial proteomics analysis by mass spectrometry (LCMSMS) identified S100A8/A9 as a biomarker and was followed by validation with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
6197,686,"RESULTS: Significant differences were found in levels of S100A8/A9 in parotid saliva but not whole mouth saliva between patients with SS compared with healthy and disease control subjects (P=0.001 and 0.031, respectively)."
6198,686,Subgroups of patients with SS based on lymphoma risk showed significant differences in salivary levels of S100A8/A9.
6199,686,"CONCLUSION: The results suggest that salivary levels of S100A8/A9 can aid in differentiating between SS, disease control and healthy control subjects, especially the subgroups of SS with lymphoma or at higher risk of lymphoma."
6200,687,OBJECTIVE: To test the diagnostic accuracy of modified American-European classification criteria (AEC) for primary SS (pSS) by replacing sialoscintigraphy (sSC) with ultrasonography of the major salivary glands.
6201,687,"METHODS: One hundred and ninety subjects were evaluated for the diagnosis of pSS, including US of the salivary glands."
6202,687,We tested the diagnostic accuracy of the three different sets of five diagnostic criteria for pSS.
6203,687,"Each set combined these four criteria (ocular symptoms, oral symptoms, Schirmer-I test and auto-SS-A antibody) and one of the following: US (US set), sSC (sSC set) or biopsy (Biopsy set)."
6204,687,The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of each set of criteria.
6205,687,"RESULTS: Out of 190 subjects examined, 140 subjects fulfilled the AEC for the diagnosis of pSS, whereas 50 subjects were classified as non-pSS subjects."
6206,687,"US score was positive in 129 (92%), sSC in 123 (88%) and biopsy in 93 (66%) of 140 pSS patients."
6207,687,"Among 140 patients with pSS, 88 (63%) patients fulfilled the criteria of the US set, 85 (61%) patients of the sSC set and 71 (51%) patients of the Biopsy set."
6208,687,None of the subjects from the non-pSS group fulfilled any of the sets of criteria.
6209,687,Diagnostic accuracy of each of the three sets of criteria was high and similar [AUC-ROC (s.e.)
6210,687,"for the US set was 0.99 (0.00), followed by the sSC set at 0.98 (0.00) and the Biopsy set at 0.97 (0.00)]."
6211,687,CONCLUSION: US finding of major salivary gland involvement could replace sSC in AEC for the diagnosis of pSS.
6212,688,Order ANA assays only when clinical features suggest a connective tissue disorder.
6213,688,Let ANA immunofluorescent patterns direct additional testing decisions.
6214,689,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjgrens syndrome (pSS) are clinically distinct systemic autoimmune diseases (SADs) that share molecular pathways."
6215,689,We quantified the frequency of circulating immune-cells in 169 patients with these SADs and 44 healty controls (HC) using mass-cytometry and assessed the diagnostic value of these results.
6216,689,Alterations in the frequency of immune-cell subsets were present in all SADs compared to HC.
6217,689,"Most alterations, including a decrease of CD56(hi) NK-cells in SSc and IgM(+) Bcells in pSS, were disease specific; only a reduced frequency of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was common between all SADs Strikingly, hierarchical clustering of SSc patients identified 4 clusters associated with different clinical phenotypes, and 9 of the 12 cell subset-alterations in SSc were also present during the preclinical-phase of the disease."
6218,689,"Additionally, we found a strong association between the use of prednisone and alterations in B-cell subsets."
6219,689,"Although differences in immune-cell frequencies between these SADs are apparent, the discriminative value thereof is too low for diagnostic purposes."
6220,689,"Within each disease, mass cytometry analyses revealed distinct patterns between endophenotypes."
6221,689,"Given the lack of tools enabling early diagnosis of SSc, our results justify further research into the value of cellular phenotyping as a diagnostic aid."
6222,690,Lysozyme amyloidosis (ALys) is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary systemic amyloidosis associated with a large spectrum of clinical manifestations.
6223,690,"ALys phenotype mainly involves the digestive tract, liver and spleen, kidneys, lymph nodes, skin, and lachrymal and salivary glands."
6224,690,"Very recently, cardiac involvement and peripheral neuropathy associated with a new p.Leu102Ser variant of lysozyme have been documented."
6225,690,"In the present observation, we extend the phenotypic heterogeneity of ALys to the tracheobronchial tree with histologically proven bronchial ALys-amyloid deposits."
6226,690,We report the case of a 62-year-old man of Italian origin (Piedmont) diagnosed with ALys associated with the p.Trp82Arg variant.
6227,690,"The patient complained of upper digestive symptoms, sicca syndrome, and lately recurrent pulmonary infections."
6228,690,"Thoracic endoscopy revealed a fragile, inflammatory, and granulomatous aspect of the bronchi."
6229,690,"Amyloid deposits were observed in the upper digestive tract, salivary glands, temporal artery, and tracheobronchial tree."
6230,690,Symptomatic treatment was offered.
6231,690,Recurrent pulmonary infections occurred during the follow-up.
6232,690,Lung involvement in hereditary ALys has only been exceptionally described.
6233,690,"Although vascular involvement has already been reported in ALys in many organs, it never concerned cranial arteries."
6234,690,This case highlights the systemic nature of the amyloid protein variant deposits and expands the spectrum of clinical manifestations to chest involvement.
6235,690,The literature review highlights that hereditary ALys with the p.Trp82Arg variant is frequent in patients coming from Piedmont (Italy).
6236,690,"Due to diffuse organs involvement related to ALys, it is important not to misdiagnose ALys for AL amyloidosis, the most frequent form of amyloidosis."
6237,691,Background.
6238,691,Our study aimed to investigate whether the introduction of automated anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) analysis decreases the interlaboratory variability of ANA titer results.
6239,691,Method.
6240,691,Three serum samples were sent to 10 laboratories using the QUANTA-Lyser in combination with the NOVA View.
6241,691,Each laboratory performed the ANA IIF analysis 10x in 1 run and 1x in 10 different runs and determined the endpoint titer by dilution.
6242,691,"One of the three samples had been sent in 2012, before the era of ANA IIF automation, by the Belgian National External Quality Assessment (EQA) Scheme."
6243,691,Harmonization was evaluated in terms of variability in fluorescence intensity (LIU) and ANA IIF titer.
6244,691,Results.
6245,691,"The evaluation of the intra- and interrun LIU variability revealed a larger variability for 2 laboratories, due to preanalytical and analytical problems."
6246,691,Reanalysis of the EQA sample resulted in a lower titer variability.
6247,691,Diluted endpoint titers were similar to the estimated single well titer and the overall median titer as reported by the EQA in 2012.
6248,691,Conclusion.
6249,691,"The introduction of automated microscopic analysis allows more harmonized ANA IIF reporting, provided that this totally automated process is controlled by a thorough quality assurance program, covering the total ANA IIF process."
6250,692,We report an autopsy case of a patient with Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) who presented with rapid progressive pulmonary fibrosis following the onset of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) without cryoglobulinemia.
6251,692,"Despite early and aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, pulmonary fibrosis progressed and the patient succumbed to his illness."
6252,692,An autopsy was performed and revealed DAH and interstitial pneumonia with a fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia pattern.
6253,692,We could not find any previously-reported underlying causes of DAH.
6254,692,The findings from this case suggest that DAH can occur as a pulmonary manifestation of SjS as well as other connective tissue diseases or vasculitis.
6255,693,"OBJECTIVE: To perform a cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort - Sicca Symptoms Inventory (short form) (PROFAD-SSI-SF) questionnaire assessing the subjective aspects of the symptoms of primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS), for the Brazilian Portuguese language."
6256,693,"METHOD: Conceptual, of the item, semantic and operational equivalences were evaluated."
6257,693,The Brazilian version of PROFAD-SSI-SF was administered to 62 women with pSS according to the European-American consensus 2002 to assess measurement equivalence.
6258,693,"-Cronbach was used for internal consistency; intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for intraobserver reproducibility; and Spearman correlation coefficient for validity by comparing with Patient Global Assessment (PaGA), EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Subscale (FACIT-F) and EuroQOL (EQ-5D)."
6259,693,"RESULTS: The internal consistency of PROFAD, SSI and total score was 0.80; 0.78; and 0.87, respectively."
6260,693,The intraobserver reproducibility of total PROFAD was 0.89; of total SSI of 0.86; and total score of 0.89.
6261,693,"In terms of validity, PROFAD correlated significantly with PaGA (r = 0.50), FACIT-F (r = 0.59), ESSPRI (r = 0.58) and all domains of EQ-5D, with the exception of Mobility."
6262,693,"On the other hand, SSI correlated significantly with PaGA (r = 0.43), FACIT-F (r = 0.57), ESSPRI (r = 0.55) and most areas of EQ-5D."
6263,693,The total score of PROFAD-SSI-SF had a non-statistically significant correlation only with Mobility domain and with 1-100 range of EQ-5D.
6264,693,"CONCLUSION: The Portuguese version of PROFAD-SSI-SF proved to be an adaptable, reproducible and valid tool for the Brazilian Portuguese language."
6265,694,Interstitial nephritis and immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis are the two common renal manifestations of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
6266,694,"Here, we discuss three cases of primary SS where presenting manifestation was distal renal tubular acidosis."
6267,694,The possibility of an underlying autoimmune disorder should be considered in a patient presenting with distal tubular acidosis or recurrent hypokalemic periodic paralysis as treatment of primary disease improves the outcome of illness.
6268,695,BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe a case series of 13 Hispanic patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) and biopsy-proven renal involvement.
6269,695,"METHODS: We describe the clinical, serological and histological characteristics as well as the prognosis in a group of patients with pSS and biopsy-proven renal involvement, treated in 2 referral nephrology units in Mexico City."
6270,695,RESULTS: Thirteen patients with pSS underwent kidney biopsy (KB) over a period of 27 years.
6271,695,The median duration from pSS diagnosis to KB was 13.9 months.
6272,695,Seven patients (54%) had glomerulonephritis and 6 patients (46%) had tubulointerstitial nephritis.
6273,695,All patients were treated with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants.
6274,695,Eight patients (62%) remained stable or their renal function improved after a median follow-up of 12 months.
6275,695,CONCLUSIONS: This case series reflects the broad spectrum of renal involvement in pSS.
6276,695,"We observed that in our Hispanic population, glomerular involvement was the most frequent abnormality, mainly membranous glomerulopathy, followed by tubulointerstitial disease."
6277,695,Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis were also common biopsy findings.
6278,695,Treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents appear to slow renal disease progression.
6279,696,The formation of lymphomononuclear cell infiltrates organising as periductal infiltrates in the salivary glands of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is one of the hallmarks of the disease.
6280,696,"Historically, the clinical role of salivary gland histopathology, most commonly performed on labial salivary gland biopsies, has been confined to the clinical classification and diagnosis of pSS whereby according to the ACR-EULAR a positive histopathology finding is a requirement for the diagnosis of pSS in the absence of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies."
6281,696,"In recent years, further understanding of the heterogeneity of the immune cell infiltration and organisation within the salivary glands of pSS patients and its correlation with clinical manifestations of the disease has led to propose salivary gland histopathology as a novel tool able to identify patients at higher risk of developing more severe extraglandular manifestations and lymphoma."
6282,696,"Furthermore, recent clinical developments in ongoing randomised clinical trials with novel biologics in pSS have focused on salivary glands histopathology to inform on patients stratification based on target validation, proof of drug efficacy and mechanisms of response/resistance to therapy."
6283,696,"However, lack of standardisation of methodology and analysis has hindered the reproducibility of data from different groups and no definitive evidence in support of the use of salivary glands histopathology to inform clinical management of patients with pSS has been provided."
6284,696,"In this review, we summarise recent evidence highlighting the promises and pitfalls of salivary glands histopathology in pSS emphasising the need for an international consensus on standardisation of methodology with validation in large prospective multicentre initiatives."
6285,697,Background Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune connective tissue disease affecting the body's moisture-producing glands.
6286,697,"Some studies have linked SS to adverse maternal/neonatal outcomes, but sample sizes have tended to be small, with few outcomes examined."
6287,697,The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of SS on pregnancy outcomes for mother and neonate using a large dataset.
6288,697,Methods We carried out a retrospective cohort study of women who delivered between 1999 and 2014 using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the United States.
6289,697,SS categorization is based on ICD-9 coding.
6290,697,Baseline characteristics were compared in both groups and multivariate logistic regression was used to compare maternal and fetal outcomes of pregnancies in women with and without SS.
6291,697,"Results The prevalence of SS in our population was 1.34 cases/10,000 births, with the rate increasing over the study period."
6292,697,"Women with SS tended to be older, Caucasian and to have pre-existing comorbidities."
6293,697,"Births to women with SS were at greater risk of pre-eclampsia [odds ratio (OR) 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34-1.99]; premature rupture of membranes (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.57); preterm delivery (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.34-1.81); cesarean delivery (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17-1.41); and venous thromboembolic events (OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.57-5.35)."
6294,697,"Infants of women with SS were more likely to have intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (OR 3.00, 95% CI 2.46-3.65); and congenital malformations (OR 3.26, 95% CI 2.30-4.62)."
6295,697,Conclusion SS is a high-risk pregnancy condition associated with significant comorbidities and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.
6296,697,Women with SS may benefit from increased surveillance during their pregnancies.
6297,698,This study investigated the relationship between clinical severity and percentage of conjunctival antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in Sjgren's syndrome (SS)-associated keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS).
6298,698,"KCS clinical severity was based on symptom severity, tear volume, tear break-up time, and ocular surface dye staining."
6299,698,Conjunctival goblet cell density (GCD) was measured in periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-stained membranes.
6300,698,Conjunctival cells obtained by impression cytology were used for flow cytometry to measure percentages of CD45HLA-DR APCs and mature CD11cCD86 dendritic cells (DCs).
6301,698,"Compared to normal conjunctiva, the percentages of HLA-DR and CD11cCD86 cells were higher in the conjunctiva of the KCS group (p < 0.05)."
6302,698,"The percentage of CD45HLA-DR cells positively correlated with clinical severity (r = 0.71, p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with GCD (r = -0.61, p < 0.05)."
6303,698,"Clinical severity also negatively correlated with GCD (r = -0.54, p < 0.05)."
6304,698,These findings indicate that a higher percentage of APCs and mature DCs in the conjunctiva is associated with more severe KCS in SS.
6305,698,These APCs may contribute to the generation of the pathogenic Th1 cells that cause goblet cell loss in KCS.
6306,699,The rationale for B cell depletion therapy with rituximab in primary Sjgren's syndrome relies upon the well-established role of B cell hyperactivity in immunopathogenesis.
6307,699,"In line with this notion, several biomarkers of B cell activity are significantly affected by treatment, both in the target organs and periphery."
6308,699,"In contrast to most biological outcomes, clinical outcomes are not consistent between studies."
6309,699,"Although two large RCTs did not meet their primary endpoint, several beneficial clinical effects of treatment have been shown."
6310,699,"As discussed in this review, differences in study design and patient characteristics could explain the variation in results."
6311,699,"Interestingly, a newly developed composite endpoint of subjective and objective outcomes did show a significant effect of rituximab in one of the large RCTs."
6312,699,Response predictors need to be identified to define more targeted inclusion criteria and achieve precision medicine.
6313,699,The positive effects seen on biological and clinical parameters warrant future studies to investigate this promising treatment modality.
6314,700,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that typically affects the salivary and lacrimal glands.
6315,700,Renal involvement is relatively uncommon and may precede other complaints.
6316,700,Tubulointestitial nephritis (TIN) is the most common renal involvement in SS.
6317,700,Osteomalacia occurring as the first manifestation of renal tubular disorder due to SS is very rare.
6318,700,"We report a 39-year-old male who presented with polydipsia, polyuria, and multiple bone pain."
6319,700,"Bone density test showed severe osteoporosis, and laboratory findings suggested hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and vitamin D deficiency, which supported the diagnosis of hypophosphatemic osteomalacia."
6320,700,"He had nephrogenic loss of phosphate and potassium, tubular acidification, and concentration dysfunction."
6321,700,"And, the diagnosis of chronic TIN was subsequently confirmed by renal biopsy."
6322,700,The patient reported dry mouth and physical examination showed multiple dental caries.
6323,700,"Xerophthalmia, abnormal morphology, and function of the salivary glands by sonography and scintigraphy, together with positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB, confirmed the diagnosis of SS."
6324,700,The TIN indicated SS as the underlying cause of osteomalacia.
6325,700,"After taking supplements of potassium, phosphate, vitamin D, and sodium bicarbonate for 1month, bone pain was alleviated and serological potassium and phosphorus were also back to normal."
6326,700,"In conclusion, renal involvement in SS may be latent and precede the typical sicca symptoms."
6327,700,Osteomalacia can be the first manifestation of renal disorder due to SS.
6328,700,"Therefore, autoantibody investigations as well as the lacrimal and salivary gland examinations for SS should be considered and performed for suspected patients."
6329,701,OBJECTIVE: To investigate distinct features of renal involvement in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and to identify potential factors associated with renal involvement.
6330,701,METHODS: Four hundred and thrity-four pSS patients from the Rheumatology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from 2013 to 2017 were included in a cross-sectional study.
6331,701,Patients with renal involvement were compared with their age- and gender-matched controls (pSS without renal involvement).
6332,701,"Demographic, clinical, histological, nephritic, immunological features of renal involvement in pSS were systematically analyzed."
6333,701,Possible factors related to renal involvement were identified using multivariate logistic regression analyses.
6334,701,RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-two pSS patients (88.48%) with renal involvement were women with mean age of nearly 58years and mean disease duration of above 4years.
6335,701,"Clinical manifestation, serologic and immunological features and renal biopsy class of the pSS patients with renal involvement were presented."
6336,701,"By multivariate analyses, xerophthalmia, histological positivity for lower salivary gland biopsy (LSGB), anti-SSA/Ro52-positive, reduced complement 3 (C3) levels, hypoalbuminemia and anemia retained significant association with renal involvement in pSS (all P<0.05)."
6337,701,"CONCLUSION: In addition to LSGB pattern, anti-SSA/Ro52-positivity, reduced C3 levels, hypoalbuminemia and anemia, also indicate significant association with renal involvement in pSS."
6338,701,"Therefore, early vigilance is required for patients with these clinical manifestations."
6339,702,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and the newly proposed American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for Sjgren's Syndrome (SS) in a well-characterised sicca cohort, given ongoing efforts to resolve discrepancies and weaknesses in the systems."
6340,702,"METHODS: In a multidisciplinary clinic for the evaluation of sicca, we assessed features of salivary and lacrimal gland dysfunction and autoimmunity as defined by tests of both AECG and ACR criteria in 646 participants."
6341,702,Global gene expression profiles were compared in a subset of 180 participants.
6342,702,"RESULTS: Application of the AECG and ACR criteria resulted in classification of 279 and 268 participants with SS, respectively."
6343,702,Both criteria were met by 244 participants (81%).
6344,702,"In 26 of the 35 AECG+/ACR participants, the minor salivary gland biopsy focal score was 1 (74%), while nine had positive anti-Ro/La (26%)."
6345,702,There were 24 AECG-/ACR+ who met ACR criteria mainly due to differences in the scoring of corneal staining.
6346,702,"All patients with SS, regardless of classification, had similar gene expression profiles, which were distinct from the healthy controls."
6347,702,CONCLUSIONS: The two sets of classification criteria yield concordant results in the majority of cases and gene expression profiling suggests that patients meeting either set of criteria are more similar to other SS participants than to healthy controls.
6348,702,"Thus, there is no clear evidence for increased value of the new ACR criteria over the old AECG criteria from the clinical or biological perspective."
6349,702,"It is our contention, supported by this report, that improvements in diagnostic acumen will require a more fundamental understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms than is at present available."
6350,703,T cell large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia is a rare condition accounting for 2-3% of all mature lymphoid leukemias.
6351,703,"Here, we present the case of a 73-year-old woman presenting with neutropenia and anemia (hemoglobin 9.9 g/dl)."
6352,703,Hematological assessment revealed the presence of a T cell LGL leukemia.
6353,703,"At the time of T cell LGL leukemia diagnosis, the patient developed xerophthalmia and xerostomia, and a diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome was made following salivary gland biopsy."
6354,703,"The finding of large granular lymphocytes in the context of autoimmune disorders is well-known, though it often occurs with rheumatoid arthritis or in association with a positive autoantibody titer in the absence of an overt clinical picture."
6355,703,The concomitant presentation of T cell LGL leukemia with Sjgren's syndrome is a rare event which is worth reporting.
6356,703,Our patient was managed with immunosuppressive therapy and is still alive.
6357,704,BACKGROUND: The exact frequency of distal and proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) in Sjgren's syndrome is unknown.
6358,704,"Other features of Sjgren's syndrome like polyuria, glomerular manifestations, familial occurrence and pregnancy are not widely reported."
6359,704,The aim was to prospectively study the clinical features and outcome of distal and proximal RTA in Sjgren's syndrome and also report on other renal manifestations of Sjgren's syndrome.
6360,704,METHODS: The present study is a prospective consecutive case series of patients who presented with a history suggestive of RTA and Sjgren's syndrome.
6361,704,All patients were followed for 1 year.
6362,704,The diagnosis of RTA was by fractional excretion of bicarbonate.
6363,704,The diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome was according to the American-European classification system [modified by Tzioufas and Voulgarelis: Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol 2007;21:989-1010].
6364,704,RESULTS: The total number of RTA patients diagnosed during this period was 149.
6365,704,Sjgren's syndrome accounted for 34.8% (52 of 149) of RTA patients.
6366,704,"The important symptoms and laboratory parameters were oral and ocular symptoms in 23 (44.2%), dental caries in 12 (23%), body pains in 47 (90.3%), mean serum pH 7.202  0.03, mean serum bicarbonate, 14.03  1.66 mmol/l, and mean urine pH, 7.125  0.54."
6367,704,There were 30 (57.6%) patients with distal RTA and 22 (42.3%) patients with proximal RTA.
6368,704,CONCLUSIONS: The clinical implication of the present study is that RTA is a common feature of Sjgren's syndrome.
6369,704,It may be missed if the presentation is not due to oral and ocular symptoms.
6370,704,The present study is also the only one with a 1-year follow-up.
6371,705,"OBJECTIVES: In the absence of previous studies, our objective was to assess whether gout was associated with an increase or decrease in the risk of Sjogren's Syndrome (SS) in older adults, 65 years or older."
6372,705,METHODS: We used the 5% Medicare claims from 2006-2012.
6373,705,"A multivariable Cox regression model assessed the association of gout with incident SS adjusting for age, sex, race, Charlson-Romano comorbidity index, and the use of medications for cardiovascular diseases (statins, beta-blockers, diuretics, ACE-inhibitors) and gout (allopurinol, febuxostat)."
6374,705,Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
6375,705,"RESULTS: There were 3,186 new cases of SS in the study cohort with crude incidence rates of SS of 30/100,000 person-years in patients without gout and 49/100,000 person-years in patients with gout."
6376,705,"Multivariable-adjusted analyses showed that gout was independently associated with a higher hazard ratio of SS of 1.73 (95% CI, 1.45, 2.06)."
6377,705,"Sensitivity analyses that substituted continuous Charlson-Romano comorbidity index score with categorized score (model 2) or individual comorbidities plus three common cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease; model 3), confirmed the main study findings with minimal attenuation of hazard ratio, 1.70 (95% CI, 1.43, 2.02) and 1.48 (95% CI, 1.25, 1.77), respectively."
6378,705,"Younger age, female sex, White race and higher comorbidity score were associated with a higher hazard of SS."
6379,705,CONCLUSIONS: Gout was associated with more than 1.7-fold higher risk of incident SS in adults 65 years or older.
6380,705,This finding needs to be reproduced and the underlying mechanisms for this association need further study.
6381,706,INTRODUCTION: We compared histological and clinical profiles of primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) small fiber neuropathy (SFN; pSS-SFN) with idiopathic SFN (i-SFN) and hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis SFN (hATTR-SFN) and described the evolution of pSS-SFN.
6382,706,"METHODS: All patients with pSS-SFN, i-SFN, and hATTR-SFN confirmed by reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density on skin biopsy were retrospectively included, and their characteristics were compared."
6383,706,"To analyze prognosis of pSS-SFN, patients prospectively underwent a second evaluation."
6384,706,"RESULTS: Fifteen pSS-SFN, 17 hATTR-SFN, and 11 i-SFN were included."
6385,706,Time to diagnosis SFN was longer in pSS-SFN and i-SFN than in hATTR-SFN.
6386,706,Painful and non-length-dependent patterns were more frequent in pSS-SFN than in hATTR-SFN.
6387,706,Twelve (80%) patients with pSS-SFN had a non-length-dependent pattern.
6388,706,Ten patients with pSS were reassessed after 3.1years (1.7-4.7); none developed large fiber neuropathy linked to pSS.
6389,706,DISCUSSION: Primary Sjgren syndrome SFN is characterized by a more frequent non-length-dependent pattern compared with i-SFN and hATTR-SFN.
6390,706,Primary Sjgren syndrome SFN did not evolve through large fiber neuropathy.
6391,707,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by focal lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands causing dry eyes and dry mouth.
6392,707,"Similar glandular features can also occur as a late complication in patients with other rheumatic disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and scleroderma ('secondary' Sjgren's syndrome)."
6393,707,"(1) Anti-Ro and/or anti-La (ENA) antibodies are found in approximately 70% of pSS patients, generally with ANA positivity."
6394,707,Hypergammaglobulinaemia is also common.
6395,707,Systemic features also occur in some patients with pSS.
6396,707,"A positive rheumatoid factor (RF) is often seen and so if patients present with arthritis, dryness and a positive RF a diagnosis of pSS should be considered as a possible alternative to RA."
6397,707,Anti-CCP antibodies are more specific for RA.
6398,708,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether major salivary-gland ultrasonography (SGUS) abnormalities change over time in patients with suspected primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) during the natural course of the disease.
6399,708,"METHODS: We studied patients with suspected pSS who were included in the Brittany cohort of suspected pSS and underwent SGUS at least twice, as part of the routine diagnostic workup done at baseline then at least 1 year later as an additional investigation deemed appropriate by the physician."
6400,708,"The evaluation criteria were the semi-quantitative SGUS score (0-4) for each parotid and submandibular gland, the highest SGUS score among the four glands, and the sum of SGUS scores for the four glands."
6401,708,"These scores were compared in patients with and without pSS according to the workup at baseline, and their changes over time were assessed."
6402,708,"RESULTS: Of 49 included patients, 29 received a diagnosis of pSS at baseline; none of the remaining 20 patients was diagnosed with pSS at either evaluation."
6403,708,The mean (SD) sum of SGUS scores at baseline was 8.9 (5.6) in patients with and 2.1 (2.9) in those without pSS (P<0.01).
6404,708,Mean time between SGUSs was 1.9 (1.6) years.
6405,708,"None of the evaluation criteria changed between the two SGUSs in the overall population, pSS group, or group without pSS."
6406,708,Similar results were found in the subgroup with recent-onset symptoms.
6407,708,CONCLUSION: SGUS abnormalities assessed using a semi-quantitative score did not change significantly during a follow-up of nearly 2 years after an initial evaluation for suspected pSS.
6408,709,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare clinical and laboratory features of patients who, while satisfying the American European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria for primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS), do not present the positivity for anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB, with patients that meet the AECG criteria and are positive for anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB."
6409,709,"METHODS: 548 patients were selected based on the following criteria, and exclusion of patients negative for histopathology but positive for anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB: 1."
6410,709,"Fulfilment of the AECG criteria, 2."
6411,709,"Performance of minor salivary gland biopsy, 3."
6412,709,"Search for anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB, 4."
6413,709,Absence of hepatitis C virus infection.
6414,709,Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.
6415,709,"RESULTS: Two groups were compared: 342 patients were positive for both the histopathology and for anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB (H-only) and 206 patients were positive for histopathology, but negative for autoantibodies (H+SSA/SSB)."
6416,709,"The following variables were statistically found to be associated with H+SSA/SSB: younger age at diagnosis (p<0.0001), glandular swelling (p=0.01), purpura (p=0.04), leucopoenia (p=0.0001), lymphoma (p=0.002), low C3 (p=0.04), low C4 (p=0.01), hypergammaglobulinemia (p<0.0001), ANA (p<0.0001), rheumatoid factor (p<0.0001), and serum cryoglobulins (p=0.039)."
6417,709,"ANA positivity (OR 6.9), hypergammaglobulinemia (OR 5.1), positive rheumatoid factor (OR 2.3), and age at diagnosis (OR 0.97) were also selected by multivariate analyses as associated with H+SSA/SSB."
6418,709,CONCLUSION: Primary SS negative for anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies appears to be characterized by a lower risk of lymphoma and by a lower level of B-cell expansion.
6419,710,Oral signs are frequently the first manifestation of autoimmune diseases.
6420,710,"For this reason, dentists play an important role in the detection of emerging autoimmune pathologies."
6421,710,"Indeed, an early diagnosis can play a decisive role in improving the quality of treatment strategies as well as quality of life."
6422,710,This can be obtained thanks to specific knowledge of oral manifestations of autoimmune diseases.
6423,710,"This review is aimed at describing oral presentations, diagnosis, and treatment strategies for systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjgren syndrome, pemphigus vulgaris, mucous membrane pemphigoid, and Behcet disease."
6424,711,"OBJECTIVE: The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are increased in various inflammation related diseases, but their clinical significance in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) has not been reported."
6425,711,The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical significance of RDW and NLR in pSS patients.
6426,711,METHODS: The medical records of pSS patients who were admitted to Changhai Hospital of the Second Military Medical University between April 2012 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed.
6427,711,"Correlations between RDW, NLR and the patient clinical characteristics were analyzed using the Spearman approach and the multiple linear regression model."
6428,711,RESULTS: Fifty-two pSS patients and 58 healthy controls were enrolled.
6429,711,RDW and NLR were increased in pSS patients and positively correlated with the Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (SSDAI).
6430,711,CONCLUSION: RDW and NLR may prove to be useful indices to estimate pSS disease activity.
6431,712,Sjgren syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic inflammation of exocrine glands and a variety of extraglandular sites.
6432,712,Lung involvement as defined by symptoms and either pulmonary function testing or radiographic abnormalities occurs in approximately 10 to 20% of patients.
6433,712,Subclinical lung disease is even more frequent and often includes evidence of small airways disease and airway inflammation.
6434,712,"In general, patients will have evidence of both airway and interstitial lung disease by radiographs and pathology."
6435,712,"Bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis are the most common airway manifestations while the interstitial pathologies associated with SS include nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, usual interstitial pneumonitis, and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis."
6436,712,Patients with SS are also at an increased risk of lymphoma.
6437,712,"A protean of other lung abnormalities including amyloidosis, granulomatous lung disease, pseudolymphoma, pulmonary hypertension, and pleural disease have been described."
6438,713,"PURPOSE: To determine whether signs and symptoms of ocular surface disease improve after placement of a self-retained, cryopreserved amniotic membrane (CAM) in patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS)."
6439,713,"METHODS: The medical records of SS patients who received a self-retained CAM implant (Prokera or Prokera Slim; TissueTech Inc, Doral, FL) for the treatment of ocular surface disease between August 2012 and August 2016 at a single, large academic institution were reviewed retrospectively."
6440,713,"Visual acuity, results of slit-lamp examination of the cornea and conjunctiva, and dry eye symptoms, were evaluated before and after CAM insertion."
6441,713,"RESULTS: A total of 6 eyes of 6 patients (all female; mean age, 62.5  13.0 years [range, 49-86 years]) were included."
6442,713,All patients were on topical medications at the time of the study and had signs of ocular surface dryness.
6443,713,There were reductions in corneal and/or conjunctival staining in 5 eyes (83%) after the CAM dissolved.
6444,713,"All patients who completed therapy (5/5) experienced a relapse in their signs and symptoms within 1 month of removal of the CAM, with an average time to relapse of 24.6 days."
6445,713,Mean follow-up time was 54.5 days.
6446,713,Foreign body sensation and blurred vision were the most common complaints associated with the CAM implant.
6447,713,"CONCLUSIONS: In this small case series, self-retained CAM implantation was found to be beneficial in SS patients with ocular surface disease that is refractory to standard therapies; however, we found that the effects were temporary."
6448,713,Future larger studies are needed to confirm these benefits.
6449,714,"OBJECTIVES: To detect HTLV-I bZIP factor (HBZ), tax and relevant molecules in labial salivary glands (LSGs) from patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
6450,714,METHODS: The expressions of HBZ and tax in T cell lines and LSGs were analysed by in situ hybridization (ISH) or real time PCR.
6451,714,The expressions of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) and p65 in immunohistochemistry were quantified.
6452,714,"RESULTS: After specificity of ISH probes was determined in 5 T cell lines, in LSGs from an adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patient and 3 HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM)-SS patients, both HBZ and tax signals were detected in infiltrating mononuclear cells (MNCs) and ducts, and HBZ and tax were dominantly expressed in MNCs of ATL and HAM-SS, respectively."
6453,714,HBZ was dominantly observed in LSGs from 8 HTLV-I asymptomatic carrier (AC)-SS patients; faint expression of HBZ was observed in LSGs from 5 HTLV-I-seronegative SS patients.
6454,714,No cell adhesion molecule 1(CADM1) expressed in LSGs from the ATL patient.
6455,714,"Although Foxp3 expression was observed in LSG MNCs of all of the SS patients, the ATL patient's expression was significantly greater than that of the AC-SS (p<0.01) and HTLV-I-seronegative SS (p<0.01) patients."
6456,714,"The Foxp3 expression was similar in ATL and HAMSS, but significantly higher in HAM-SS than AC-SS (p<0.05)."
6457,714,p65 was expressed in LSG MNC nuclei from all SS patients and co-expressed with Foxp3.
6458,714,The expressions of Foxp3 in ducts differed according to HTLV-I infection.
6459,714,CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that HBZ-mediated Foxp3 expression is partly associated with the pathogenesis of HTLV-I-seropositive SS.
6460,715,"INTRODUCTION: The rheumatoid factor (RF) is present in numerous autoimmune disorders, although its role in many of them remains a subject of research."
6461,715,The study assesses the role of RF as an immunological and prognostic factor in the primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
6462,715,"METHODS: Seventy-five pSS patients (mean age 50.0315.1), 65 (87%) females, and 10 (13%) males."
6463,715,"WBC, CRP, RF, ESR, gammaglobulins, C4, C3 component of complement, cryoglobulins, ANA, anti-SS-A, and anti-SS-B antibodies were determined."
6464,715,The disease activity assessed with ESSDAI.
6465,715,Minor salivary gland biopsy (focus score and immunochemistry) was conducted.
6466,715,"Results were analyzed with U Mann-Whitney (continuous variables) tests, correlations between quantitative variables assessed with the Spearman correlation coefficient with statistical significance set at p<0.05."
6467,715,The approval of the Bioethics Committee was obtained.
6468,715,"RESULTS: Two subgroups I-RF(+) (61%) and II-RF(-) (39%) were established, with lower WBC (p=0.012) and higher ESR (p=0.016), gammaglobulin concentration (p=0.007) in group I. Conjunctivitis sicca was more severe in group I."
6469,715,"There was positive correlation between RF and lnANA (rho =0.496), anti-SS-A, anti-SS-B antibodies (rho =0.448; rho =0.397 respectively)."
6470,715,"There was higher disease activity ESSDAI in group I than in group II (Me, 3.0 vs 2.0; p<0.003)."
6471,715,RF correlated negatively with WBC (rho =-0.374).
6472,715,"RF did not correlate with serum concentrations of BAFF, APRIL, CRP, and C3, C4 and with CD19+, CD3+, CD4+, CD 21+, and CD35+."
6473,715,"CONCLUSIONS: RF should be considered as a prognostic, but not diagnostic, factor in patients with pSS, as it is associated with more severe disease course (sicca eye symptoms, ESSDAI) and parameters (production of gammaglobulins, ANA, anti SS-A, anti-SS-B autoantibodies) indicating increased B cell activity."
6474,716,"Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that has several oral manifestations, with reduced salivary flow being the most prevalent."
6475,716,"As a result of the dry mouth and irritated oral tissues, dental treatment may be challenging."
6476,716,"In particular, a patient's satisfaction with removable prosthesis may be limited."
6477,716,This case report and the literature review discuss the feasibility of implant-supported dental prostheses.
6478,716,The clinical and functional advantages provided by implant prostheses might outweigh the slightly lower overall implant success rate in SS patients.
6479,716,The impacts of SS on dental treatment are summarized in this review.
6480,717,AIM: To describe baseline characteristics of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) with right heart catheterization (RHC)-confirmed pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and explore risk factors for PAH in pSS.
6481,717,"METHODS: This case-control study included consecutive patients hospitalized with pSS-PAH from 2007 to 2015, and pSS patients without PAH (in a 4 : 1 ratio) as controls."
6482,717,All patients fulfilled the 2002 American-European Consensus Group classification criteria for pSS-PAH was defined according to RHC-based European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines.
6483,717,Associated variables were analyzed by univariate binary logistic regression to identify possible risk factors for PAH.
6484,717,"RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with RHC-confirmed pSS-PAH were included (mean age at onset, 38.4  8.3 years; mean pSS duration, 54.6 months)."
6485,717,"PAH was the initial manifestation of pSS in 12 patients (41.4%), and shortness of breath was the most common symptom (29/29, 100%)."
6486,717,"Mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 51.8  10.0 mmHg, mean cardiac index was 2.3  0.8 L/min/m(2) , and mean pulmonary vascular resistance was 13.0  6.0 Wood units in this group."
6487,717,Treatments included immunosuppressive agents (93.1%) and PAH-targeted therapies (86.2%).
6488,717,"We identified four independent risk factors for PAH in pSS: Raynaud's phenomenon (odds ratio [OR] = 9.660, P = 0.000), rheumatoid factor  200 U/mL (OR = 6.691, P = 0.001), hepatic injury (OR = 3.284, P = 0.008) and pericardial effusion (OR = 3.279, P = 0.016)."
6489,717,CONCLUSIONS: PAH can be the first manifestation of pSS.
6490,717,"The pSS patients with Raynaud's phenomenon, high-titer rheumatoid factor, hepatic injury or pericardial effusion should be screened for PAH."
6491,718,PURPOSE: To investigate parameters of ocular surface disease in C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 (Aec) mice with aging and their correlation with development of Sjgren syndrome (SS)-like lacrimal gland (LG) disease.
6492,718,"METHODS: Aec and C57BL/6 wild-type (B6) female mice were evaluated at 4, 12, and 20 weeks of age."
6493,718,Whole LG and eyes and adnexa were excised for histology and gene expression analysis and evaluated by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry.
6494,718,Tear volume and goblet cell density was measured.
6495,718,Quantitative PCR evaluated T-cell-related cytokine expression in cornea and conjunctiva.
6496,718,RESULTS: Both strains showed age-related conjunctival goblet cell loss that was more pronounced in the Aec strain and significantly greater than in B6 mice at 12 weeks.
6497,718,This was accompanied by CD4+ T-cell infiltration of the conjunctiva that was greater in Aec strain at 20 weeks.
6498,718,"Aec mice had higher levels of IL-17A, IL-17R, IL-1, IL-1, and TNF- in the conjunctiva, and they significantly increase with aging."
6499,718,Aec mice had greater lymphocytic infiltration of the LG and conjunctiva at 20 weeks that consisted of a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ cells.
6500,718,Flow cytometry showed a significant increase in CD4+ T cells in Aec LG compared to B6 mice.
6501,718,Tear volume was significantly increased in both strains at 20 weeks.
6502,718,CONCLUSIONS: Aec mice developed greater conjunctival goblet cell loss associated with lymphocytic infiltration of the LG and conjunctiva with aging.
6503,718,Increased expression of certain T helper or inflammatory cytokines in these tissues was observed in Aec mice.
6504,718,The conjunctival disease appeared to be due to inflammation and not a decrease in tear volume.
6505,719,PURPOSE: The present study was aimed to clinically evaluate transitional treatment of pulpitis during pregnancy.
6506,719,"METHODS: Sixty pregnant women with pulpitis were divided into the first, second and third trimester."
6507,719,They were anesthetized locally using STA system combined with psychological intervention during treatment.
6508,719,The teeth were given one-appointment root canal preparation and filled with vitapex pasta.
6509,719,Normal obturation of the root canal was conducted after delivery.
6510,719,"The effects of dental treatment, pregnancy outcomes and neonatal health status were observed."
6511,719,"Data of the survey were analyzed by SPSS 20.0 software package, including Student's t test and chi-square test."
6512,719,"RESULTS: The symptoms of pulpitis were significantly improved 24h after treatment,and the effective rate was 96.7%."
6513,719,The difference of VAS before and after treatment was statistically significant (P<0.05).
6514,719,"Patients had no discomfort till the end of pregnancy,and the success rate was 98.3%."
6515,719,No adverse pregnancy outcomes were observed after treatment during different periods of pregnancy.
6516,719,Neonatal health was good.
6517,719,"Significant differences were not found in birth gestational age, body weight, malformations, and neonatal complications between three treatment periods (P>0.05)."
6518,719,CONCLUSIONS: Transitional treatment of pulpitis during pregnancy is a safe and effective procedure and worthy of wide use clinically.
6519,720,A 49-year-old woman with primary Sjgren syndrome initially developed pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH) due to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
6520,720,Endomyocardial biopsy specimens showed mild myocardial fibrosis.
6521,720,Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was revealed after the treatment with diuretics.
6522,720,"During the treatment for PAH using upfront combination with pulmonary vasodilators and immunosuppressants, the patient developed combined disease with PAH and PVH."
6523,720,A careful hemodynamic assessment is necessary in such cases.
6524,721,The activated NF-B signaling pathway plays an important role in pathogenesis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
6525,721,"The inhibitor of B (IB) kinase (IKK) family such as IKK, IKK, IKK, and IKK, is required for this signaling."
6526,721,Our aim was to investigate the role of IKK/// in patients with untreated pSS.
6527,721,"In minor salivary glands from pSS patients, phosphorylated IKK (pIKK), pIB, and pNF-B p65 (p-p65) were highly expressed in ductal epithelium and infiltrating mononuclear cells by immunohistochemistry, compared to healthy individuals."
6528,721,pIKK/ and pIKK were both negative.
6529,721,And pIKK positively related to expression of p-p65.
6530,721,"Furthermore, pIKK and p-p65 expression significantly correlated with biopsy focus score and overall disease activity."
6531,721,"Meanwhile, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from pSS patients, pIKK, total IKK, pIKK/, and p-p65 were significantly increased by western blot, compared to healthy controls."
6532,721,"However, there was no difference in IKK and IB between pSS patients and healthy individuals."
6533,721,"These results demonstrated an abnormality of IKK, IB, and NF-B in pSS, suggesting a potential target of treatment for pSS based on the downregulation of IKK expression and deregulation of NF-B pathway."
6534,722,Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies are important in pathogenesis and diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
6535,722,"Ro60, Ro52 and La are RNA binding proteins of Y RNA, which were discovered more than three decades ago."
6536,722,Significance of Y RNA is not appreciated as much as Ro and La in SS.
6537,722,"It can be hypothesised that 5'-YsRNA, short fragment derived from Y RNA may be recognized by TLR7 in pDC, which induces type I interferon signature in SS."
6538,722,"New genomics tools, namely RNA seq, enables assay of 5'-YsRNA in blood."
6539,722,5'-YsRNA has the potential to be a novel biomarker of SS.
6540,723,Pulmonary carcinoid and pulmonary lymphoma are both rare cancers and are seldom seen together.
6541,723,"Cases have been reported of their coexistence in the gastrointestinal tract, but our literature searches only found a single case of their coexistence in the lung."
6542,723,We discuss our case as well as the literature to try to find a connection and explanation for this occurrence.
6543,724,OBJECTIVES: Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a very rare autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation and destruction of cartilaginous tissues.
6544,724,"We examined the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of Japanese RP patients."
6545,724,METHODS: We identified 8 RP cases in our department between 2003 and 2017.
6546,724,"Detailed clinical features, testing, treatment, and outcomes were recorded."
6547,724,RESULTS: The mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 9 months.
6548,724,Four cases presented with auricular chondritis and laryngotracheal involvement and 3 cases presented with a saddle nose deformity.
6549,724,Anti-type II collagen antibody was positive in 5 of 6 cases.
6550,724,"Of 3 cases with associated diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Sjgren's syndrome), 2 died of respiratory failure."
6551,724,"CONCLUSIONS: When RP is diagnosed, early computed tomography or pulmonary function testing is essential to enable early treatment."
6552,724,"Undiagnosed airway involvement can cause tracheobronchial wall fibrosis, leading to fixed stenosis."
6553,725,OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To validate a technique and outcomes of labial minor salivary gland biopsy (LSGB) used for the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
6554,725,STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
6555,725,METHODS: Clinical data were prospectively obtained pre- and postbiopsy using patient-reported questionnaires.
6556,725,LSGB was performed using described methods.
6557,725,Specimens were analyzed by a pathologist with expertise in SS and assessed using established criteria to determine the focus score.
6558,725,Data were analyzed using cross-tabulations.
6559,725,"RESULTS: Among the 58 patients in the study, 52 (90%) presented with sicca symptoms of dry eyes and/or mouth."
6560,725,Eight patients (14%) had histopathologic findings supportive of a diagnosis of SS.
6561,725,"At 1 month postbiopsy, greater than 71% of patients denied any complaints of pain, swelling, numbness."
6562,725,or tingling.
6563,725,Sixteen patients (28%) had only a minor level of complaints.
6564,725,Only one patient complained of severe numbness at the biopsy site.
6565,725,"Greater than 70% of patients would consider rebiopsy after the procedure, if requested by their physician."
6566,725,CONCLUSIONS: We present a safe and effective method of LSGB for the diagnosis of SS.
6567,725,"LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 126:2041-2046, 2016."
6568,726,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease with exocrine gland dysfunction and multi-organ involvement.
6569,726,Recent progress in understanding the pathogenesis of pSS offers an opportunity to find new biomarkers for the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity.
6570,726,Screening noninvasive biomarkers from the saliva and tears has significant potential.
6571,726,The need for specific and sensitive biomarker candidates in pSS is significant.
6572,726,"This review aims to summarize recent advances in the identification of biomarkers of Sjgren syndrome, trying to identify reliable, sensitive, and specific biomarkers that can be used to guide treatment decisions."
6573,727,A study was performed to investigate whether expression of aquaporin (AQP) 3 and 5 has potential as a marker for distinguishing dry mouth from Sjgren's syndrome.
6574,727,"Twenty-five patients underwent labial minor salivary gland biopsy (dry mouth, n = 9; Sjgren's syndrome, n = 16; control, n = 8)."
6575,727,"All patients were interviewed about their medical history and subjective oral symptoms, and intraoral examinations were conducted."
6576,727,Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to examine the expression and localization of AQP3 and 5.
6577,727,"Significant differences in oral dryness, dry eye, medical history, and Saxon test results were revealed among the groups."
6578,727,"However, there were no significant inter-group differences in expression of mRNA for AQP3 and 5."
6579,727,"Immunohistochemical staining for AQP3 was localized mainly in the basolateral and part of the ductal cell membrane, and was barely evident in the apical membrane of acinar cells."
6580,727,"AQP5 was localized to the basolateral and apical membrane and cytoplasm, but not the ductal cell membrane."
6581,727,"Staining intensity for AQP3 in the apical membrane was significantly stronger in Sjgren's syndrome, and that for AQP5 was significantly weaker in dry mouth."
6582,727,"Taken together, the present data suggest that expression of AQP3 and 5 may be a marker for distinguishing between patients with dry mouth and those with Sjgren's syndrome."
6583,728,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a progressive systemic autoimmune disorder with a strong female predominance.
6584,728,Hormonal influences are thought to play a role in the development of pSS.
6585,728,"However, no studies have specifically evaluated the association between irregular menstrual cycles and pSS."
6586,728,"Therefore, using a health claims database, this study investigated the risk of pSS in women with irregular menstrual cycles."
6587,728,We conducted a case-control study using the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database.
6588,728,"A total of 360 patients diagnosed with pSS (International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification, ICD-9-CM code 710.2) between 2001 and 2012 were identified."
6589,728,Controls were frequency-matched at a rate of 5:1 to the cases by five-year age interval and index year.
6590,728,Both cases and controls were retrospectively traced back until 2001 for the diagnosis of irregular menstrual cycles (ICD-9-CM code 626.4).
6591,728,The risk of pSS was assessed using multivariate logistic regression analyses.
6592,728,"Irregular menstrual cycles were significantly associated with pSS [adjusted odds ratio, (AOR) = 1.38, p = 0.027], after adjusted for insured amount, urbanization level, and thyroid disorder."
6593,728,"In addition, when the data were stratified by three age categories, only the patients in the age category of 45-55 years showed significant association between irregular menstrual cycles and pSS (AOR = 1.74, p = 0.005)."
6594,728,"In this nationwide, population-based case-control study, we found a significant increased risk of pSS in female patients with irregular menstrual cycles, particularly those in their mid-forties to mid-fifties."
6595,729,OBJECTIVE: To report the point prevalence of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in the first US population-based study.
6596,729,"METHODS: Cases of all potential primary SS patients living in Olmsted County, Minnesota, on January 1, 2015, were retrieved using Rochester Epidemiology Project resources, and ascertained by manual medical records review."
6597,729,Primary SS cases were defined according to physician diagnosis.
6598,729,The use of diagnostic tests was assessed and the performance of classification criteria was evaluated.
6599,729,The number of prevalent cases in 2015 was also projected based on 1976-2005 incidence data from the same source population.
6600,729,"RESULTS: A total of 106 patients with primary SS were included in the study: 86% were female, with a meanSD age of 64.615.2 years, and a meanSD disease duration of 10.58.4 years."
6601,729,"A majority were anti-SSA positive (75%) and/or anti-SSB positive (58%), but only 22% met American-European Consensus Group or American College of Rheumatology criteria, because the other tests required for disease classification (ocular dryness objective assessment, salivary gland functional or morphologic tests, or salivary gland biopsy) were rarely performed in clinical practice."
6602,729,"According to the physician diagnosis, the age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of primary SS was 10.3 per 10,000 inhabitants, but according to classification criteria, this prevalence was only 2.2 per 10,000."
6603,729,"The analysis based on previous incidence data projected a similar 2015 prevalence rate of 11.0 per 10,000."
6604,729,"CONCLUSION: The prevalence of primary SS in this geographically well-defined population was estimated to be between 2 and 10 per 10,000 inhabitants."
6605,729,Physicians rarely used tests included in the classification criteria to diagnose the disease in this community setting.
6606,730,"PURPOSE: To evaluate quantitative and visual salivary gland scintigraphy in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and to compare the scintigraphic findings with clinicopathological features of the salivary, lacrimal and thyroid glands."
6607,730,METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with primary SS and 10 healthy age-matched and sex-matched individuals as a control group were included in this study.
6608,730,The diagnosis of SS was made on the basis of the classification criteria of the American-European Consensus Group.
6609,730,The patients with primary SS were divided into two groups as early-stage and advanced-stage according the labial biposy scores (16 early-stage and 11 advanced-stage).
6610,730,"After the administration of 370 MBq Tc-99m pertechnetate, static images were obtained at 20 min and also after lemon stimulation."
6611,730,"Functional parameters for the parotid, submandibular, and thyroid glands were calculated."
6612,730,"Schirmer-I, tear film break-up time and Rose Bengal tests were evaluated."
6613,730,RESULT: Statistically significant differences existed for the functional parameters of the parotid and submandibular glands between the early-stage and advanced-stage groups.
6614,730,The submandibular glands were more frequently affected than the parotid glands.
6615,730,Asymmetric uptake pattern was more common in the parotid glands during the early-stages of primary SS.
6616,730,"When compared with the control group, the thyroid uptake ratio of the early-stage primary SS and advanced-stage group was not significantly different."
6617,730,"According to the results of the ophthalmological tests, there was a statistically significant difference between patients with advanced-stage and early-stage disease."
6618,730,There were no significant correlations between functional parameters of salivary gland and any of the ophthalmological tests.
6619,730,CONCLUSION: The results indicate that quantitative salivary gland scintigraphy may be a useful method for evaluating salivary gland dysfunction and also for determining disease severity in primary SS.
6620,730,Asymmetric activity pattern in the parotid glands commonly observed during the early stages of the disease may be a predictor of progression.
6621,730,"In addition, the histopathological stage is related not only to the scintigraphic findings of the salivary glands but also to lacrimal gland function in primary SS."
6622,730,"However, thyroid uptake seemed to be unaffected in patients with both early-stage and advanced-stage disease."
6623,731,A comprehensive evaluation of oral and ocular symptoms and findings in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients may provide valuable information for management.
6624,731,"Medical history was obtained from female pSS patients, and sex- and age-matched non-SS patients with sicca symptoms (non-SS sicca controls) as well as healthy subjects without sicca complaints (healthy controls)."
6625,731,"Oral (Summated Xerostomia Inventory, SXI) and ocular (McMonnies Dry Eye questionnaire, MDEIS, and Ocular Surface Disease Index, OSDI) subjective complaints were recorded."
6626,731,"Objective findings including clinical oral dryness scores (CODS), unstimulated and stimulated saliva secretion rates (UWS/SWS), Schirmer I test, tear osmolarity, tear film break-up time (TFBUT), and ocular surface staining (OSS) were determined."
6627,731,"The pSS and non-SS sicca controls were extensively troubled by subjective dryness, while the pSS group had higher CODS, significantly lower saliva and tear secretion, shorter TFBUT and higher OSSthan both control groups."
6628,731,"Furthermore, candida counts were significantly higher in the pSS patients."
6629,731,"In the pSS group, subjective oral dryness significantly correlated with ocular dryness (MDEIS: r=0.5, OSDI: r=0.413) and SWS was significantly correlated with Schirmer I (r=0.419)."
6630,731,"The findings imply that interdisciplinary subjective and objective evaluation of patients with xerostomia and xerophthalmia not only have implications for patient care, but also may guide clinicians in differentiating between pSS and non-SS sicca patients."
6631,732,"Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD), a histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (HNL), characteristically presents as cervical lymphadenopathy in young Asian women."
6632,732,Most resolve spontaneously with rare recurrences described.
6633,732,We report a patient with biopsy-proven recurrence of KFD-like HNL after almost 8 years and analyze 65 additional published cases with recurrences.
6634,732,"While those with recurrences similarly affect young (average age = 27 years), Asian (80%) women (76%), 73% had multiple sites of involvement and 32% of those tested had underlying autoimmune conditions."
6635,732,"Our case is unusual with respect to the following: (a) Age: 50 years, the oldest among the reported patients with recurrences."
6636,732,"(b) Race: African descent, with only 3 others reported with recurrent HNL."
6637,732,"Of these 4 cases, 2 had underlying autoimmunity."
6638,732,(c) Underlying condition: Her clinical and laboratory features were best felt to represent Sjgren's syndrome (SjS).
6639,732,Only 2 other cases of SjS-associated HNL have been reported; in 2 recently reported cases SjS developed subsequently.
6640,733,"Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) is one of the most common autoimmune rheumatic diseases, clinically characterized by xerostomia and keratoconjunctivitis sicca."
6641,733,We investigated the following controversial topics: (i) Do we have reliable ways of assessing saliva production?
6642,733,(ii) How important are the quantity and quality of saliva?
6643,733,(iii) Are only anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La relevant for the diagnosis of SjS?
6644,733,(iv) Are the American-European Consensus criteria (AECC) the best way to diagnose SjS?
6645,733,"Results from literature searches suggested the following: (i) Despite the fact that numerous tests are available to assess salivation rates, direct comparisons among them are scarce with little evidence to suggest one best test."
6646,733,(ii) Recent developments highlight the importance of investigating the composition of saliva.
6647,733,"However, more research is needed to standardize the methods of analysis and collection and refine the quality of the accumulating data."
6648,733,"(iii) In addition to anti-Ro/La autoantibodies, anti -fodrin IgA and anti-MR3 autoantibodies seem to be promising diagnostic markers of SjS, but more studies are warranted to test their sensitivity and specificity."
6649,733,"(iv) AECC are classification, not diagnostic criteria."
6650,733,"Moreover, recent innovations have not been incorporated into these criteria."
6651,733,"Consequently, treatment directed to patients diagnosed using the AECC might exclude a significant proportion of patients with SjS."
6652,734,"OBJECTIVES: Although most reported patients with immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) are from the Far East, we aimed to identify patients suffering from IgG4-RD in our University Centre in Debrecen, Hungary."
6653,734,"METHOD: Serum IgG4 levels were measured at 51 of our 800 patients followed up because of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) if one or more clinical signs during the disease course raised the possibility of IgG4-RD (persisting salivary gland swelling, absence of anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies in the serum, and positive salivary gland biopsy, coexistence of autoimmune pancreatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, or primary sclerosing cholangitis, persisting lymphadenopathy)."
6654,734,"Where available, histological samples of small salivary gland biopsies were revised to detect the particular features of IgG4-RD."
6655,734,Pathologists and surgeons were informed about the disease and asked to refer suspicious cases.
6656,734,"RESULTS: Based on our survey, eight patients were identified with IgG4-RD."
6657,734,"Pancreatic, salivary gland, aortic, and retroperitoneal manifestations were detected."
6658,734,"Of the 51 patients with SS, four appeared to have IgG4-RD, but eventually one was excluded."
6659,734,"CONCLUSIONS: Although IgG4-RD is not yet well known to physicians of Western countries, it occurs in Caucasians and probably in other races as well."
6660,734,"Moreover, our eight cases diagnosed with IgG4-RD demonstrate a relatively large European patient population collected in a single centre."
6661,734,"European clinicians, and especially rheumatologists, should be informed and at least certain laboratories should be prepared to investigate patient samples if the suspicion of IgG4-RD is raised."
6662,734,The main clinical significance of an accurate diagnosis is the extreme corticosteroid sensitivity of IgG4-RD.
6663,735,"INTRODUCTION: Central neurological manifestations of primary Sjogren's syndrome are very polymorphic, including pachymeningitis, one of the rarest manifestations, which is exceptionally inaugural."
6664,735,CLINICAL CASE: A 50-year-old patient was admitted for an intracranial hypertension syndrome with paralysis of the III and VII cranial nerves.
6665,735,Brain MRI revealed pachymeningitis of the right cerebral hemisphere.
6666,735,History taking revealed the existence of xerostomy and xerophthalmos.
6667,735,The accessory salivary gland biopsy demonstrated Chisholm stageIII sialadenitis.
6668,735,Search for anti-SSA antibodies and anti-SSB antibodies was positive.
6669,735,The diagnosis of primary Sjogren's syndrome was retained.
6670,735,The patient improved with corticosteroid therapy and cyclophosphamide.
6671,735,CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the unusual observation of pachymeningitis in primary Sjogren's syndrome in the rare setting as an inaugural manifestation.
6672,736,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the association of smoking habits with the clinical, serological, and histopathological manifestations of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and non-Sjgren's sicca (non-SS sicca)."
6673,736,METHODS: Cross-sectional case-control study of 1288 patients with sicca symptoms (587 SS and 701 non-SS sicca) evaluated in a multi-disciplinary research clinic.
6674,736,"Smoking patterns were obtained from questionnaire data and disease-related clinical and laboratory data were compared between current, past, ever, and never smokers."
6675,736,"RESULTS: Current smoking rates were 4.6% for SS patients compared to 14.1% in non-SS sicca (p = 5.17x10E-09), 18% in a local lupus cohort (p = 1.13x10E-14) and 16.8% in the community (p = 4.12x10E-15)."
6676,736,"Current smoking was protective against SS classification (OR 0.35, 95%CI 0.22-0.56, FDR q = 1.9E10-05), focal lymphocytic sialadenitis (OR 0.26, 95%CI 0.15-0.44, FDR q = 1.52x10E-06), focus score 1 (OR 0.22, 95%CI 0.13-0.39, FDR q = 1.43x10E-07), and anti-Ro/SSA(+) (OR 0.36, 95%CI 0.2-0.64, FDR q = 0.0009); ever smoking was protective against the same features and against anti-La/SSB(+) (OR 0.52, 95%CI 0.39-0.70, FDR q = 5.82x10E-05)."
6677,736,"Duration of smoking was inversely correlated with SS even after controlling for socioeconomic status, BMI, alcohol and caffeine consumption."
6678,736,"CONCLUSIONS: Current tobacco smoking is negatively and independently associated with SS, protecting against disease-associated humoral and cellular autoimmunity."
6679,736,The overall smoking rate amongst SS patients is significantly lower than in matched populations and the effects of smoking are proportional to exposure duration.
6680,736,"In spite of the protective effects of tobacco on SS manifestations, it is associated with other serious comorbidities such as lung disease, cardiovascular risk and malignancy, and should thus be strongly discouraged in patients with sicca."
6681,737,The objective of this study was to evaluate the 25-year outcome of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
6682,737,One hundred and fifty-two patients diagnosed with pSS (American-European classification criteria) were retrospectively and descriptively analysed (1986-2011).
6683,737,"Of all 152 patients, 55.9% were alive, 18.4% had died and 25.7% discontinued follow-up (mostly due to old age)."
6684,737,Malignancy affected 28.3% and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) affected 10.5%.
6685,737,"The adjusted risk for development of NHL was an odds ratio (OR) of 10.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.05-36.42) in patients with vasculitis (p<0.001), and OR 3.4 (95% CI 1.05-11.2) in the presence of glandular complications (parotid swelling, lymphadenopathy) (p < 0.041)."
6686,737,"Seventy-five patients (49.3%) developed other autoimmune diseases (autoimmune thyroid disease [15.8%], pulmonary fibrosis [7.2%] and vasculitis [10.5%])."
6687,737,"Although the course of pSS is relatively benign, over 25 years patients experience more clinical complications than previously described."
6688,737,"In addition, vasculitis and glandular manifestations were significant predictors for NHL."
6689,738,"Longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) is defined as a spinal cord lesion that extends over three or more vertebrae, as seen on MRI of the spine."
6690,738,"The clinical presentation of a patient with LETM is often dramatic and can consist of paraparesis or tetraparesis, sensory disturbances, and gait, bladder, bowel and/or sexual dysfunction."
6691,738,"LETM is a characteristic feature of neuromyelitis optica, but such spinal lesions can also occur in various other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases that involve the CNS--such as multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis or Sjgren syndrome--or in infectious diseases with CNS involvement."
6692,738,Patients with a neoplastic disorder or traumatic spinal cord injury can also present with longitudinal spinal lesions.
6693,738,"In this Review, the signs and symptoms that suggest various etiologies and differential diagnoses of LETM are described, and illustrated by educational case studies."
6694,738,The best therapeutic options for patients with each diagnosis are also discussed.
6695,739,OBJECTIVES: The relationship between cognitive symptoms and underlying neuropathology in primary SS (PSS) is poorly understood.
6696,739,We used high-resolution quantitative brain MRI to identify potential structural correlates of cognitive symptoms.
6697,739,METHODS: Subjects completed a comprehensive neuropsychometric evaluation.
6698,739,"Imaging was performed on a 3 T MRI scanner with T(1) and proton density-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences."
6699,739,"We compared MRI group metrics (impaired PSS, not-impaired PSS and controls) and tested for correlations between DTI results and neuropsychological measurements (significance threshold P = 0.05)."
6700,739,RESULTS: Nineteen PSS patients (who met American-European Consensus Group 2002 criteria) and 17 healthy controls completed the cognitive evaluation.
6701,739,"MRI scans were performed in six impaired PSS, seven not-impaired PSS and seven controls."
6702,739,"No differences were found in regional volumetrics, nor was there a difference in T(2) lesion load between groups."
6703,739,Fractional anisotropy (FA) in the inferior frontal white matter (WM) was lower (P = 0.021) and mean diffusivity higher (P = 0.003) in the impaired PSS relative to the control group.
6704,739,Inferior frontal FA was correlated with cognitive symptoms (P = 0.0064) and with verbal memory (P = 0.0125).
6705,739,"CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory study, frontal region WM microstructure alterations accompanied cognitive symptoms and were associated with mild cognitive impairment in PSS."
6706,739,"While additional study is warranted to assess the specificity and stability of these results, DTI could provide novel insight into the pathological processes accompanying the subtle cognitive dysfunction commonly experienced by PSS patients."
6707,740,OBJECTIVE: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is considered to be a universal exocrinopathy most likely based on autoimmune mechanisms.
6708,740,"The degree of exocrine involvement in SS with the exception of salivary and lachrymal glands is, however, not yet established."
6709,740,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: We therefore examined the morphology, the exocrine and endocrine functions of the pancreas in 12 healthy consecutively included levolunteers with established SS, but without known pancreatic disease, using secretin-stimulated magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), a Lundh test, oral glucose tolerance test, and blood sampling."
6710,740,"RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of the patients had morphological changes of pancreas as evaluated by secretin-stimulated MRCP, and two patients had chronic pancreatitis-like changes."
6711,740,Four patients had reduced exocrine function of the pancreas with either significantly reduced amylase and/or lipase in the pancreatic juice.
6712,740,CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of pancreatic dysfunction was increased to 25-33% in the study population which is much higher than in the background population.
6713,740,"Thus, pancreatic dysfunction and chronic pancreatitis should be considered in SS."
6714,741,"Porphyria cutanea tarda is prevalent in connective tissue disease, common in systemic lupus erythematosus."
6715,741,"However, the co-existence of primary sjogren's syndrome and porphyria cutanea tarda is rare and poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges."
6716,741,We report a case of porphyria cutanea tarda associated with primary sjogren's syndrome.
6717,742,OBJECTIVE: To compare parotid diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) taken before and after abatacept therapy in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to examine the utility in evaluation and prediction of response to therapy.
6718,742,METHODS: DWIs of the parotid glands taken at baseline and 52 weeks after initiation of abatacept were analyzed in nine SS patients with RA using relative standard deviation (RSD) of the entire glands and signal intensity ratio (SIR) within the residual parenchyma.
6719,742,The correlation between changes in RSD and SIR and changes in salivary secretion based on Saxon's test was examined.
6720,742,"Furthermore, baseline characteristics were compared in patients with increased and decreased salivary secretion after treatment."
6721,742,The predictive power of the parameter at baseline was examined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
6722,742,"RESULTS: Abatacept improved salivary secretion from 20761535 at baseline to 28571431mg/2min at 52 weeks (n=9, p=.05)."
6723,742,"Increase of salivary secretion was significantly higher in patients with decreased RSD (n=6) than increased RSD (n=3) (1241713, -137142mg/2min, p=.02)."
6724,742,The increase and decrease in RSD completely accorded with those of salivary secretion.
6725,742,"Furthermore, SIR was the only parameter that was significantly different between patients with posttreatment increase and decrease in salivary secretion (p=.04)."
6726,742,"ROC analysis showed the sensitivity and specificity of SIR at baseline of 13.010(-2) for the prediction of the response to abatacept were 75.0% and 83.3%, respectively."
6727,742,CONCLUSIONS: Parotid DWI seems to be useful for evaluating and predicting the response in salivary secretion to abatacept in SS patients with RA.
6728,743,OBJECTIVE: To describe the main characteristics of patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (SS) and white matter abnormalities (WMA) seen by a specialist SS unit.
6729,743,METHODS: The study cohort included 321 consecutive patients fulfilling the 2002 classification criteria for primary SS.
6730,743,We retrospectively analyzed the results of neuroimaging studies performed in patients who presented with neurological symptoms.
6731,743,Patients were further evaluated by three neurologists to determine fulfillment of the McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS).
6732,743,"RESULTS: Fifty-one (16%) patients had at least one neuroimaging study, and 25 of these had WMA."
6733,743,"WMA were classified as vascular pathological changes in 21 patients: 10 had multiple small focal lesions, 7 had beginning confluence of lesions and 4 had diffuse involvement of the entire region."
6734,743,WMA were classified as inflammatory/demyelinating lesions (MS-like) in 4 patients who fulfilled the MRI Barkhof criteria.
6735,743,"Patients with inflammatory/demyelinating lesions were younger (53.7 vs. 73.5 years, P=0.001) and had a lower frequency of hypertension (25% vs. 86%, P=0.031) and altered glomerular filtration rate (0% vs. 70%, P=0.047) in comparison with patients with vascular lesions."
6736,743,"The multivariate age-sex adjusted model including the seven variables which were statistically significant in the univariate analysis (antimalarial therapy, leukopenia, anti-La/SSB antibodies, diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and HDL-c levels) identified hypertension (P=0.019) and HDL-c levels (P=0.032) as independent predictors of WMA in primary SS patients."
6737,743,CONCLUSION: Neuroimaging studies disclosed WMA in 49% of patients with primary SS and suspected neurological involvement.
6738,743,"WMA were identified as vascular pathological changes in 80% of the patients, and hypertension and HDL-c levels as predictive factors for this association."
6739,744,"Although renal calcium crystal deposits (nephrocalcinosis) may occur in acute phosphate poisoning as well as type 1 renal tubular acidosis (RTA), hyperphosphatemic hypocalcemia is common in the former while normocalcemic hypokalemia is typical in the latter."
6740,744,"Here, as a unique coexistence of these two seperated clinical entities, we report a 30-yr-old woman presenting with carpal spasm related to hypocalcemia (ionized calcium of 1.90 mM/L) due to acute phosphate poisoning after oral sodium phosphate bowel preparation, which resolved rapidly after calcium gluconate intravenously."
6741,744,"Subsequently, type 1 RTA due to Sjgren's syndrome was unveiled by sustained hypokalemia (3.3 to 3.4 mEq/L), persistent alkaline urine pH (> 6.0) despite metabolic acidosis, and medullary nephrocalcinosis."
6742,744,"Through this case report, the differential points of nephrocalcinosis and electrolyte imbalances between them are discussed, and focused more on diagnostic tests and managements of type 1 RTA."
6743,745,OBJECTIVES: To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of anti-alpha-fodrin antibodies for primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
6744,745,METHODS: Sixty-four pSS subjects and 108 non-pSS patients were prospectively enrolled in this study.
6745,745,Serum anti-alpha-fodrin IgA and IgG were detected by ELISA in a blind fashion.
6746,745,The diagnostic accuracy of anti-alpha-fodrin antibodies was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
6747,745,Logistic regression was used to investigate whether anti-alpha-fodrin antibodies could improve the accuracy of pSS diagnosis if used in addition to anti-SSA and anti-SSB.
6748,745,"RESULTS: The areas under the ROC curves for anti-alpha-fodrin IgG and IgA were 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60-0.77) and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.54-0.72), respectively (P < 0.01 for both)."
6749,745,"The optimal diagnostic thresholds for anti-fodrin IgG and IgA were 11.75 U/ml and 9.75 U/ml, respectively, with a sensitivity of 0.59 and 0.55, and a specificity of 0.75 and 0.73, respectively."
6750,745,Anti-alpha-fodrin IgG and IgA antibodies were associated with pSS after adjustment for anti-SSA and anti-SSB.
6751,745,CONCLUSIONS: Anti-alpha-fodrin IgG and IgA antibodies are useful diagnostic markers which may improve the accuracy of pSS diagnosis.
6752,746,Acquired Gitelman's syndrome (GS) associated with Sjgren syndrome (SS) is rare.
6753,746,"A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our department because of nausea, acratia and sicca complex."
6754,746,"Laboratory tests after admission showed renal failure, hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalciuria, all of which met the diagnostic criteria for GS."
6755,746,Diagnostic evaluation identified primary SS as the cause of the acquired GS.
6756,746,Light microscopy of the renal tissue from the patient showed severe membranoproliferative glomerunephritis and tubulointerstitial nephritis.
6757,746,Immunohistochemical staining of the renal tissue showed the absence of sodium-chloride co-transporter (NCCT) in distal convoluted tubules.
6758,746,Genetic analysis of chromosomal DNA extracted from the patient's peripheral blood showed SLC12A3 gene heterozygous mutation.
6759,746,"The reported case was comprehensively analyzed on the basis of the clinical features, and laboratory, pathological and genetic test findings."
6760,746,The patient has achieved a complete remission after meticulous care and appropriate treatment.
6761,747,OBJECTIVE: We attempted to determine whether clinical features could differentiate painful small-fiber neuropathy related to primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS-SFN) from idiopathic SFN (idio-SFN).
6762,747,METHODS: Validated clinical questionnaires and neurophysiological investigations specific for pain and SFN assessment were performed in 25 patients with pSS-SFN and 25 patients with idio-SFN.
6763,747,RESULTS: Patients with idio-SFN had more frequent severe burning sensations and higher mean anxiety scores and daily pain intensity compared to patients with pSSSFN.
6764,747,"Conversely, patients with pSS-SFN had reduced electrochemical skin conductance measured by Sudoscan_, and almost half of them had the sensation of walking on cotton wool."
6765,747,"CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that idio-SFN more specifically involved small sensory fibers than pSS-SFN, in which subtle dysfunction of larger sensory fibers and damage of distal autonomic sudomotor innervation may occur."
6766,747,"A practical algorithm is proposed to help to differentiate SFN associated with pSS from idio-SFN, based on information very easy to obtain by clinical interview."
6767,748,The aim of this study was to assess nailfold capillaroscopic (NC) findings in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS) with and without Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) as well as in the presence of positive anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies.
6768,748,Videocapillaroscopy was performed in 150 patients with PSS.
6769,748,"Data collected included demographics, presence of RP, PSS symptoms, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-CCP, salivary scintigraphy, labial biopsy, and NC findings."
6770,748,"RP was present in 32% of PSS, keratoconjunctivitis sicca in 91%, oral xerosis in 93%, and skin or genital xerosis in 53%."
6771,748,"In patients with positive anti-SSA/Ro (75%) and positive anti-SSB/La (40%), NC showed normal findings in 53% of cases and non-specific in 36%."
6772,748,"In patients with PSS, NC was normal in 51% of cases and non-specific in 34%."
6773,748,Scleroderma pattern was found in 14 patients.
6774,748,RP associated with PSS had non-specific capillaroscopy in 40% of cases (p = 0.1).
6775,748,"Pericapillary haemorrhages (p = 0.06) and capillary thrombosis (p = 0.2) were not increased, but more dilated capillaries were detected in 48% of cases."
6776,748,Patients with positive anti-Ro and/or anti-La have not a distinct NC profile.
6777,748,"Patients with RP associated with PSS had more dilated capillaries, but neither pericapillary haemorrhages nor capillary thrombosis was observed."
6778,749,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical presentation, management and prognosis of patients diagnosed with both primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV)."
6779,749,METHODS: French nation-wide survey completed by a systematic literature review.
6780,749,"RESULTS: This work identified 7 new cases of coexisting pSS and AAV: 2 microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), 2 granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), 2 anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA renal-limited AAV, and 1 eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)."
6781,749,The systematic literature search identified 15 previously published cases.
6782,749,"Among the 22 patients, 19 were females."
6783,749,Mean age at diagnosis of AAV was 63.99.8years.
6784,749,All individuals with available information experienced at least one extra-glandular manifestation attributable to pSS.
6785,749,"p-ANCA with anti-MPO specificity were found in 76.2% (16/21), c-ANCA with anti-PR3 specificity in 14.3% (3/21) and isolated c-ANCA in 13.6% (3/22)."
6786,749,"Vasculitis involved kidneys (n=13), lungs (n=8), skin (n=6), peripheral nerves (n=5), central nervous system (n=2), small bowel (n=1), muscle (n=1), ear chondritis (n=1) and sinuses (n=1)."
6787,749,The mean AAV follow-up was 73.5 (120.0) months.
6788,749,"While on treatment, disease remission occurred in 77.3% of cases, and one death was reported in the first 6months after diagnosis."
6789,749,CONCLUSION: This work shows that AAV may occur in patients with pSS.
6790,749,These are most commonly p-ANCA associated vasculitis with anti-MPO specificity.
6791,749,"AAV may reveal an underlying pSS or arise during its evolution, but did not precede pSS in any of these cases."
6792,749,AAV occurrence appears to be correlated with extra-glandular manifestations of pSS.
6793,750,This report describes a patient with autoimmune myelofibrosis accompanied by Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
6794,750,"A 36-year-old woman was admitted due to petechiae, purpura, gingival bleeding, dyspnea on exertion, and a lack of concentration."
6795,750,She had pancytopenia and was diagnosed with SS.
6796,750,A bone marrow study showed hypercellular marrow with reticulin fibrosis.
6797,750,Lymphocytic infiltrates and aggregates composed of a mixture of T and B cells in the marrow were also observed.
6798,750,"A chromosomal analysis of the marrow cells showed 47, XXX and an analysis of peripheral lymphocytes revealed 47, XXX/46, XX mosaic results."
6799,750,The patient's cytopenia resolved following treatment with oral prednisolone.
6800,751,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between self-reported cognitive abilities, psychological symptoms and neuropsychological outcomes in PSS."
6801,751,"METHODS: Patients with Primary Sjogren's syndrome (PSS) and healthy controls completed a comprehensive neuropsychometric battery and questionnaires: the Centers for Epidemiological Scale-Depression, the Profile of Fatigue-mental domain (Prof-M) for cognitive symptoms, Fatigue Severity Scale, and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire."
6802,751,"RESULTS: Female patients with PSS (N = 39) were similar to controls (N = 17) in estimated premorbid intellectual function, age and education."
6803,751,"Depression (P = 0.002), cognitive symptoms (P = 0.001), fatigue (P = 0.000003), and pain (P = 0.024) scores were greater in the patient group."
6804,751,Patients with PSS demonstrated inferior performance relative to controls in psychomotor processing (P = 0.027) and verbal reasoning (P = 0.007).
6805,751,"Patients with PSS with and without depression had similar performance on multiple tests, but depressed patients had significantly lower scores for executive function (P = 0.041)."
6806,751,"Cognitive symptoms correlated with verbal memory (P = 0.048), whereas pain correlated with executive function measures (Stroop, P = 0.017) and working memory (Trails B, P = 0.036)."
6807,751,"In the regression model, depression and verbal memory were independent predictors that accounted for 61% of the variance in cognitive symptoms."
6808,751,CONCLUSION: The Prof-M is a simple self-report measure which could be useful in screening PSS subjects who may benefit from detailed psychometric evaluation.
6809,751,Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that depression and verbal memory impairment are overlapping but independent aspects of neural involvement in PSS.
6810,751,"While pain and depression are significant confounders of cognitive function in PSS, this study suggests that impaired verbal reasoning ability in PSS is not attributable to pain or depression."
6811,752,IgG4-related disease is a novel lymphoproliferative disorder that shows hyper-IgG4--globulinemia and IgG4-producing plasma cell expansion in affected organs with fibrotic or sclerotic changes.
6812,752,Patients show systemic inflammatory conditions and various symptoms depending on the affected organ.
6813,752,"Since the first report of patients with elevated serum IgG4 in sclerosing pancreatitis in 2001, various systemic disorders described by many names have been reported."
6814,752,"Despite similarities in the organs involved in IgG4-related Mikulicz's disease and Sjgren's syndrome, there are marked clinical and pathological differences between these conditions."
6815,752,"Most patients diagnosed with autoimmune pancreatitis in Japan have IgG4-related pancreatitis [Type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis (LPSP)], a disease distinct from some of the western type [Type 2 AIP, idiopathic duct-centric chronic pancreatitis (IDCP), autoimmune pancreatitis with granulocytic epithelial lesions (GEL)]."
6816,752,Diagnosis of IgG4-related disease is characterized by both elevated serum IgG4 (>135 mg/dL) and histopathological features including lymphocyte and IgG4(+) plasma cell infiltration (IgG4(+) plasma cells/IgG(+) plasma cells>40%).
6817,752,"Differential diagnosis from other distinct disorders, such as sarcoidosis, Castleman's disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, lymphoma, cancer, and other existing conditions associated with high serum IgG4 level or abundant IgG4-bearing plasma cells in tissues is necessary."
6818,752,We have begun a clinical prospective study to establish a treatment strategy (Phase II prospective treatment study for IgG4-multiorgan lymphoproliferative syndrome: UMIN R000002311).
6819,753,Renal tubular acidosis is a common cause of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis but these disorders can be easily missed or misdiagnosed.
6820,753,We highlight the approach to assessing renal tubular acidosis by discussing a case study with a temporal data set collected over more than 5 weeks.
6821,753,We highlight the principles and the necessary information required for a diagnosis of classic distal renal tubular acidosis.
6822,753,"We also briefly review several aspects of type 1 renal tubular acidosis related to autoimmune disease, drugs and thyroid disorders."
6823,754,PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tear film functions and clinical symptoms of patients with migraines.
6824,754,METHODS: This observational comparative study consisted of 33 migraine (26 women and 7 men) patients referred from neurology clinics and 33 (22 women and 11 men) control subjects referred from ophthalmology outpatient clinics.
6825,754,The control subjects had neither systemic nor ocular disease nor any type of headache.
6826,754,"All 66 patients underwent a complete ophthalmic examination and diagnostic tests for dry eye, including tear break-up time, Schirmer test with topical anesthesia, lissamine green staining, and an ocular surface disease score."
6827,754,"Patients with migraine were classified as migraine with an aura, migraine without an aura, and basilar migraine; a pain score from 1 to 4 was determined for each patient, based on the American Headache Society's Migraine Disability Assessment Test."
6828,754,"RESULTS: Of the 33 patients who participated in the migraine group, 17 (51%) suffered from migraine with aura, 11 (33%) suffered from migraine without aura, and 5 (15%) suffered from basilar migraine."
6829,754,Significant differences in dry eye scores were found between the patients with migraine and the control subjects.
6830,754,"In the migraine group, the mean tear break-up time was 7.752.37 seconds, whereas in the control group it was 9.151.93 seconds."
6831,754,"For the Schirmer test, the migraine group had a mean value of 12.094.95 mm/5 minutes, whereas the control group had a mean value of 14.904.26 mm/5 minutes."
6832,754,Testing with lissamine green staining resulted in a mean value of 1.000.16 in the migraine group and 0.300.46 in the control group.
6833,754,"In the migraine group, the mean for the ocular surface disease index scoring was 36.2717.54."
6834,754,"In the control group, it was 28.429.0."
6835,754,A significant difference (P<0.05) was found in the dry eye syndrome testing results between the 2 groups in this study.
6836,754,"CONCLUSIONS: An increased frequency of dry eye disease was found to occur in patients with migraine, which might suggest that migraine headaches are related to dry eye disease."
6837,754,Some migraine attacks may be aggravated in the presence of dry eye syndrome.
6838,755,Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a recently discovered class of noncoding functional RNAs encoded by metazoan genomes.
6839,755,Recent studies suggest a larger regulatory role for lncRNAs in critical biological and disease processes.
6840,755,Mounting evidence on the role of lncRNAs in regulating key processes of the immune system prompted us to hypothesize the role of lncRNAs as key regulators of the pathophysiology of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
6841,755,We used two similar approaches based on reanalysis of microarray expression datasets and curation of lncRNA-protein coding gene interactions from literature to derive support for our hypothesis.
6842,755,We also discuss potential caveats to our approach and suggest approaches to validate the hypothesis.
6843,755,Our analysis suggests the potential larger and hitherto unknown role of lncRNA regulatory networks in modulating the expression of key genes involved in the pathogenesis of SS and thereby modulating the pathophysiology of SS.
6844,756,BACKGROUND: Sjgren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease in which lymphatic cells destroy the salivary and lacrimal glands.
6845,756,Glomerulonephritis is thought to be a rare occurrence in primary Sjgren's syndrome.
6846,756,"Furthermore, concurrent glomerular involvement and lymphoma in patients with Sjgren's syndrome has seldom been reported."
6847,756,CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old woman with primary Sjgren's syndrome developed membranous glomerulonephritis and Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
6848,756,"She was diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome based on the dry eyes, dry mouth, positive anti-nuclear antibody test, anti-Ro (SS-A) antibody, salivary gland biopsy, and salivary scintigraphy."
6849,756,"Moreover, renal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of membranous glomerulonephritis."
6850,756,"Three months later, her small bowel was perforated with pneumoperitoneum, and the biopsy revealed Epstein-Barr virus-positive DLBCL."
6851,756,CONCLUSIONS: We observed the first case of primary Sjgren's syndrome associated with Epstein-Barr Virus-positive DLBCL and membranous glomerulonephritis.
6852,756,"Because of the possibility of malignancy-associated membranous glomerulonephritis in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome, we should be careful and examine such patients for hidden malignancy."
6853,757,OBJECTIVES: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) sufferers have rated chronic fatigue as the most important symptom needing improvement.
6854,757,Emerging data suggest that stimulation of the vagus nerve can modulate immunological responses.
6855,757,"The gammaCore device (electroCore), developed to stimulate the cervical vagus nerve noninvasively, was used to assess the effects of vagus nerve activation on immune responses and clinical symptoms of pSS."
6856,757,MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen female pSS subjects used the nVNS device twice daily a 26-day period.
6857,757,"At baseline, blood was drawn before and after application of the gammaCore device for 90 sec over each carotid artery."
6858,757,"The following fatigue-related outcome measures were collected at baseline, day 7 and day 28: EULAR patient reported outcome index, profile of fatigue (Pro-F), visual analogue scale of abnormal fatigue, and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS)."
6859,757,"Whole blood samples were stimulated with 2 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the supernatant levels of IFN, IL12-p70, TNF, MIP-1, IFN, IL-10, IL-1, IL-6, and IP-10 were measured at 24 hours."
6860,757,"In addition, clinical hematology and flow cytometric profiles of whole blood immune cells were analyzed."
6861,757,RESULTS: Pro-F and ESS scores were significantly reduced across all three visits.
6862,757,"LPS-stimulated production of IL-6, IL-1, IP-10, MIP-1, and TNF were significantly reduced over the study period."
6863,757,Patterns of NK- and T-cell subsets also altered significantly over the study period.
6864,757,"Interestingly, lymphocyte counts at baseline visit correlated to the reduction in fatigue score."
6865,757,CONCLUSION: The vagus nerve may play a role in the regulation of fatigue and immune responses in pSS and nVNS may reduce clinical symptoms of fatigue and sleepiness.
6866,757,"However, a sham-controlled follow-up study with a larger sample size is required to confirm the findings."
6867,758,"RATIONALE: We report a case of successful diagnosis of POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes) syndrome based on monoclonality that was confirmed by an osteosclerotic lesion biopsy in a patient without pathognomonic symptoms or monoclonal gammopathy, probably because of comorbidities, which included systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjgren syndrome."
6868,758,"PATIENT CONCERNS: A 57-year-old woman presented with an approximately 2-year history of numbness in the toes that had gradually spread, along with muscle weakness in both arms and legs."
6869,758,She had been receiving immunosuppressant and corticosteroid therapy since being diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjgren syndrome at the age of 31 years and rheumatoid arthritis at the age of 44 years.
6870,758,Neurological examination revealed predominantly distal hypoesthesia and weakness in a typical stocking-and-glove pattern.
6871,758,"Immunoelectrophoresis revealed elevated polyclonal immunoglobulin, which was attributed to her known underlying disease."
6872,758,"DIAGNOSES: Biopsy of an osteosclerotic lesion confirmed proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells, leading to a diagnosis of POEMS syndrome."
6873,758,INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: Lenalidomide therapy was started after the diagnosis and the patient had a favorable outcome.
6874,758,LESSONS: Osteosclerotic lesion biopsy can be useful for diagnosis of POEMS syndrome in difficult cases.
6875,759,Fatty infiltration in minor salivary gland biopsies and its correlation to systemic autoimmune diseases are controversial in the literature.
6876,759,Presence and extent of fatty infiltration in minor salivary glands of 107 Sjgren's syndrome patients and 67 age-matched sicca controls were compared with statistical analyses.
6877,759,No significant difference was found regarding the presence or the extent of fatty infiltration between the two groups.
6878,759,Fatty infiltration seems to be unrelated to Sjgren's syndrome thus its examination in salivary gland biopsy samples cannot improve the diagnostic accuracy of the disease.
6879,760,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Autoimmune diseases are a remarkable issue for researchers due to their adverse effects on the auditory system, but for primary Sjgrens syndrome (pSS) there is little research on the comprehensive audiological findings in literature."
6880,760,The main objective of this study was to investigate the medial olivocochlear efferent functions of subjects with pSS and to examine the audiological findings.
6881,760,MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 36 subjects with pSS and 36 healthy subjects.
6882,760,"All the subjects underwent testing including pure tone, speech, and high frequency audiometry; tympanometry and acoustic reflexes; distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE); and suppression of DPOAE."
6883,760,RESULTS: The hearing thresholds of the pSS group were higher than those of the control at all frequencies (P < 0.001).
6884,760,Minimal to mild sensorineural hearing loss was observed in 52.77% of all the subjects with pSS.
6885,760,"Additionally, all of the subjects had type A curve tympanograms, but the static compliances of the pSS group were lower and the acoustic reflex thresholds were higher than in the control (P < 0.001)."
6886,760,"In suppression levels of DPOAE, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups (P > 0.05)."
6887,760,"CONCLUSION: The study indicates that because of obtaining normal suppression levels in DPOAE, the medial olivocochlear efferent system is functional in pSS."
6888,760,"However, there is a need for more tests, including auditory brainstem response, to evaluate the afferent auditory system in pSS."
6889,761,This is a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence and causes of anemia in the primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
6890,761,One hundred and thirty-two consecutive patients with pSS were enrolled into the study.
6891,761,Standard hematological and immunological tests and examination of bone marrow were performed.
6892,761,Anemia occurred in 45 (34.1%) patients.
6893,761,"The causes of anemia included anemia of chronic disease (69%), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA, 18%), iron deficiency anemia (9%) and other causes (4%), of which AIHA caused the most severe anemia."
6894,761,"The prevalence of ANA, anti-Ro/SSA, and anti-La/SSB was much higher in patients with anemia than those without anemia."
6895,761,Anticardiolipin antibodies were most commonly detected in AIHA; the prevalence of IgG and hypocomplementemia in AIHA was much higher in patients without anemia.
6896,761,"Abnormal bone marrow changes were observed in two cases with anemia, one with morphological changes in the myeloid, megakaryocytic, and erythroid lineages and one with hypocellularity in the erythroid lineage."
6897,761,"Therefore, pSS patients with anemia may be associated with destruction of peripheral mature blood cells, impaired red cells production, and hematopoietic abnormalities due to an immune mechanism, although the concrete pathogenesis is still unclear."
6898,762,"Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel topical cyclosporin A 0.05% nanoemulsion in comparison with a conventional emulsion in primary Sjgren's syndrome dry eyes.Methods: Prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was conducted.Results: Corneal and conjunctival staining score was improved in both groups, with a faster change noted in the nanoemulsion group at 12 weeks (p < 0.05)."
6899,762,"Tear film break-up time was significantly improved in the nanoemulsion group at 12 weeks (p < 0.05), while ocular surface disease index score was improved in both groups without a difference at 12 weeks."
6900,762,Schirmer I value and goblet cell grade did not change in both groups.
6901,762,"IL-6 and MMP-9 were significantly decreased in both groups at 12 weeks.Conclusions: Both nanoemulsion and conventional cyclosporin A improved ocular signs, symptoms, and conjunctival inflammation."
6902,762,"However, the novel cyclosporin A nanoemulsion showed faster improvement of ocular surface staining scores than the conventional emulsion."
6903,763,OBJECTIVES: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder.
6904,763,Several molecular pathways and the activation of matrix metalloproteinases associated with the pathogenesis of SS participate in the initiation and progression of aortic aneurysm (AA) and aortic dissection (AD).
6905,763,"In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether patients with SS exhibit an increased risk of AA or AD."
6906,763,METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a database extracted from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database.
6907,763,"All medical conditions for each case and control were categorised using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision."
6908,763,HRs and 95% CIs for associations between SS and AA/AD were estimated using Cox regression and adjusted for comorbidities.
6909,763,RESULTS: Our analyses included 10 941 SS cases and 43764 propensity score-matched controls.
6910,763,"Compared with the controls, the patients with SS exhibited a significantly increased risk of developing an AA or AD (adjusted HR=3.642, p<0.001)."
6911,763,"Subgroup analysis revealed that compared with patients without SS, patients with primary and secondary SS both exhibited a significantly increased risk of developing AA or AD (adjusted HR=1.753, p=0.042; adjusted HR=3.693, p<0.001)."
6912,763,"CONCLUSION: Patients with SS exhibit increased risks of developing AA or AD, and healthcare professionals should be aware of this risk when treating patients with SS."
6913,763,Increased aortic surveillance may be required for patients with SS.
6914,764,"Four patients with coexistence of sarcoidosis and primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) were retrospectively analyzed.All patients were female, who were referred to our department mainly because of respiratory symptoms.Positive antinuclear antibody(ANA) was detected in 2 patients and anti-Sjgrens syndrome A (SSA) antibody positive in 1 patient.All patients presented specific histologic patterns of both sarcoidosis and pSS.Publications related to coexistence of these two diseases were reviewed.Forty-one patients were finally included in the analysis, among whom 37 confirmed patients were from literature search.There were 37 women and 4 men.The main clinical features presentation were xerophthalmia in 40, xerostomia in 38, hilaradenopathies in 28, interstitial lung disease in 15, respiratory symptoms in 13.The main immunologic data were positive ANA in 23, SSA antibody in 19, anti-Sjgrens syndrome B antibody in 10 and rheumatoid factor in 12.All patients presented specific histologic patterns of both diseases.Patients with both sarcoidosis and pSS of ten represent multisystemic involvement and positive immunologic parameters, as well as the dual expression of specific histologic characteristics."
6915,765,"OBJECTIVES: Growing evidence suggests that IL-17-producing T cells, lacking both CD4 and CD8 molecules and defined as double negative (DN) cells, play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of a number of systemic autoimmune disorders."
6916,765,"We recently demonstrated that this T-cell subset is expanded in the peripheral blood (PB) of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), produces IL-17 and accumulates in minor salivary glands (MSGs)."
6917,765,We aimed to investigate glandular and PB DN T cells in early pSS in order to verify a possible correlation with MSGs histological patterns and clinical parameters.
6918,765,METHODS: Paired samples of PB mononuclear cells and MSGs from pSS patients were evaluated at the diagnosis by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining respectively.
6919,765,"Histological analysis to identify histological scores, B/T cell segregation and the presence of germinal center (GC)-like structures was also performed."
6920,765,"RESULTS: In early stages of pSS, circulating DN T cells appear to be not yet expanded and inversely correlated with circulating CD4(+)Th17 cells."
6921,765,"The number of infiltrating DN T cells were associated with extent of glandular involvement, presence of GC-like structures and dryness symptoms and were inversely correlated with circulating DN T cells."
6922,765,CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that DN T cells are actively involved in the pathogenic mechanisms leading to glandular dysfunction and damage in pSS and may play a role in ectopic lymphoneogenesis development occurring during the disease.
6923,766,AIMS: To assess the predictive and prognostic value of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
6924,766,METHODS: This retrospective study includes 201 patients that fulfilled the 1993 European preliminary classification criteria for pSS.
6925,766,"The patients were further categorized by the 2002 revised criteria, with or without the inclusion of ANA and RF as classification criteria, and were further subgrouped by the presence of ANA, RF, anti-SS-A, and anti-SS-B, and different ANA titers."
6926,766,"The clinical manifestations, serological markers, and results of lip biopsies among these subgroups were compared."
6927,766,"RESULTS: Our results showed pSS patients who are seropositive for one of the following markers: ANA, RF, anti-SS-A, or anti-SS-B are younger, predominantly female, and had more serological abnormalities than those with seronegativity of ANA, RF, anti-SS-A, or anti-SS-B."
6928,766,"Higher ANA titers (> or = 1:640) correlated with higher frequency of serum anti-SS-A+ and anti-SS-B+, and elevations of serum immunoglobulin G and A in all three different classification criteria groups."
6929,766,The clinical manifestations and laboratory results in the 2002 revised criteria groups with or without the inclusion of ANA and RF as classification criteria items were highly concordant.
6930,766,"CONCLUSION: Regardless of the classification criteria for pSS, patients who are seropositive for one of the ANA, RF, anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B biomarkers are more likely to have autoimmune-related Sjgren's syndrome."
6931,766,ANA and RF have shown to possess the predictive and prognostic values for those who do not fulfill the higher stringent 2002 revised criteria but are indicated for immunomodulatory therapy.
6932,766,Thus we suggest that ANA and RF should be reconsidered as items of classification criteria for pSS.
6933,767,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the value of salivary gland stiffness measured by Virtual Touch quantification (VTQ; Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) for assessment of primary Sjgren syndrome."
6934,767,"METHODS: Fifty-four patients with primary Sjgren syndrome, 35 patients without primary Sjgren syndrome (patients with dry mouth and dry eye symptoms), and 52 healthy control volunteers were included in this study."
6935,767,Patients with primary Sjgren syndrome were classified as early or advanced stage by labial gland biopsies.
6936,767,"All participants underwent B-mode sonography, on which the salivary glands (parotid and submandibular) were identified and VTQ measurements of shear wave velocity (SWV) were obtained."
6937,767,The diagnostic performance of SWV was evaluated by sensitivity and specificity at the optimum cutoff point and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.
6938,767,"RESULTS: For submandibular glands, the mean SWV  SD values were 2.25  0.34 m/s in patients with early-stage primary Sjgren, 1.84  0.20 m/s in patients without primary Sjgren syndrome, and 1.82  0.27 m/s in healthy controls (P< .001)."
6939,767,"With cutoff values of 2.15 and 2.10 m/s to separate patients with early-stage primary Sjgren syndrome from those without Sjgren syndrome and healthy controls, the sensitivity and specificity were 77.1% and 85.4% and 79.2% and 83.9%, respectively."
6940,767,"For parotid glands, the SWV values were 2.78  0.82 m/s in patients with early-stage primary Sjgren syndrome, 1.93  0.33 m/s, in patients without primary Sjgren syndrome, and 1.85  0.31 m/s in healthy controls (P < .001)."
6941,767,"With cutoff values of 2.18 and 2.10 m/s to separate patients with early-stage primary Sjgren syndrome from those without Sjgren syndrome and healthy controls, the sensitivity and specificity were 89.3 % and 75.3% and 91.4% and 80.0%."
6942,767,CONCLUSIONS: The VTQ technique might be a useful noninvasive strategy for assessment of salivary glands in the early stage of primary Sjgren syndrome.
6943,768,Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that preferentially affects the optic nerves and spinal cord.
6944,768,NMO-IgG/anti-aquaporin 4 antibody (AQP4-Ab) is considered as a specific diagnostic marker for NMO.
6945,768,"A previous study using animal models passively transferred with AQP4-Ab has partially proven that NMO-IgG/AQP4-Ab has an effector function in the pathogenesis of NMO, exemplifying the diagnostic significance of this antibody."
6946,768,"Further, this marker can be used to differentiate the limited forms of NMO, such as recurrent myelitis or optic neuritis or NMO with isolated cerebral/brainstem lesions during the early course of the disease, from other diseases with a different etiology."
6947,768,"NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD) comprise these clinically heterogeneous conditions, all of which are positive for AQP4-Ab."
6948,768,"However, few patients show clinical characteristic features of NMO, without AQP4-Ab positivity."
6949,768,We should be careful to introduce interferon beta for the prevention of relapse to these seronegative but suspicious for NMO patients.
6950,768,A few NMOSD patients have also been diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or Sjogren syndrome (SjS).
6951,768,"However, there have been no reported cases of patients with SLE/SjS who do not exhibit any neurological symptoms and AQP4-Ab-positivity, and it is likely that these 2 autoimmune diseases incidentally overlap."
6952,768,"NMO might follow myasthenia gravis (MG), after thymectomy for the treatment of MG. Taken together,as in the case of other systemic autoimmune diseases,an antibody-mediated pathomechanism of NMO is suggested."
6953,769,"PURPOSE: We aimed to compare the thickness of anterior sclera, corneal layers, and pre-ocular tear film between patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome and healthy individuals."
6954,769,METHODS: Fifty-one patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome and 41 healthy control participants were recruited in this cross-sectional and comparative study.
6955,769,"The thickness of the pre-ocular tear film, corneal epithelium, Bowman's layer, stroma, Descemet's membrane, and endothelium were measured on the corneal apex."
6956,769,Anterior scleral thickness was measured at distances of 1 mm and 3 mm from the limbus.
6957,769,"The anterior segment module of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography was used to measure thicknesses of pre-ocular tear film, corneal layers, and anterior sclera."
6958,769,"RESULTS: Tear film thickness, Schirmer's test, and tear break up time values were significantly lower in the Sjgren's disease group than in the healthy controls (p<0.05)."
6959,769,The thickness measurements of corneal layers and sclera were similar between the groups.
6960,769,"Tear film thickness was moderately correlated with the Schirmer's test results (r=0.34, p=0.001), but there was no correlation between the Schirmer's test results and tear break up time (r=0.18, p=0.09)."
6961,769,"CONCLUSIONS: Pre-ocular tear film, as measured by anterior segment optical coherence tomography, was thinner in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome than in the healthy controls."
6962,769,The thicknesses of corneal layers and anterior sclera were similar between the groups.
6963,770,"BACKGROUND: Currently, feasible medical treatments are hitherto not satisfying to relieve pSS symptoms, which concerns numbers of clinical doctors."
6964,770,Acupuncture seems to be an alternative to treat pSS and conduces to good symptomatic results.
6965,770,However further research is necessary.
6966,770,"This trial is to investigate the efficacy of acupuncture on improving the key symptoms of pSS, which are dryness, pain and fatigue (DPF)."
6967,770,METHODS & DESIGN: The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial of two arms with a single centre.
6968,770,We compare acupuncture with sham acupuncture on symptomatic improvements of pSS.
6969,770,"A total of 120 pSS patients, aged at least 18, with DPF, will be randomly assigned to acupuncture or sham acupuncture groups, where they will have needle intervention for 8 weeks with 16 weeks of follow-up."
6970,770,"Subjects will be assessed each time before interventions during the 8-week intervention, in week 8 after all interventions and in week 12, 16, 20 and 24 for follow-up with different measurements."
6971,770,"The primary outcome are the proportions of subjects that have 30% or greater reduction in at least 2 out of 3 items of DPF in Numeric Analog Scale (NAS) scores (0=the best, 10=the severest), calculated between the baseline and the average scores of week 2 to 8."
6972,770,"The secondary outcome are related to individual items of NAS scores, EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), Schirmer test score and unstimulated salivary flow, serum Immunoglobulin G, A and M levels, Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), Salivary glands ultrasounds, Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale score."
6973,770,"The secondary outcome scores are to be collected at baseline, in week 8, 16, and 24."
6974,770,"Besides, individual items of NAS will also be collected in week 12 and 20."
6975,770,"Moreover, subjects' satisfaction and the proportion of the subjects who identified their allocation will also be measured and analyzed."
6976,770,DISCUSSION: This study will be the first randomized and controlled pilot trial of acupuncture on alleviating the symptoms of pSS with relatively long-term follow-up.
6977,770,The result of the study might offer a new option to treat pSS and might be a clinical proof that acupuncture has beneficial effects on pSS.
6978,770,"TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02691377 (February 20, 2016)."
6979,771,OBJECTIVE: Parotidomegaly is a criterion of the EULAR Primary Sjgren Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI).
6980,771,"The cut-off value was set at 3cm in length for the parotid gland, 2cm for the submandibular glands."
6981,771,"However, clinical appreciation of salivary glands size remains hazardous."
6982,771,"The objective is to evaluate inter-observer reproducibility of parotid gland measurement by palpation, and to secondary evaluate its reliability compared to US assessment."
6983,771,"METHODS: Outpatients with primary Sjgren Syndrome (pSS) or with a diagnostic suspicion, in a single reference centre, were included."
6984,771,"They underwent clinical examination by two independent investigators (VDP and DC), evaluating: parotid gland swelling, parotid gland size (direct measurement with a decameter under the mandibular angle), and pain."
6985,771,"Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated to determine inter-observer concordance for parotid gland swelling, and intraclass correlation coefficient to determine inter-observer agreement of gland size measurement."
6986,771,"RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (33 women, 1 man) were included."
6987,771,Clinical data were complete for 33 patients.
6988,771,Inter-observer concordance Kappa coefficient was 0.90 [0.76-1.00] for detection of parotidomegaly over 66 parotid glands.
6989,771,It was of 0.60 [0.42-0.73] for gland length measurement.
6990,771,"For one observer, the median cut-off for defining parotidomegaly was 4.15cm; for the second observer, it was of 4.92cm."
6991,771,"For submandibular glands palpation, no correlation was found between investigators."
6992,771,A significant association between clinical parotidomegaly and a larger echographic surface was found.
6993,771,CONCLUSION: Clinical measurement of parotidomegaly was concordant between two observers on a binary mode (presence/absence).
6994,771,"However, concordance on direct measurement was weak."
6995,771,US could be a complementary examination.
6996,772,"To evaluate the efficacy of a thermo-sensitive punctum plug, (SmartPlug) in Primary Sjogren's Syndrome (pSS) patients with dry eyes, whose symptoms persist despite preservative-free artificial tear treatment."
6997,772,"In this study, 22 Primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS), as defined by American-European Consensus Group Classification Criteria."
6998,772,All patients being followed up by Ege University Departments of Rheumatology and Ophthalmology.
6999,772,The patients had positive Schirmer test results (<5 mm without anesthesia).
7000,772,"SmartPlug (Medennium, Irvine, California, USA) was inserted into the inferior lacrimal canaliculi of both eyes."
7001,772,"Visual acuity measurements, Schirmer I test measurements, lissamine green staining scores, and tear-film breakup times (BUT) were noted before plug insertion and at the 1st, 6th, and 12th months following the procedure."
7002,772,Minimum follow-up period was 6 months for 19 patients and 12 months for 16 patients.
7003,772,"Significant improvements were seen in the Schirmer I test scores (before insertion: 1.98  2.67; 1st month: 5.68  6.69; 6th month: 5.35  5.38; 12th month 6.43  5.14 P = 0.006), tear-film BUT in seconds (before insertion: 4.64  3.7; 1st month: 5.80  2.36; 6th month: 7.53  2.92; 12th month 7.50  2.52, P < 0.0001), respectively."
7004,772,"Thermodynamic punctum plug insertion only in inferior canaliculus is a simple, effective, and comfortable option for treatment of severe aqueous tear deficiency that cannot be controlled using preservative-free tears."
7005,773,"BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis and Sjgren's syndrome are two different diseases; however, when affecting the salivary glands, both diseases exhibit similar clinical signs and symptoms, which often complicates the diagnosis."
7006,773,The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of using salivary electrophoresis to differentiate between the two diseases.
7007,773,METHODS: Saliva was collected from patients with sarcoidosis and patients with Sjgren's syndrome.
7008,773,"Salivary flow rate, total protein, and electrophoretic profiles were examined."
7009,773,"RESULTS: Mean salivary flow rate was 0.410.07ml/min/gland vs. 0.430.07ml/min/gland; total salivary protein was 130.029.2mg% vs. 104.08.8mg% for sarcoidosis vs. Sjgren's syndrome, respectively."
7010,773,"No differences were observed in salivary flow rate, total salivary protein, or electrophoretic profile between patients with sarcoidosis and patients with Sjgren's syndrome (P=0.768, 0.718, and 1.000, respectively)."
7011,773,CONCLUSIONS: Salivary protein electrophoresis does not appear to be useful to differentiate between sarcoidosis and Sjgren's syndrome.
7012,774,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the epidemiology of Sjgren's syndrome (SS), including prevalence, disease type, extra-glandular involvement, satisfaction of diagnostic criteria sets, and treatment used in Japan."
7013,774,"METHODS: The Research Team for Autoimmune Diseases, the Research Program for Intractable Disease by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare conducted primary and secondary surveys on epidemiology of SS in 2011."
7014,774,"The primary survey covered 4,729 out of 14,095 Japan-wide Hospital Departments to investigate the prevalence of SS."
7015,774,"The secondary survey encompassed 214 Hospital Departments that agreed to the survey, to characterize disease type, extra-glandular involvement, satisfaction of diagnostic criteria sets, and treatments."
7016,774,"RESULTS: The number of patients with SS in Japan estimated by the primary survey was 68,483."
7017,774,"The secondary survey involving data collected from 2,195 SS patients from 98 Hospital Departments showed that the mean age of patients was 60.8  15.2 years, male/female ratio was 1/17.4, primary/secondary SS was about 60%/40% and glandular/extra-glandular form in primary SS was about 70%/25%."
7018,774,"The satisfaction rate was 53.8% for the 1999 revised Japanese Ministry of Health criteria for the diagnosis of SS, 47.7% for the 2002 American-European Consensus Group classification criteria for SS and 49.6% for 2012 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SS."
7019,774,"Corticosteroids were used by 752 of 2,195 patients (34%), immunosuppressants by 358 patients (16%), biologics by 68 patients (3%) and secretagogues by 695 patients (32%)."
7020,774,"CONCLUSION: The surveys provided valuable information on the epidemiology of SS including prevalence, disease type, extra-glandular involvement, satisfaction of diagnostic criteria sets and treatments used today in Japan."
7021,775,Sjgren's syndrome is defined as an autoimmune disease characterized by a progressive sicca syndrome associated with anti-SSA or SSA positivity and/or significant infiltrate at minor salivary gland biopsy.
7022,775,"This autoimmune disease is relatively frequent, with a clinical diagnosis among women after the 5 decade."
7023,775,"Its physiopathology, complex, associates the intervention of both environmental and genetic factors."
7024,775,"Salivary epithelial cell is at the center of the pathological immune response of primary Sjgren's syndrome, characterized by a chronic B cell polyclonal activation potentially leading to the development of B cell lymphoma."
7025,776,"A 47-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosed at age of 35 years was admitted for dyspnoea, substernal chest pain, dry mucosas and difficulty in swallowing."
7026,776,Physical examination revealed vesicular breath sounds bilaterally.
7027,776,"Laboratory work showed antinuclear antibody (ANA) (speckled pattern, 1:40), positive anti-Sjogren's syndrome antigen (SSA) and antisingle side band (SSB) and negative double-strand DNA (dsDNA), with normal C3,C4,C50."
7028,776,A high-resolution chest CT scan demonstrated multiple bronchial cysts and diffuse interstitial infiltrates.
7029,776,Surgical lung biopsy revealed emphysematous changes and mild lymphocytic infiltrate around the bronchioles compatible with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia diagnosis.
7030,776,This case illustrates a patient with primary SLE overlapped by initial manifestations of secondary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) presenting with associated autoimmune interstitial lung disease.
7031,776,"Antibody markers, high-resolution chest CT scan and surgical lung biopsy were essential in evaluating this patient, confirming the interstitial lymphocytic infiltration of the lung."
7032,776,Primary SS (pSS) is the most commonly associated disease to lung interstitial pneumonia (LIP) (25%).
7033,776,"High-resolution chest CT scan demonstrates areas of ground-glass attenuation, suggestive of interstitial disease."
7034,776,Surgical lung biopsy shows pathologic increase of mature lymphocyte cells and histiocytes.
7035,776,Most of the cases have a benign presentation and shortly relapse.
7036,776,"Superimposed infection, pulmonary fibrosis and lymphoma develop in less than 20% of cases."
7037,776,Corticosteroids are the primary therapy.
7038,776,"While pSS is commonly associated with interstitial lung involvement, secondary Sjogren's syndrome (sSS) is only rare."
7039,776,"It has been described the initial sSS presentation by Sica symptoms development only, and our case is the first report of LIP presentation as initial manifestation of sSS."
7040,776,Our patient remained stable after corticosteroids and hydoxychloroquine therapy and no progression of disease after 6 months follow-up.
7041,777,Several new technologies are providing useful diagnostic tools and new information related to the pathogenesis of certain oral diseases.
7042,777,"In this review, we describe several of these technologies including gene and microRNA arrays, proteomics, and antigen arrays as they relate to the study of Sjgren's syndrome and head and neck cancer."
7043,777,"A common theme is the systematic analysis of large-scale inventories of RNAs, proteins, and autoantibody biomarkers revealing information not previously recognized."
7044,777,We also discuss metagenomic approaches that characterize the many different microorganisms present in the oral cavity that may impact oral and human health.
7045,777,"Lastly, we describe applications of a new type of antibody-profiling technology termed Luciferase Immunoprecipitation Systems (LIPS), which has a wide dynamic range of detection of both linear and conformational epitopes needed for optimum diagnostics and biomarker discovery."
7046,777,"We propose that the information offered by these technologies will enhance our ability to diagnose, treat, and further understand the pathogenesis of multiple oral diseases."
7047,778,Renal involvement in Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is not uncommon and may precede other complaints.
7048,778,"Tubulointerstitial nephritis is the most common renal disease in SS and may lead to renal tubular acidosis (RTA), which in turn may cause osteomalacia."
7049,778,"Nevertheless, osteomalacia rarely occurs as the first manifestation of a renal tubule disorder due to SS."
7050,778,"We herewith describe a 43-year-old woman who was admitted to our hospital for weakness, lumbago and inability to walk."
7051,778,X-ray of the long bones showed extensive demineralization of the bones.
7052,778,"Laboratory investigations revealed chronic kidney disease with serum creatinine of 2.3 mg/dL and creatinine clearance of 40 mL/min, hypokalemia (3.2 mmol/L), hypophosphatemia (0.4 mmol/L), hypocalcemia (2.14 mmol/L) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (chlorine: 114 mmol/L; alkaline reserve: 14 mmol/L)."
7053,778,The serum alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated.
7054,778,"The serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D were low and borderline low, respectively, and the parathyroid hormone level was 70 pg/L."
7055,778,"Urinalysis showed inappropriate alkaline urine (urinary PH: 7), glycosuria with normal blood glucose, phosphaturia and uricosuria."
7056,778,These values indicated the presence of both distal and proximal RTA.
7057,778,Our patient reported dryness of the mouth and eyes and Schirmer's test showed xerophthalmia.
7058,778,An accessory salivary gland biopsy showed changes corresponding to stage IV of Chisholm and Masson score.
7059,778,Kidney biopsy showed diffuse and severe tubulo-interstitial nephritis with dense lymphoplasmocyte infiltrates.
7060,778,Sicca syndrome and renal interstitial infiltrates indicated SS as the underlying cause of the RTA and osteomalacia.
7061,778,"The patient received alkalinization, vitamin D (Sterogyl ), calcium supplements and steroids in an initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day, tapered to 10 mg daily."
7062,778,"The prognosis was favorable and the serum creatinine level was 1.7 mg/dL, calcium was 2.2 mmol/L and serum phosphate was 0.9 mmol/L."
7063,779,Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) is a rare systemic autoimmune disease which is sometimes found in association with other autoimmune disorders including Sjogren's syndrome.
7064,779,"Neurological manifestations occur in 20% to 25% of diagnosed cases of Sjgren's syndrome; however, less than 5% of patients with Sjgren's syndrome have neurological manifestations as the initial presenting feature of Sjgren's syndrome."
7065,779,We report the case of an elderly female with longitudinal myelitis as a presenting feature who had positive antibody to aquaporin-4 (NMO-IgG) and Sjgren's syndrome.
7066,780,BACKGROUND: With the development of modern therapies and better care of patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs) increased survival has been achieved.
7067,780,"However, ARDs may share an association with risk of lymphomas and solid tumors."
7068,780,"The increased cancer risk in these patients is mainly due to high inflammatory activity and severity of disease, rather than the immunosuppressive therapy."
7069,780,PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the coexistence or later development of cancer with ARDs in a retrospective audit of a reference university hospital and critically reviewed published literature.
7070,780,"Fourteen out of 1,730 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Sjogren's syndrome (SS) followed-up at the University Hospital of Ioannina over the last 33 years developed secondary malignancies, both solid tumors and lymphomas."
7071,780,RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The most frequent cancer associated with ARDs is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
7072,780,The average risk of lymphoma in RA may be composed of a markedly increased risk in patients with most severe disease.
7073,780,Solid tumors were presented mainly in RA patients and renal cell carcinoma was the most frequently found.
7074,781,OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an international set of classification criteria for primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) using guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).
7075,781,These criteria were developed for use in individuals with signs and/or symptoms suggestive of SS.
7076,781,"METHODS: We assigned preliminary importance weights to a consensus list of candidate criteria items, using multi-criteria decision analysis."
7077,781,"We tested and adapted the resulting draft criteria using existing cohort data on primary SS cases and non-SS controls, with case/non-case status derived from expert clinical judgment."
7078,781,We then validated the performance of the classification criteria in a separate cohort of patients.
7079,781,"RESULTS: The final classification criteria are based on the weighted sum of 5 items: anti-SSA/Ro antibody positivity and focal lymphocytic sialadenitis with a focus score of 1 foci/4 mm(2) , each scoring 3; an abnormal ocular staining score of 5 (or van Bijsterveld score of 4), a Schirmer's test result of 5 mm/5 minutes, and an unstimulated salivary flow rate of 0.1 ml/minute, each scoring 1."
7080,781,Individuals with signs and/or symptoms suggestive of SS who have a total score of 4 for the above items meet the criteria for primary SS.
7081,781,"Sensitivity and specificity against clinician-expert-derived case/non-case status in the final validation cohort were high, i.e., 96% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 92-98%) and 95% (95% CI 92-97%), respectively."
7082,781,"CONCLUSION: Using methodology consistent with other recent ACR/EULAR-approved classification criteria, we developed a single set of data-driven consensus classification criteria for primary SS, which performed well in validation analyses and are well-suited as criteria for enrollment in clinical trials."
7083,782,"AIM: To examine the prevalence of sicca symptoms and secondary Sjgren's syndrome (sSS) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and the impact of sSS on disease activity and treatment profile in RA patients."
7084,782,"METHODS: Three hundred and seven RA patients responding positive to at least one of the questions in a questionnaire about sicca symptoms, were examined by Schirmer I test for tear production, and unstimulated whole saliva collection (USWC)."
7085,782,"Secondary Sjgren's syndrome was defined by at least one subjective sicca symptom, in addition to a positive Schirmer I test and positive USWC."
7086,782,"RESULTS: Among the 307 RA patients, 86 (28%) responded positive to at least one question about sicca symptoms, and 11 patients were positive for both Schirmer I and USWC tests, giving a minimum prevalence of sSS at 3.6%."
7087,782,"There were no differences in RA patients with and without sSS regarding age, sex, disease duration, disease activity score (DAS-28) and seropositivity for anti-cyclic citrullinated protein."
7088,782,RA patients with sSS had a tendency for higher numbers of tender and swollen joints and pain.
7089,782,"None of the RA patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors had sSS, compared to 22% of the rest of the RA population studied."
7090,782,The treatment of the RA patients with and without sSS was not different.
7091,782,"CONCLUSION: Among the 307 RA patients, 28% had at least one sicca symptom."
7092,782,The estimated minimum of prevalence of sSS in 307 RA patients was 3.6%.
7093,782,Secondary Sjgren's syndrome was not found in RA patients treated with biologics such as TNF blockers.
7094,783,BACKGROUND: Symptoms in keeping with autonomic dysfunction are commonly described by primary Sjgrens syndrome patients (pSS); whether objective abnormalities of autonomic function occur is unclear.
7095,783,This study set out to explore dynamic cardiovascular autonomic responses in pSS and their relationship with symptoms and quality of life.
7096,783,"METHODS: Twenty-one people from the UK pSS registry, 21 community controls and 21 patients with the autoimmune liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (matched case-wise for age and sex) attended for assessment of autonomic responses to orthostasis and Valsalva manoeuvre (VM)."
7097,783,"pSS patients also completed EULAR Sjgrens Syndrome patient-reported index (ESSPRI), EULAR Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI), fatigue impact scale and EURO-QOL 5-dimension (EQ-5D)."
7098,783,"RESULTS: Compared with controls, pSS patients had significantly lower baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) (114  13 vs. 127  20; P = 0.02), which dropped to a significantly lower value (98  22 vs. 119  24, P = 0.009)."
7099,783,"When area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for when the SBP was below baseline this was significantly greater in pSS compared to both control groups (pSS vs. control vs. PBC: 153  236 vs. 92  85 vs. 1.2  0.3, P = 0.005)."
7100,783,Peak phase IV SBP during the VM was significantly lower in pSS (P = 0.007) indicating early sympathetic failure.
7101,783,Increased heart rate associated with fatigue (P = 0.02; r(2) = 0.2) and EQ-5D.
7102,783,"A shift in sympathetic-vagal balance associated with overall symptom burden (ESSPRI) (P = 0.04, r(2) = 0.3) and EULAR sicca score (P = 0.016; r(2) = 0.3), the latter also correlated with baroreceptor effectiveness (P = 0.03; r(2) = 0.2) and diastolic blood pressure variability (P = 0.003; r(2) = 0.4)."
7103,783,CONCLUSION: pSS patients have impaired blood pressure response to standing.
7104,783,Dysautonomia correlates with PSS-associated symptoms and quality of life.
7105,784,Pigmented cosmetic dermatitis-like (Riehl's melanosis-like) pigmentation was reported in three of 27 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome.
7106,784,But case reports of such eruptions are rare.
7107,784,We describe three cases of such eruptions associated with primary Sjgren's syndrome or anti-SSA antibody and possible associations with specific types of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and infiltrating lymphocytes.
7108,784,"These middle-aged Japanese women had reticular facial pigmentation and histopathological examination revealed interface dermatitis, melanophages, and dense lymphocytic infiltration around hair follicles and sweat ducts."
7109,784,"HLA typing revealed common antigenic equivalents or genetic typing of HLA-A2, DR52, DPA1(02:02) and DPB1(05:01)."
7110,784,Immunohistochemical staining revealed major subsets of T cells to be CD8 and CD45RO.
7111,784,Some Foxp3- and few IL17-positive cells were found in strong contrast to the major CD4 subset of infiltrated T cells in annular erythema associated with Sjgren's syndrome.
7112,784,"Apparently, our patients' pigmentation represented a specific etiology associated with primary Sjgren's syndrome or anti-SSA antibody."
7113,785,Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe complication and leading cause of mortality in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS).
7114,785,This study was to investigate the overall survival rates and the utility of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) as a potential prognostic factor of pSS-PAH.
7115,785,This cohort study retrospectively enrolled 55 patients with pSS-PAH who were followed up at the Department of Rheumatology of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) between August 2007 and May 2017.
7116,785,The patients were stratified according to the level of RDW (15.0 and >15.0%).
7117,785,"Baseline demographics, laboratory results, pulmonary function conditions, hemodynamic assessments, and treatment regimens were analyzed."
7118,785,Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify whether RDW level is a factor related to adverse outcome.
7119,785,"A total of 55 patients were recruited, with an average age of 38.99.3years."
7120,785,"Fifty-four were female (98.2%), and the average duration at the time of PAH diagnosis was 25.533.2months."
7121,785,"Higher RDW levels were found in patients who deceased in follow-up (13.82.6 vs 16.51.6%, p=0.003) and with higher NYHA classes (13.81.8 vs 16.52.9%, p<0.001)."
7122,785,Patients with RDW>15% had a significantly worse overall survival than patients with RDW15% (3-year survival rate 59.5 vs. 88.7% log-rank p=0.015).
7123,785,"Cox regression analysis identified RDW>15% as a prognostic factor for adverse outcome (HR 1.786, 95% CI 1.137-2.803, p=0.012)."
7124,785,RDW can serve as a potential negative prognostic factor of pSS-PAH.
7125,786,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of a rapid point-of-care diagnostic test to detect elevated matrix metalloproteinase 9 levels (InflammaDry)."
7126,786,"METHODS: In a prospective, sequential, masked, multicenter clinical trial, InflammaDry was performed on 206 patients: 143 patients with clinical signs and symptoms of dysfunctional tear syndrome (dry eyes) and 63 healthy individuals serving as controls."
7127,786,"Participants were assessed as healthy controls or for a clinical diagnosis of dry eye using the Ocular Surface Disease Index, Schirmer tear test, tear breakup time, and keratoconjunctival staining."
7128,786,MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The sensitivity and specificity of InflammaDry were compared with clinical assessment.
7129,786,"RESULTS: InflammaDry showed sensitivity of 85% (in 121 of 143 patients), specificity of 94% (59 of 63), negative predictive value of 73% (59 of 81), and positive predictive value of 97% (121 of 125)."
7130,786,"CONCLUSION: Compared with clinical assessment, InflammaDry is sensitive and specific in diagnosing dry eye."
7131,786,APPLICATION TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Dry eye is often underdiagnosed resulting from poor communication between the clinical assessment of dry eye severity between clinicians and patients.
7132,786,This often leads to a lack of effective treatment.
7133,786,Matrix metalloproteinase 9 is an inflammatory biomarker that has been shown to be elevated in the tears of patients with dry eyes.
7134,786,"The ability to accurately detect elevated matrix metalloproteinase 9 levels may lead to earlier diagnosis, more appropriate treatment, and better management of ocular surface disease."
7135,786,"Preoperative and perioperative management of inflammation related to dry eyes may reduce dry eyes that develop after laser in situ keratomileusis, improve wound healing, and reduce flap complications."
7136,786,Recognition of inflammation may allow for targeted perioperative therapeutic management of care for patients who undergo cataract and refractive surgery and improve outcomes.
7137,786,TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01313351.
7138,787,A 54-year-old woman diagnosed with primary Sjgren's syndrome in 2007 presented with a 1-year history of visual hallucinations requiring admission to a psychiatric unit.
7139,787,The hallucinations resolved while on olanzapine and hydroxychloroquine but recurred when they were stopped.
7140,787,"Despite restarting olanzapine, her visual hallucinations persisted."
7141,787,"When she started a tapering dose of prednisolone, all the hallucinations resolved."
7142,787,This report adds to the small literature on psychiatric manifestations of Sjgren's syndrome and provides evidence that low-dose corticosteroids may be an effective treatment for this manifestation.
7143,788,Transverse myelitis is a rare focal inflammation of the spinal cord.
7144,788,"Multiple etiologies have been identified including autoimmune diseases, mainly systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjgren' syndrome."
7145,788,"It can occur in an acute or subacute clinical onset, with the acute presentation having a worse prognosis."
7146,788,An early diagnosis and intensive treatment are important features recommended in these patients.
7147,788,We present three cases with transverse myelitis associated with autoimmune diseases.
7148,788,"We discuss different clinical manifestations, association with autoantobodies, radiologic findings, and therapeutic and prognostic issues."
7149,789,"BACKGROUND/AIM: We aimed to analyze the value of 3 serial sections, spaced 200mapart,for quantification of lymphocyte and plasma cell foci inminor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB)."
7150,789,MATERIALS AND METHODS: Labial MSGBs from 69 patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and scleroderma were used for this study.
7151,789,"Each sample was prepared as 3 serial sections spaced 200m apart.Lymphocytic and plasma cell focus score (LFS, PFS) were determined for each section, and the diagnostic results were compared to those obtained from a single section."
7152,789,"RESULTS: For 22 of the 69 patients, all 3 sectionswere scored at<1 and interpreted as inconclusive for the presence of SS."
7153,789,"For 20 cases, all 3 sectionswere scored at1 and interpreted as diagnostic for SS."
7154,789,"In the remaining 27 cases, the score was found to vary between sections.Plasma cell foci were observed in 11 cases, with 5 cases exhibiting a PFSof 1."
7155,789,"Of those 5 cases, 4 also had a LFSof 1."
7156,789,CONCLUSION: Assessment of 3 serial sections in MSGB has the potential to improve accuracy of SS diagnosis by detecting specific features that may not have been detected in a single section.We concluded that data about the PFS require further evaluation.
7157,790,OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the prevalence of patients with either primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and positive anticentromere antibodies (ACA) and secondary Sjgren's syndrome (sSS) and limited cutaneous ACA positive-systemic sclerosis (SSc) in two large cohorts of patients with pSS and SSc and also to compare the clinical features of these two subsets with those of patients affected by 'ACA-positive SSc without sicca symptoms' and 'pSS'.
7158,790,"METHODS: In this retrospective monocentric study, the case records of 'overlap' patients fulfilling both the classification criteria for SS and the LeRoy criteria for early SSc were identified from two datasets of patients with limited cutaneous ACA positive SSc (209 subjects) and with pSS (402 subjects) who attended our Rheumatology Unit in the years between 1989 and 2011."
7159,790,Control groups were represented by SSc subjects without sicca symptoms ('SSc group') and ACA negative Pss patients ('pSS group').
7160,790,SSc patients with sicca symptoms ('Sicca-SSc group') who did not complete the diagnostic algorithm for SS were excluded from the analysis.
7161,790,"Demographic, clinical and immunological data of the patients enrolled were collected cumulatively over the entire follow up period."
7162,790,"Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA)."
7163,790,RESULTS: Out of the two datasets 41 'overlap' patients were selected.
7164,790,The control groups were represented by 102/209 SSc subjects without sicca symptoms ('SSc group') and 387/402 pSS patients ('pSS group').
7165,790,Eighty-one 'sicca-SSc' with an incomplete work-up for SS were excluded from the analysis.
7166,790,"The prevalence of ACA positive pSS patients among pSS was 3.7% (15/402), while the frequency of patients with definite sSS in the SSc cohort was 20% (26/128)."
7167,790,"No differences were detected between 'overlap' patients and control groups, relatively to demographic characteristics."
7168,790,'Overlap patients' were characterised by a milder SSc disease (i.e.
7169,790,"lower frequency of sclerodactily, negative evolution of the capillaroscopy pattern or absence of severe systemic involvement) whereas, as far as the SS-related manifestations were concerned, although often lacking in specific autoantibodies (i.e."
7170,790,"rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB), the 'overlap patients' displayed a full blown SS phenotype with recurrent salivary gland enlargement, purpura, fatigue, arthralgias, and leukocytopenia."
7171,790,It is noteworthy that the prevalence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the 'overlap patients' was higher than in pSS.
7172,790,"CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results of our work emphasise the existence of a novel distinct clinical entity which might tentatively be called 'ACA-positive limited scleroderma/SS overlap syndrome' characterised by a benign SSc clinical course but at a high risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."
7173,791,OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and to identify its predictors among various clinical parameters.
7174,791,METHODS: The EuroQoL-5 dimension (EQ-5D) was used to measure the patients' HRQoL.
7175,791,The utility values of 178 patients with pSS enrolled in a prospective pSS cohort in Korea were analysed and compared with the Korean normative data.
7176,791,The associations among the clinical parameters and utility values were evaluated.
7177,791,"RESULTS: The mean utility value of the pSS patients was significantly lower than that of the Korean general population (0.7730.138 vs. 0.9440.095, p<0.001)."
7178,791,"The proportion of patients with problems in the 4 dimensions was significantly higher in the pSS patients than in the general population (anxiety/depression 70.2 vs. 24.2%, pain 78.7 vs. 28.8%, usual activities 37.6 vs. 9.8%, and mobility 40.4 vs. 12.5%, p<0.001)."
7179,791,"Bivariate correlation analyses revealed that the degree of pain, fatigue, and patient global assessment of the disease was positively correlated with the utility value."
7180,791,"The xerostomia inventory score, ocular surface disease index, and the EULAR Sjgren's syndrome patient-reported index (ESSPRI) also correlated with the utility value."
7181,791,"On multiple regression analysis, only the ESSPRI remained in the model after stepwise selection adjusted for age and sex (coefficient  =-0.053, p<0.001)."
7182,791,"CONCLUSIONS: The HRQoL of pSS patients is significantly lower than that of the general population, and the ESSPRI is an independent predictor of the HRQoL in pSS patients."
7183,792,Saliva is a complex fluid consisting of secretions from the major and minor salivary glands.
7184,792,Gland-specific saliva can be used to diagnose any pathology from the specific major salivary gland.
7185,792,Whole saliva has serum constituents that are derived from the local vasculature of the salivary glands and gingival crevicular fluid.
7186,792,"Saliva, as a diagnostic fluid, has distinctive advantages over serum as whole saliva can be collected non-invasively by individuals with limited training using simple equipments."
7187,792,This review aimed to explore the diagnostic applications of saliva in systemic and oral diseases.
7188,792,Analysis of saliva can offer a cost-effective approach to screen for a larger population.
7189,792,"Salivary analysis may be useful for diagnosing systemic oral disorders, as well as for monitoring hormone and therapeutic levels of drug."
7190,793,We presented the first case of bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis secondary to Sjgren's syndrome.
7191,793,"Further consideration should be given to the association between Sjgren's syndrome and bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis, because Sjgren's syndrome is latent, but more frequent than other autoimmune diseases."
7192,794,"OBJECTIVES: Pain is a major factor in health quality in Sjgren's syndrome (SS), but little is known about the factors that contribute to pain severity."
7193,794,"Because pain perception has been linked to catastrophizing in other diseases, we assessed subjects with primary SS (pSS) to explore a possible link between pain, illness appraisal, and catastrophizing."
7194,794,"METHOD: A total of 92 subjects who met American-European consensus criteria for the diagnosis of pSS completed a questionnaire that included health history, medication use, illness perceptions, pain severity, mood, fatigue, pain anxiety, and pain catastrophizing."
7195,794,Linear regression was used to test the effect of each variable on pain severity.
7196,794,Multivariate models were constructed using backwards elimination to assess the significant predictors of pain severity.
7197,794,"RESULTS: From linear regression analysis, catastrophizing was more strongly predictive of pain severity than age, fatigue, depression, or anxiety in both seropositive and seronegative pSS patients."
7198,794,"In the multivariate model identified using backwards selection, four variables (pain catastrophizing, fibromyalgia status, serological status, and the conviction that illness would have severe consequences) predicted 55% of the variance in pain severity."
7199,794,CONCLUSIONS: Pain catastrophizing was a significant predictor of pain severity in both seropositive and seronegative pSS patients.
7200,794,This study suggests that behavioural interventions designed to reduce pain catastrophizing and negative appraisal of illness could be of benefit in pSS patients.
7201,794,"Research is needed to test the effect of psycho-educational therapies on key patient-reported outcomes, particularly pain, depression, and fatigue, in pSS."
7202,795,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by periepithelial lymphocytic infiltrates in affected tissues and the production of plethora of autoantibodies.
7203,795,Among them autoimmune responses against Ro/SSA and La/SSB are of major importance since their detection is routinely used for disease diagnosis and clinical characterization.
7204,795,"Although the exact mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis are not fully understood, the important role of salivary gland epithelial cells (SGEC) in the initiation and development of the local immune responses is well-established."
7205,795,SGECs are also capable to mediate the exposure of the Ro/SSA and La/SSB autoantigens to the immune system by elevated apoptosis and autoantigen release in apoptotic bodies and/or by the secretion of autoantigen-containing exosomes.
7206,795,The expression of these autoantigens in epithelial cells appears to be tightly regulated.
7207,795,"Up-to-date, signaling of certain innate immunity receptors, such as TLR3, appear to be implicated in the regulation of Ro/SSA and La/SSB expression by SGECs, whereas the deregulated expression of certain miRNAs that are predicted to target them in SS patients suggests a regulatory feedback at the post-transcriptional level."
7208,795,"In the periphery, the humoral autoimmune responses are further regulated by the development of an active network of idiotypic-antiidiotypic antibodies."
7209,795,The plethora of mechanisms suggests that autoimmune humoral responses in SS are tightly regulated.
7210,795,"In this review, the major humoral autoimmune responses, recent advances on the role of epithelial cells in their development, as well as possible regulatory mechanisms will be discussed."
7211,796,OBJECTIVE: Determine the presence and assess the extent of fatty infiltration of the minor salivary glands (SG) of primary SS patients (pSS) as compared to those with non-SS sicca (nSS).
7212,796,METHODS: Minor SG biopsy samples from 134 subjects with pSS (n=72) or nSS (n=62) were imaged.
7213,796,"Total area and fatty replacement area for each glandular cross-section (n=4-6 cross-sections per subject) were measured using Image J (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD)."
7214,796,The observer was blinded to subject classification status.
7215,796,"The average area of fatty infiltration calculated per subject was evaluated by logistic regression and general linearized models (GLM) to assess relationships between fatty infiltration and clinical exam results, extent of fibrosis and age."
7216,796,RESULTS: The average area of fatty infiltration for subjects with pSS (median% (range) 4.97 (0.05-30.2)) was not significantly different from that of those with nSS (3.75 (0.087-41.9).
7217,796,"Infiltration severity varied widely, and subjects with fatty replacement greater than 6% were equivalently distributed between pSS and nSS participants ((2) p=.50)."
7218,796,Age accounted for all apparent relationships between fatty infiltration and fibrosis or reduced saliva flow.
7219,796,"The all-inclusive GLM for prediction of pSS versus non-SS classification including fibrosis, age, fatty replacement, and focus score was not significantly different from any desaturated model."
7220,796,In no iteration of the model did fatty replacement exert a significant effect on the capacity to predict pSS classification.
7221,796,CONCLUSIONS: Fatty infiltration is an age-associated phenomenon and not a selective feature of Sjgren's syndrome.
7222,796,Sicca patients who do not fulfil pSS criteria have similar rates of fatty infiltration of the minor SG.
7223,797,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease, affecting predominantly the exocrine glands, a large array of systemic manifestations and high risk of lymphoma development."
7224,797,The latter constitutes the major adverse outcome of SS contributing in the increased morbidity and mortality of the disease.
7225,797,"The vast majority of lymphomas in SS are B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), primarily indolent mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, followed by nodal marginal zone lymphomas (NMZL) and diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL)."
7226,797,"In the last 3 decades and due to the adverse impact of NHL in disease outcome, an effort has been undertaken to identify markers and models predicting patients with SS at high risk for lymphoma development."
7227,797,"Several epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and histological parameters, some of which are evident at the time of SS diagnosis, were proved to independently predict the development of NHL."
7228,797,"These include salivary gland enlargement, skin vasculitis/purpura, glomerulonephritis, peripheral neuropathy, Raynaud's phenomenon, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hypocomplementemia, cryoglobulinemia, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro/La autoantibodies, hypergammaglobulinemia, serum monoclonal gammopathy, biopsy focus score and organization of lymphocytic infiltrates in the salivary glands into ectopic germinal centers."
7229,797,Prediction models combining some of the afore-mentioned predictors have also been described.
7230,797,"However, the identification of specific and sensitive molecular biomarkers, related to the process of lymphomagenesis is still pending."
7231,797,"Recently, we described a novel biomarker the miR200b-5p micro-RNA."
7232,797,"Low levels of this miRNA in the minor salivary glands, appears to discriminate with high specificity and sensitivity the SS patients who have from those who do not have NHL."
7233,797,"miR200b-5p, being expressed years before the clinical onset of NHL, independently predicts NHL development with a predictive value higher than the previously published multifactorial models and has a possible role in the monitoring of therapeutic response."
7234,797,"Thus, it is a strong candidate for the identification and follow-up of patients at risk."
7235,798,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis measured by means of pulse wave velocity (PWV) in women with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) versus a healthy age- and sex-matched control group, and to identify factors independently associated with PWV in primary SS."
7236,798,METHODS: Forty-four women with primary SS and 78 age-matched healthy women without overt cardiovascular (CV) diseases were assessed for traditional and nontraditional CV risk factors.
7237,798,PWV was also performed.
7238,798,A linear regression analysis was used to identify factors independently associated with PWV in primary SS.
7239,798,"RESULTS: Women with primary SS had significantly higher PWV than controls (P = 0.030), and the frequency of increased PWV was significantly higher in this group (25% versus 8%; P = 0.013)."
7240,798,The proportion of patients ages 50 years (ratio 4.6) with increased PWV was almost 2-fold higher than those ages >50 years (ratio 2.4) with respect to controls.
7241,798,Positivity for anti-SSB was more frequent in patients with normal PWV than in those with increased PWV (61% versus 18%; P = 0.034).
7242,798,Women with primary SS and increased PWV had lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D; P = 0.047) than primary SS patients with normal PWV.
7243,798,"In addition, 25(OH)D levels tended to correlate inversely with PWV in women with primary SS (P = 0.067), but not in controls (P = 0.97)."
7244,798,"In multivariate analysis, the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and Sjgren's Syndrome Damage Index emerged as factors independently correlated with PWV."
7245,798,"CONCLUSION: Women with primary SS had higher PWV than controls, but a similar FRS."
7246,798,The FRS and chronic damage were found to be independently associated with PWV.
7247,799,BACKGROUND: Cystic lung disease (CLD) in Sjgren syndrome (SS) is a condition with unclearprognostic implications.
7248,799,"Our objectives in this study are to determine its frequency, progression over time, and associated risk factors and complications."
7249,799,"METHODS: Eighty-four patients with primary or secondary SS and chest imaging, chest radiograph, or CT scan were retrospectively evaluated for CLD."
7250,799,Thirteen patients with cysts were found.
7251,799,Baseline characteristics of all patients were collected.
7252,799,A multivariate logistic regression model was used to look for predictors of CLD in patients with CT scan.
7253,799,"Additional imaging, SSactivity, and complications from CLD and SS were collected for the patients with cysts."
7254,799,RESULTS: CLD had a frequency of 15.4%for all patients with chest imaging.
7255,799,"Not all cysts were evident on radiography, and CLD frequency was 30.9%for the patients with chest CT scan."
7256,799,Six patients had cysts without other radiographic findings.
7257,799,"CLD was associated with older age (OR, 1.1; 95%CI, 1.0-1.16), a diagnosis of secondary SS (OR, 12.1; 95%CI, 1.12-130.4), and seropositivity for anti-SS-related antigen A/Ro autoantibodies (OR, 26.9; 95%CI, 1.44-93.61)."
7258,799,There was no radiologic progression of CLD for 12 patients after a 4-year median follow-up.
7259,799,Lung function did not exhibit temporal worsening.
7260,799,CLD did not correlate with a specific pattern in pulmonary function testing.
7261,799,Two patients had secondary infectious complications of the cysts.
7262,799,CONCLUSIONS: CLD is a relatively common condition in SS that does not progress on serial radiologic and lung function follow-up.
7263,799,"CLD, without other radiographic findings, may represent a direct manifestation of SS."
7264,800,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic inflammatory systemic autoimmune disease affecting the exocrine, salivary and lacrimal glands."
7265,800,The condition occurs more often in adults and is rare in childhood.
7266,800,SS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent parotitis and keratoconjunctivitis sicca.
7267,800,Oral manifestations include early tooth decay and xerostomia.
7268,800,Treatment consists of operative dentistry and saliva management.
7269,800,"This paper reports a case of a 10-year-old Brazilian boy with SS, stressing the oral manifestations, treatment conduct, clinical importance and need for an early diagnosis in order to improve the patient's quality of life."
7270,801,"Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease is a relatively recently proposed clinical-pathologic entity that is characterized by fibro-inflammatory lesions rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells and, often but not always, elevated serum IgG4 concentrations."
7271,801,"IgG4-related disease was recognized as a systemic disease in 2003, when extrapancreatic manifestations were identified in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis."
7272,801,"Since then, the disease has been reported as affecting virtually every organ system and has been identified in the biliary tree, salivary and lacrimal glands, periorbital tissues, lungs, lymph nodes, thyroid gland, kidneys, prostate gland, testicles, breasts, and pituitary gland."
7273,801,"Its pathogenesis is poorly understood, but findings are consistent with both an autoimmune and an allergic disorder."
7274,801,"Although definitive diagnosis requires histopathologic analysis, imaging plays an important role in demonstrating infiltration and enlargement of involved organs."
7275,801,"Because of the systemic nature of the disease, imaging workup of IgG4-related disease should always include whole-body examinations to detect multiorgan involvement."
7276,801,"Patients often present with subacute development of a mass in or diffuse enlargement of the affected organ, sometimes mimicking a neoplastic process."
7277,801,"In every anatomic location, several inflammatory and neoplastic entities must be considered in the differential diagnosis."
7278,801,"Because IgG4-related disease usually shows a marked response to corticosteroid therapy, radiologists should be familiar with its clinical and imaging manifestations to avoid a delay in diagnosis and unnecessary surgical interventions."
7279,802,BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The present controlled sialographical study was conducted to learn more from the horizontal and vertical symmetry of the ductal lesions of the major salivary glands in primary (pSS) and secondary (sSS) forms of the disease.
7280,802,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 98 patients (38 pSS patients, 38 sSS patients, 22 control subjects) were included in the study."
7281,802,Contrast radiography of both parotid and submandibular glands was performed within the same session.
7282,802,A 6-point scoring system allowed summary indexes for each of the glands to be calculated.
7283,802,RESULTS: Pansialography was accomplished within 30 min each.
7284,802,The sparsity of the branching pattern of the ducts was the most frequent pathological finding.
7285,802,"In pSS, horizontal symmetry was more pronounced in the parotid glands, whereas in sSS it was more pronounced in the submandibular glands."
7286,802,The most discriminating features were the width of the peripheral ducts in the parotid and the number of acinar dilatations in the submandibular glands.
7287,802,The most advanced lesions were found in the left parotid gland.
7288,802,CONCLUSION: The peripheral ducts are more affected by SS than the main excretory duct.
7289,802,There is a tendency for asymmetric involvement of the parotid glands in pSS and of the submandibular glands in sSS.
7290,802,Parotid glands are globally more involved than submandibular glands.
7291,802,Differential diagnosis between pSS and sSS cannot be accomplished by means of pansialography alone.
7292,802,Left parotid sialography is recommended for routine use.
7293,803,OBJECTIVE: To reach a European consensus on the definition and characterization of the main organ-specific extraglandular manifestations in primary SS.
7294,803,"METHODS: The EULAR-SS Task Force Group steering committee agreed to approach SS-related systemic involvement according to the EULAR SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) classification and proposed the preparation of four separate manuscripts: articular, cutaneous, pulmonary and renal ESSDAI involvement; muscular, peripheral nervous system, CNS and haematological ESSDAI involvement; organs not included in the ESSDAI classification; and lymphoproliferative disease."
7295,803,Currently available evidence was obtained by a systematic literature review focused on SS-related systemic features.
7296,803,"RESULTS: The following information was summarized for articular, cutaneous, pulmonary and renal involvement: a clear, consensual definition of the clinical feature, a brief epidemiological description including an estimate of the prevalence reported in the main clinical series and a brief list of the key clinical and diagnostic features that could help physicians clearly identify these features."
7297,803,"Unfortunately we found that the body of evidence relied predominantly on information retrieved from individual cases, and the scientific information provided was heterogeneous."
7298,803,"The analysis of types of involvement was biased due to the unbalanced reporting of severe cases over non-severe cases, although the main sources of bias were the heterogeneous definitions of organ involvement (or even the lack of definition in some studies) and the heterogeneous diagnostic approach used in studies to investigate involvment of each organ."
7299,803,CONCLUSION: The proposals included in this article are a first step to developing an optimal diagnostic approach to systemic involvement in primary SS and may pave the way for further development of evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines.
7300,804,To identify risk and predictors of lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome.
7301,804,"Articles were identified through a comprehensive search strategy in Medline, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL."
7302,804,"Studies had to investigate primary Sjgren syndrome patients, 18 years of age or older, with the goal of examining potential clinical, immunological and hematological risk factors for lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease."
7303,804,The quality of the studies was graded using the Oxford Levels of Evidence Scale.
7304,804,"Whenever possible, the authors created evidence tables and performed meta-analysis."
7305,804,"Of 900 studies identified, 18 were selected for inclusion."
7306,804,"These studies provided data from over 15,000 patients (90 % female) for analysis."
7307,804,"Lymphadenopathy, parotid enlargement, palpable purpura, low C4 serum levels and cryoglobulins were the most consistent non-Hodgkins lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease predictors."
7308,804,"Additionally, some of the studies identified splenomegaly, low C3 serum levels, lymphopenia and neutropenia as significant prognostic factors."
7309,804,The detection of germinal center-like lesions in primary Sjgren Syndrome diagnostic salivary biopsies was also proposed as highly predictive of non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
7310,804,"In contrast, anemia, anti-Ro, anti-La, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, male gender and hypergammaglobulinemia were not associated with lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease."
7311,804,Patients with primary Sjgren syndrome have an increased risk of lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease compared to the general population.
7312,804,Ascertaining relevant and reliable predictors in this patient population would greatly facilitate the identification of patients at elevated risk for closer monitoring in the context of limited resources.
7313,805,Neurological manifestations of primary Sjgren's syndrome are multiple and appear frequently.
7314,805,"Depending on data analysis, patient recruitment, and diagnosis criteria used to defined primary Sjgren's syndrome or neurological manifestations, the estimated prevalence is between 0 and 70%."
7315,805,"Peripheral neurological complications seem the most common, particularly sensory-motors axonal neuropathies."
7316,805,Neuronopathy seems to be the most specific neurological complication of primary Sjgren's syndrome.
7317,805,"Central manifestations of primary Sjgren's syndrome are not uncommon, but the neurological complication's spectrum is not well defined."
7318,805,Neuromyelitis optica is regularly found among central complications.
7319,805,"To conclude, although central and peripheral complications of primary Sjgren's syndrome are difficult to assess, partly because of the wide spectrum of possible manifestations, it is around 20%."
7320,805,Neuronopathy is still the most specific complication.
7321,806,A woman with Sjgren syndrome manifesting as aphasia with a left deep cerebral white matter lesion tested positive for anti-aquaporin 4 (AQP4) antibody.
7322,806,"Open biopsy of the lesion revealed active demyelination with edematous changes and the preservation of most axons, indicating a non-necrotic demyelinating lesion."
7323,806,"Immunostaining for AQP4 was diffusely lost, whereas the loss of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining was limited but with highly degenerated astrocytic foot processes in perivascular areas."
7324,806,These results suggested neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) pathology rather than Sjgren-related vasculitis.
7325,806,Only cerebral cortical symptoms with a cerebral white matter lesion could be observed in NMOSDs.
7326,807,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of clinical pulmonary manifestations in primary SS (pSS), and based on registry data, to assess quality of life (QoL) and mortality in these patients."
7327,807,METHODS: Patients with pSS consecutively included in the Norwegian systemic CTD and vasculitis registry (NOSVAR) were investigated for pulmonary manifestations when presenting with clinical pulmonary symptoms.
7328,807,Pulmonary involvement was defined as typical abnormalities identified with high-resolution CT (HRCT) and/or pulmonary function tests (PFTs).
7329,807,"RESULTS: Among patients referred from our primary area, Oslo (n = 117), lung involvement was found in 26 patients (22%)."
7330,807,"In our total cohort (n = 216), 59 patients (27%) were affected."
7331,807,A higher rate of pulmonary complications and trends towards longer disease duration and higher age indicated a selection of more complicated cases referred from outside our primary area.
7332,807,Abnormal HRCTs were found in 50 patients (23%) and PFTs in 34 patients (16%).
7333,807,"The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey Physical Functioning subscore, was significantly reduced in patients with lung involvement (P = 0.03)."
7334,807,"Furthermore, a 4-fold increased risk of dying after 10 years of disease among patients with lung involvement (n = 10, 17%) compared with those without lung involvement (n = 7, 4.5%) (P = 0.002) was found."
7335,807,CONCLUSION: We found a high population-based prevalence of clinical pulmonary involvement (22%) among patients with pSS.
7336,807,"Moreover, patients with lung involvement had reduced QoL represented by the subscale Physical Functioning, and mortality was increased."
7337,808,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors linking innate and adaptive immune responses, which resulted overexpressed in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
7338,808,Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which was recently demonstrated to be involved in pSS pathogenesis.
7339,808,The study was undertaken to clarify whether TLR2 is involved in the production of IL-15 in human salivary gland epithelial cells (SGEC) from pSS patients.
7340,808,SGEC primary cell cultures were established from pSS minor salivary gland tissues explanted from patients with a sure diagnosis of SS.
7341,808,"After neutralization of TLR2 with a blocking monoclonal antibody, IL-15 production was assayed by immunoblotting and flow cytometry, IL-15 in the culture supernatants was measured by ELISA, and mRNA levels were assessed by RT-PCR and real-time PCR."
7342,808,The production of IL-15 by pSS SGEC decreased in culture supernatants and in protein lysates (p<0.01) when TLR2 signaling was inhibited in pSS SGEC.
7343,808,"In addition, a control at the transcriptional level was also detected; in fact, inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)-B through the transfection of pSS SGEC with the dominant-negative inhibitory B proteins (IB) vector (IBDN) abrogated the stimulatory effect of TLR2 on IL-15 production."
7344,808,These data suggest that TLR2 activation is involved in the induction of IL-15 production by pSS SGEC and promotes inflammation through NF-B activation.
7345,808,"Therefore, therapeutic strategies that target TLR2/IL-15 pathway might be strong candidates for preventing or treating pSS."
7346,809,The tear matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) immunoassay (Inflammadry) exhibits variable results in dry eye (DE) patients.
7347,809,We investigated if the tear volume in DE patients affects the results of MMP-9 immunoassay in clinical and in vitro settings.
7348,809,This cross-sectional study enrolled 188 eyes of 188 DE patients.
7349,809,"The clinical symptoms and signs of DE were assessed using the Ocular Surface Disease Index and visual analog scale, strip meniscometry, tear break-up time, and tear meniscus height (TMH), area (TMA), and depth (TMD) using swept-source optical coherence tomography and corneal and conjunctival staining scores."
7350,809,"For quantitative evaluation, the bands produced by the InflammaDry test were analyzed with ImageJ."
7351,809,DE subjects were grouped according to MMP-9 positivity and TMH.
7352,809,"The InflammaDry-positive group showed greater TMH, TMA, and TMD than the MMP-9-negative group (p < 0.05)."
7353,809,InflammaDry test band density in the high TMH group was significantly greater than that in the low and normal TMH groups (p < 0.05).
7354,809,"InflammaDry test band density correlated positively with TMH, TMA, and TMD (all p < 0.05)."
7355,809,InflammaDry test results were influenced by tear volume.
7356,809,"Low tear volume in aqueous tear-deficient DE may induce false-negative results, and reflex tearing during the test may induce false-positive results."
7357,810,"PURPOSE: To evaluate tear film stability in patients with tear dysfunction and an asymptomatic control group by using the novel, noninvasive Tear Stability Analysis System (TSAS)."
7358,810,"METHODS: In this prospective case-control study, 45 patients with dysfunctional tear syndrome (DTS) were stratified into three groups (1, 2, and 3/4) based on clinical severity, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms; 25 asymptomatic control subjects were evaluated."
7359,810,"TSAS measurements were performed with the RT-7000 Auto Refractor-Keratometer (Tomey Corporation, Nagoya, Japan)."
7360,810,Images of ring mires projected onto the cornea every second for 6 seconds were captured and analyzed.
7361,810,"Focal changes in brightness were calculated as numerical ring breakup (RBU) values, and the elapsed time when the cumulative values (RBU sum) exceeded a threshold was defined as the ring breakup time (RBUT)."
7362,810,"RESULTS: RBUTs in the DTS groups were all significantly lower than those in the control subjects, with the lowest values found in DTS 3/4."
7363,810,RBUT was significantly shorter in DTS 3/4 than in DTS 1 (P<0.001).
7364,810,"The change in RBU sum over a 6-second period in the DTS groups combined or between the individual groups was statistically significant (P<0.001), as was the difference between the 1- and 6-second values."
7365,810,"For distinguishing between asymptomatic controls and DTS, the sensitivity and specificity of a 5.0-second RBUT cutoff were 82.0% and 60.0%, respectively."
7366,810,"CONCLUSIONS: The TSAS may be a useful, noninvasive instrument for evaluating tear stability and for classifying DTS severity."
7367,811,"Our aim was to validate eight scintigraphic salivary gland (SG) parameters, as diagnostic parameters in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
7368,811,We used the standardized stimulated dynamic salivary gland scintigraphy (DSGS) protocol and correlated this with the unstimulated whole sialometry (UWS) functions.
7369,811,The DSGS and UWS tests meeting the European and the USA diagnostic classification criteria for SS were applied in twenty patients and in ten normal controls.
7370,811,The DSGS tests were performed 60min after the intravenous (i.v.)
7371,811,injection of 370MBq of technetium-99m-pertechnetate ((99m)TcO(-)4) and after per os stimulation with a 0.5g tablet of ascorbic acid administered 40min after the injection.
7372,811,"Using time-activity curves, eight different parameters were calculated for each parotid gland (PG) and each submandibular salivary gland (SMG): a) time at maximum counts (Tmax), b) time at minimum counts (Tmin), c) maximum accumulation (MA), d) accumulation velocity (AV), e) maximum secretion (MS), f) maximum stimulated secretion (MSS), g) stimulated secretion velocity (SSV), and h) uptake ratio (UR)."
7373,811,"Values of UWS below 2.5mL/15min, were considered abnormal."
7374,811,"All these parameters, as for the PG, showed significant abnormality in SS patients (P<0.001), especially of the secretion function."
7375,811,"All SMG parameters also showed a significant abnormality (P<0.001), but especially of the accumulation function."
7376,811,There was a greater impairment of the above parameters in SMG than in PG in the SS patients.
7377,811,"Sensitivity of the standardized DSGS was 100%, specificity 80%, negative prognostic value 100%, and positive prognostic value 91%."
7378,811,Sensitivity of UWS was 75%.
7379,811,"In conclusion, this paper suggested that the best diagnostic parameters for the SS patients were those of: a) the maximum secretion, b) the maximum stimulated secretion for both the parotid and the submandibular glands, c) maximum accumulation and d) accumulation velocity of submandibular glands."
7380,811,The times at maximum and at minimum counts were non diagnostic.
7381,812,"According to the classification criteria of the American-European Consensus Group (AECG), the prevalence of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) of about 0.2% in the adult population and a yearly incidence of 4/100.000 in the general population are far lower than previously assumed."
7382,812,"Moreover, the repeatedly reported male/female ratio of 1:9 seems to lie more in the range of 1:20."
7383,812,"Male pSS patients show fewer immunological, histopathological or sialographic findings and organ involvement."
7384,812,Information on age at disease onset has also changed over the last decade.
7385,812,Recent studies indicate an onset age of approximately 45 years as compared to 56 in earlier studies of the last decade.
7386,812,Patients with an early disease onset are more frequently positive for rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-Ro/SS-A.
7387,812,These patients also seem to have a higher risk of developing hypocomplementemia or lymphadenopathy.
7388,812,"As compared to earlier cohorts, the introduction of the rather specific AECG criteria will probably result in the participation of fewer men, younger patients in general and of more seriously ill patients in future cohorts."
7389,812,The change in the spectrum of pSS patients obviously reflects the altered classification criteria since the AECG criteria require anti-Ro/La positivity and therefore exclude a high number of patients with other immunological markers who also show severe sicca symptoms and organ involvements.
7390,812,"About 5%-10% of pSS patients in rheumatological care suffer from severe extraglandular manifestations, which generally occur soon after disease onset."
7391,812,"In particular, palpable purpura, hypocomplementemia, cryoglobulinemia and lymphoma are associated with increased mortality."
7392,812,"In Germany, approximately one tenth of Sjgren syndrome patients receive specialized rheumatological care."
7393,812,There is still insufficient knowledge about the vast majority of pSS patients who are not treated by rheumatologists.
7394,812,"These patients, as well as all those who, according to the AECG criteria, are not classified as having pSS either due to anti-Ro/La negativity or having secondary Sjgren's syndrome, probably add up to at least 0.4% of the adult population which, at present, suffers from considerable immunopathologic sicca symptoms."
7395,813,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence, clinical presentation, serological and morphological features of, and therapeutic options for Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) in primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS)."
7396,813,METHODS: Pubmed was searched between February 1996 and December 2018 using a combination of MESH terms related to pSS and ILD.
7397,813,Selected works were subjected to blind evaluation by two authors and a senior author in case of disagreement.
7398,813,The work followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018118669).
7399,813,"RESULTS: About 20% of pSS patients have ILD, with a 5-y survival of 84% and a need for supplemental oxygen in the 11-33% range."
7400,813,A significant proportion of ILD patients are seronegative without sicca syndrome.
7401,813,ILD seems to be associated with higher levels of Lactic Dehydrogenases and positivity for Anti-Ro52k.
7402,813,"The prevalent pattern in High Resolution Computed Tomography is Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP), but all other patterns can be present."
7403,813,No difference in mortality was found between patients with NSIP and Usual Interstitial Pneumonia patterns.
7404,813,Amyloidosis and primary lung lymphoma can be observed in about 10% of pSS patients.
7405,813,CONCLUSION: The recognition of pSS underlying an ILD can be challenging in seronegative patients with no or mild sicca symptoms.
7406,813,"A complete diagnostic assessment, including minor salivary glands and, in some cases, lung biopsy, should be performed on all patients at risk."
7407,813,A better recognition of the clinical or serological markers of ILD progression in these patients is warranted to drive the physicians to an early diagnosis and an effective treatment.
7408,814,Diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in Sjgren's syndrome (SS) might greatly benefit of the present multidisciplinary approach to studying the molecular pathogenesis of the disease.
7409,814,A deregulated inflammatory response has been described in the SS.
7410,814,The research in the last years sheds light on the importance of the NF-B pathway regulating the pro-inflammatory cytokine production and leukocyte recruitment.
7411,814,These are important contributors to the inflammatory response during the development of SS.
7412,814,"In this study we examine the expression of the NF-B inhibitory protein termed IB in salivary glands epithelial cells (SGEC) comparing it with SGEC from healthy controls, to test the hypothesis that an altered expression of IB occurs in SGEC from SS biopsies."
7413,814,"Real-Time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the expression level of IB was significantly lower in SS with respect to healthy controls leading to an increased NF-B activity."
7414,814,Our results suggest that the analysis of IB expression at salivary gland epithelial cell level could be a potential new hallmark of SS progression and sustain a rationale to more deeply investigate the therapeutic potential of specific NF-B inhibitors in SS.
7415,815,We report a rare case of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) with multiple microliths in the bilateral parotid glands.
7416,815,A 41-year-old man presented to our department with mild pain in the region of the right parotid gland.
7417,815,The dental examination was negative except for the parotid regions.
7418,815,The right region was moderately swollen and the left mildly swollen.
7419,815,Plain radiography revealed multiple calculi in the bilateral parotid glands.
7420,815,"Ultrasonography showed heterogenic parenchyma, with microliths and cystic lesions in the parotid glands and heterogenic echotexture in the submandibular glands."
7421,815,Immunologic tests and the Schirmer test confirmed the diagnosis of SS.
7422,815,"As the patient had no classic symptoms of SS, the bilateral multiple microliths were the first sign, facilitating the final diagnosis."
7423,815,Early diagnosis of SS is highly relevant because the proper therapy can be initiated.
7424,815,"Adequate follow-up and, especially, control of the disease activity by identifying the predictive factors, are the primary objectives of SS management, enabling personalized treatment of this malignant disease."
7425,815,This case is a good example of how detection of calcifications in the bilateral parotid glands by plain radiography can help diagnose SS at an early stage.
7426,816,OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in salivary epidermal growth factor (EGF) levels and the correlation between these levels and the severity of intraoral manifestations in Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
7427,816,METHODS: Forty SS patients and 23 controls were enrolled.
7428,816,"Salivary EGF concentration was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and intraoral manifestations were evaluated using a short version of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14)."
7429,816,"The associations among salivary flow rate, EGF levels and the severity of intraoral manifestations were analyzed."
7430,816,"RESULTS: The total salivary EGF output was significantly decreased in the SS patients compared with the controls (9237.6  8447.0 vs. 13296.9  7907.1 pg/10 min, respectively, p = 0.033)."
7431,816,"In the SS patients, total EGF output and salivary flow rate showed a strong positive correlation (rs = 0.824, p = 0.0005), while total EGF output and disease duration showed a negative correlation (rs = -0.484, p = 0.008)."
7432,816,"Further, total EGF output was significantly correlated with the OHIP-14 score (rs = -0.721, p = 0.012)."
7433,816,"CONCLUSIONS: The salivary flow rate and EGF levels are decreased in SS, and this deterioration in saliva quality causes refractory intraoral manifestations."
7434,816,Our findings have provided new therapeutic targets for SS.
7435,817,OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and the outcome of primary Sjgren Syndrome (pSS) associated arthritis and to compare the efficacy of different therapeutic regimen.
7436,817,METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using Club Rhumatisme and Inflammation (CRI) and French Internal Medicine Society (SNFMI) networks.
7437,817,All patients with a diagnosis of pSS and at least one episode of clinical and/or echographic synovitis were included.
7438,817,Patients with synovitis (cases) were compared to pSS patients without synovitis (controls).
7439,817,RESULTS: 57 patients (93% women) were included with a median age of 54years [45-63].
7440,817,"Patients with synovitis had more frequently lymph node enlargement (12.3% vs. 1.8%, p=.007) and a higher ESSDAI score (8 [6-12] vs. 2 [1-4], p<.0001)."
7441,817,"There was no difference concerning CRP levels, rheumatoid factor and cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP)-antibodies positivity."
7442,817,"Among 57 patients with synovitis, 101 various treatment courses have been used during the follow-up of 40 [22.5-77] months."
7443,817,"First treatment course consisted in steroids alone (3.5%), steroids in association (79%) with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (49%), methotrexate (MTX) (35%), rituximab (RTX) (5.3%) or other immunosuppressive drugs (7%)."
7444,817,"HCQ, MTX, and RTX were associated with a significant reduction of tender and swollen joint count, and a significant steroids-sparing effect."
7445,817,No difference could be shown for the joint response between these treatment regimens.
7446,817,CONCLUSION: pSS articular manifestations may include synovitis which could mimic rheumatoid arthritis but differ by the absence of structural damage.
7447,817,"Even if the use of HCQ, MTX, and RTX seem to be effective for joint involvement, the best regimen remains to be determined."
7448,818,"OBJECTIVES: Onset of primary SS is usually between 40 and 60 years of age, with severe systemic complications in 15% of cases."
7449,818,We sought to determine whether early-onset disease is related to a specific phenotype and if it is predictive of a poor outcome.
7450,818,"METHODS: Biological and clinical data from 393 patients recruited in the ASSESS cohort, a French multicentre prospective cohort, were compared according to age at diagnosis."
7451,818,"RESULTS: Fifty-five patients had early-onset disease, defined as age 35 years at diagnosis, and presented a significantly higher frequency of salivary gland enlargement (47.2% vs 33.3%, P = 0.045), adenopathy (25.5% vs 11.8%, P = 0.006), purpura (23.6% vs 9.2%, P = 0.002) and renal involvement (16.4% vs 4.4%, P = 0.003)."
7452,818,"They had a higher frequency of hypergammaglobulinaemia (60.8% vs 26.6%, P < 0.001), RF positivity (41.5% vs 20.2%, P < 0.001), low C3 level (18.9% vs 9.1%, P = 0.032), low C4 level (54.7% vs 40.2%, P = 0.048) and autoantibodies [84.6% with anti-SSA vs 54.4% (P < 0.001) and 57.7% with anti-SSB vs 29.7% (P < 0.001)]."
7453,818,"The change in ESSDAI scores between baseline and the 5-year follow-up was significantly different (P = 0.005) with a trend for worsening in the early-onset group (0.72, P = 0.27) and a significant improvement in the later onset group (-1.27, P < 0.0001)."
7454,818,CONCLUSION: Early-onset primary SS is associated with a specific phenotype defined by clinical and biological features known to be predictive factors of severe systemic disease.
7455,818,"Interestingly, we showed a different evolution of the ESSDAI score depending on the age at disease onset, patients with early-onset disease tending to worsen over time."
7456,819,"Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Sjgren syndrome (SS) ameliorate during pregnancy, through dampening (immunotolerance) of the maternal immune system which protects the fetus from rejection."
7457,819,A large number of studies have shown that human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) contributes to this tolerance.
7458,819,Studies on animal models have reaffirmed that hCG treatment mimics the benefits of pregnancy.
7459,819,"Based on the scientific evidence, randomized clinical trials comparing hCG with current therapies and/or placebo are recommended for RA, SS, and for other autoimmune diseases such as, type 1 diabetes and ankylosing spondylitis, which also get better during pregnancy and hCG treatment seems to help."
7460,820,"Castleman disease is a rare cause of lymphoid hyperplasia and may result in localized symptoms or an aggressive, multisystem disorder."
7461,820,It can mimic other diseases like lymphoma or tuberculosis.
7462,820,"It classically presents as a mediastinal mass that involves the lymphatic tissue primarily but can also affect extra lymphatic sites including the lungs, larynx, parotid glands, pancreas, meninges, and muscles."
7463,820,"In HIV and HHV8-negative patients with idiopathic multi-centric Castleman disease, pathogenesis may involve autoimmune mechanisms."
7464,820,We highlight and report a case of a 34-year-old Ghanaian female who was successfully diagnosed and managed for Sjgren's as well as plasma cell variant Castleman disease with combination chemotherapy and rituximab followed by eighteen months maintenance therapy with pulse chlorambucil and prednisolone and three monthly rituximab.
7465,821,OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the molecular details regarding the contribution of different cell types of the salivary gland to the altered gene expression profile seen in Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
7466,821,"METHODS: Using laser microdissection, tissue samples enriched in acini, ducts and inflammatory foci in subjects with and without SS were isolated for RNA-seq analysis."
7467,821,Gene expression profiles were analysed and selected enriched genes were further examined using real time PCR and by immunofluorescence.
7468,821,RESULTS: RNA-seq analysis of salivary biopsies from subjects with and without SS revealed marked differences in gene expression occurring in the ductal and infiltrating cells compared to acinar cells.
7469,821,Up-regulated genes in the SS ductal cells included C4A complement and the SLC26A9 ion channel.
7470,821,"The inflammatory infiltrate showed the most dramatic differences in gene expression and contained up-regulated genes associated with T-cells, natural killer, dendritic and basophils/mast cells."
7471,821,"qPCR with total salivary gland mRNA confirmed the differential mRNA expression of several genes (MMP9, FOL1HB, CCL21, CCR7), thereby validating the approach."
7472,821,Additional immunofluorescence studies demonstrated high expression and co-localisation of CCL21 chemokine and CCR7 chemokine receptor within the SS infiltrates.
7473,821,CONCLUSIONS: Major gene expression changes in the salivary gland of SS were detected in the ductal and inflammatory cells and not in the acinar cells.
7474,821,"Two chemokines involved in immune cell trafficking to secondary lymphoid tissue, CCR7 and CCL21, showed markedly increased expression and may contribute to the recruitment of diverse immune cells to the salivary glands, causing inflammation and loss of secretory function."
7475,822,PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to compare the severity of ocular and systemic findings among patients with primary Sjgren syndrome.
7476,822,METHODS: The study followed a prospective controlled design and comprised two groups; the test group included 58 eyes of 58 patients newly diagnosed with primary Sjgren syndrome with poor dry eye test findings and the control group included 45 right eyes of 45 healthy age- and sex-matched individuals.
7477,822,"The ocular surface disease index score, tear osmolarity, Schirmer I test without anesthesia, fluorescein tear breakup time, and cornea-conjunctiva staining with lissamine green (van Bijsterveld scoring) were used to examine tear function in the patients via a complete ophthalmological examination."
7478,822,"The results were graded and classified on the basis of a Dry Eye WorkShop report and results of the corneal and conjunctival staining test, Schirmer's test, and fluorescein tear breakup time test."
7479,822,"Discomfort, severity and frequency of symptoms, visual symptoms, conjunctival injection, eyelid-meibomian gland findings, and corneal-tear signs were interpreted."
7480,822,"Disease activity was scored per the EULAR Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI) via systemic examination and laboratory evaluations, and the EULAR Sjgren's syndrome patient-reported index (ESSPRI) assessed via a survey of patient responses."
7481,822,RESULTS: Mean patient age was 48.15  16.34 years in the primary Sjgren syndrome group and 44.06  9.15 years in the control group.
7482,822,Mean fluorescein tear breakup time was 4.51  2.89s in the primary Sjgren syndrome group and 10.20  2.39 s in the control group.
7483,822,Mean Schirmer I test result was 3.51  3.18 mm/5 min in the primary Sjgren syndrome group and 9.772.30 mm/5 min in the control group.
7484,822,"Mean ocular surface disease index score was 18.56  16.09 in the primary Sjgren syndrome group, and 19.92  7.16 in the control group."
7485,822,"Mean osmolarity was 306.48  19.35 in the primary Sjgren syndrome group, and 292.54  10.67 in the control group."
7486,822,"Mean lissamine green staining score was 2.17  2.76 in the primary Sjgren syndrome group, and 0.00 in the control group."
7487,822,"Statistically significant differences were found berween the primary Sjgren syndrome group and control group in terms of fluorescein tear breakup time, Schirmer's test, lissamine green staining, and osmolarity tests (p=0.036, p=0.041, p=0.001, and p=0.001 respectively)."
7488,822,"The Dry Eye WorkShop score was 2.15  0.98, the EULAR Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index score was 11.18  4.05, and the EULAR Sjgren's syndrome patient-reported index score was 5.202.63."
7489,822,"When potential associations of the Dry Eye Workshop Study scores and osmolarity scores with the Eular Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index scores were evaluated, the results were found to be statistically significant (p=0.001, p=0.001 respectively)."
7490,822,CONCLUSION: The results showed an association between dry eye severity and systemic activity index in primary Sjgren syndrome patients.
7491,823,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined voice, speech, and laryngeal characteristics in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
7492,823,"METHODS: Eleven patients (10 female, 1 male; mean [SD] age = 57 [14] years) from The University of Utah Division of Rheumatology provided connected speech and sustained vowel samples."
7493,823,"Analyses included the Multi-Dimensional Voice Profile, the Analysis of Dysphonia in Speech and Voice, and dysphonia severity, speech clarity, and videolaryngostroboscopy ratings."
7494,823,"RESULTS: Shimmer, amplitude perturbation quotient, and average fundamental frequency differed significantly from normative values (P < .01)."
7495,823,Cepstral Spectral Index of Dysphonia values indicated mild-to-moderate dysphonia in connected speech (mean [SD] = 20.26 [8.36]) and sustained vowels (mean [SD] = 16.91 [11.08]).
7496,823,Ratings of dysphonia severity and speech clarity using 10-cm visual analog scales suggested mild-to-moderate dysphonia in connected speech (mean [SD] = 2.11 [1.72]) and sustained vowels (mean [SD] = 3.13 [2.20]) and mildly reduced speech clarity (mean [SD] = 1.46 [1.36]).
7497,823,Videolaryngostroboscopic ratings indicated mild-to-moderate dryness and mild reductions in overall laryngeal function.
7498,823,Voice Handicap Index scores indicated mild-to-moderate voice symptoms (mean [SD] = 43 [23]).
7499,823,"CONCLUSION: Individuals with pSS may experience dysphonia and articulatory imprecision, typically in the mild-to-moderate range."
7500,823,These findings have implications for diagnostic and referral practices in pSS.
7501,824,BACKGROUND: The association of primary Sjogrens Syndrome (SS) and amyloidosis has been recognized but scarcely assessed.
7502,824,OBJECTIVE: Herein we analyzed the literature regarding this association in order to describe a SS phenotype prone to both conditions.
7503,824,"METHODS: PubMed and CINAHL databases were searched from inception until April 2016 for the keywords: Amyloidosis, amyloid, Sjgren's syndrome and their combinations."
7504,824,"RESULTS: Most of the cases corresponded to localized amyloidosis mainly at skin and lung, whereas only three cases were systemic."
7505,824,"Other places of localized amyloidosis were the kidney, tracheobronchial, tongue, breast, salivary gland and vocal cord."
7506,824,"Most of the localized forms corresponded to AL type, whereas AA amyloidosis was uncommon."
7507,824,"The diagnosis of amyloidosis followed the SS onset (1-25 years) and in the majority of patients the presence of B cell hyperactivity traduced by hypergammaglobulinemia, positive rheumatoid factor and/or anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies were observed."
7508,824,"In seven patients, an associated lymphoma was also documented."
7509,824,CONCLUSION: The spectrum of lymphoid proliferation associated with SS extends beyond the classical B cell lymphoma.
7510,824,Localized or systemic amyloidosis might coexist with primary SS.
7511,824,Localized amyloidosis should be suspected in patients with consistently high serologic activity and suggestive lesions.
7512,825,PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sjgren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting lacrimal and salivary glands that often is accompanied by extraglandular disease manifestations.
7513,825,"Although common in adults, the prevalence and prognosis of childhood Sjgren syndrome are unknown, in part due to lack of child-specific diagnostic and classification criteria."
7514,825,This review discusses difficulties in diagnosing childhood Sjgren syndrome and highlights recent findings in Sjgren syndrome treatment and pathogenesis from studies in adults and animal models over the past 18 months.
7515,825,"RECENT FINDINGS: Studies of rituximab show some therapeutic potential in adult Sjgren syndrome, whereas newer modalities including gene therapy and mesenchymal stem cell transfer are promising."
7516,825,"The pathogenesis of Sjgren syndrome is emerging, including roles of T and B lymphocytes, autoantibodies, interferons, and glandular epithelial cells."
7517,825,"Specific recent notable findings in Sjgren syndrome pathogenesis include identification of a type II interferon signature in salivary glands of Sjgren syndrome patients, characterization of salivary gland-infiltrating T-cell subsets, and characterization of antimuscarinic acetylcholine receptor type 3 autoantibodies."
7518,825,SUMMARY: Childhood Sjgren syndrome is a poorly defined and underdiagnosed autoimmune disease that requires child-specific criteria in order to study disease burden and prognosis.
7519,825,"Studies in adults and animal models continue to elucidate new potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets, which may be relevant for childhood Sjgren syndrome."
7520,825,VIDEO ABSTRACT: http://links.lww.com/COR/A3.
7521,826,PURPOSE: To compare the stability of the tear film after instillation of eye drops containing hyaluronic acid (HA) or crosslinked hyaluronic acid (CLHA)-based in patients with Sjgren syndrome-related dry eye (SSDE).
7522,826,"METHODS: Forty subjects were included in this study and were divided into 2 groups: the first group (control group) consisted of 20 healthy volunteers; the second group (study group) constituted of 20 suffering from SSDE; before and 5, 30, and 60min after instillation of eye drops the surface regularity index (SRI) and surface asymmetry index (SAI) were registered."
7523,826,"RESULTS: Comparing HA and CLHA, in the control group, SAI show statistically significant difference in the time 0 and in time 5, whereas there is no a statistically significant difference after 30 and 60min from instillation."
7524,826,For SRI there is no statistically significant difference at any time.
7525,826,"In SSDE group there is no statistically significant difference in the time 0 and 5, whereas there is a statistically significant difference after 60min for SAI, and after 30 and 60min for SRI from instillation."
7526,826,Both SRI and SAI in dry eyes were significantly greater than in control eyes (P<0.05).
7527,826,CONCLUSION: Our study showed a better efficacy of CLHA compared with HA in maintaining the stability of the tear film in a patient suffering from SSDE.
7528,827,IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune epithelitis.
7529,827,"This exocrinopathy is frequently associated with extraglandular complications, and the patients are at risk of developing B cell lymphoma."
7530,827,"Given the lack of disease-modifying drugs, and the fact that SS is a quintessential B-cell mediated disease, attention has recently been focused on biotherapies."
7531,827,"AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Despite negative grounds, TNF-alpha antagonists have been tested in the disease, and proven not be efficient."
7532,827,"However, B-cell depleting therapy using anti-CD20 antibodies such as rituximab, which is a chimeric mAb, has shown promise in the field, while anti-CD22 mAb seems to be less active."
7533,827,"WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: New treatments against the B-cell activating factor of the TNF family are about to be tested, or replaced by receptor immunoglobulin decay protein."
7534,827,"TAKE HOME MESSAGE: B-cell depleting therapies seem promising in SS, but no data are, thus far, available on treatments targeting B-cell activating factor of the TNF family."
7535,828,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate renal expression of C4d, a complement component in the classical/mannose binding lectin (MBL) pathway, in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)-associated renal impairments."
7536,828,METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and pathological data from 39 patients with pSS presenting with renal impairments.
7537,828,C4d was examined in paraffin-embedded biopsy tissues using immunohistochemistry.
7538,828,Glomerular C4d positive was defined when >75% glomeruli were globally stained.
7539,828,"Tubulointerstitial C4d (TI-C4d) were scored semi-quantitatively as 0 (absent), 1 (spotty or weak), 2 (patchy) and 3 (diffuse)."
7540,828,A TI-C4d score2 was considered TI-C4d positive and included in the TI-C4d(+) group and vice versa.
7541,828,"Peritubular capillary (PTC) C4d was scored as 0 (absent), 1 (0~10%, minimal), 2 (10%~50%, focal), and 3 (>50%, diffuse)."
7542,828,RESULTS: Glomerular C4d deposition was observed in all 8 patients with pSS-related membranous nephropathy (MN) without obvious C1q deposition.
7543,828,Two of 5 patients with mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis and 1 of 2 patients with IgA nephropathy had mild mesangial C4d deposition.
7544,828,Sixteen patients (6 glomerular dominant and 10 tubulointerstitial dominant) presented TI-C4d score2.
7545,828,"Patients in the TI-C4d(+) group exhibited a higher serum creatinine level at the time of renal biopsy (TI-C4d(+) 132.5 [89.7, 165.5] vs. TI-C4d(-) 83.0 [70.7, 102.0] mol/L, P=0.008)."
7546,828,"PTC C4d was observed in 12 patients, with each of minimal, focal and diffuse staining being noted in 4 patients."
7547,828,CONCLUSIONS: The MBL pathway of complement activation was potentially involved in pSS-related MN.
7548,828,Tubulointerstitial C4d might be a pathological marker of severe renal injury in patients with pSS-related renal impairments.
7549,829,"Fc receptor-like protein 4 (FcRL4) is normally expressed on a small subset of mucosa-associated B-cells, as well as on mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma B-cells."
7550,829,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients have an increased risk of developing MALT lymphomas, preferentially in the parotid glands."
7551,829,For this reason we studied here by immunohistochemistry and mRNA analysis whether FcRL4 expressing B-cells are present in salivary gland tissue (labial and parotid) of pSS patients (n=54) and non-pSS sicca patients (n=16) and whether parotid gland MALT lymphomas in pSS patients (n=49) also express this receptor.
7552,829,"We also studied the effect of treatment (rituximab and abatacept) on the presence of FcRL4(+) B-cells, and whether numbers in labial gland biopsies at time of diagnosis of pSS can predict whether patients are at risk for MALT lymphoma development."
7553,829,We demonstrate that FcRL4(+) cells are present in salivary gland tissue of pSS patients where they are closely associated with ductal epithelial cells forming lymphoepithelial lesions.
7554,829,"The glandular FcRL4(+) cells are highly proliferative, genuine PAX5(+) B-cells."
7555,829,These FcRL4(+) B-cells are far more frequent in parotid gland than in labial gland tissue (p=0.003).
7556,829,We further show that expression of FcRL4 is present in pSS-related parotid MALT lymphomas.
7557,829,The FcRL4 mRNA expression level in parotid MALT lymphoma is increased compared to parotid gland tissue of pSS patients without lymphoma (p=0.017).
7558,829,"However, numbers of FcRL4(+) B-cells in labial gland biopsies taken at the time of pSS diagnosis, are not predictive for later development of MALT lymphoma."
7559,829,"Reduction of parotid gland FcRL4(+) B-cells by rituximab, but not abatacept is accompanied by restoration of the glandular epithelium, illustrating the crosstalk between these B-cells with the ductal cells."
7560,829,"In conclusion, intraepithelial FcRL4(+) B-cells are present in the salivary glands of pSS patients."
7561,829,These cells are likely involved in the epithelial changes seen in pSS.
7562,829,Their enrichment in parotid glands may explain why MALT lymphomas in pSS patients preferentially develop at this specific location.
7563,830,OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the histopathological changes in parotid gland tissue of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients treated with abatacept.
7564,830,"METHODS: In all 15 pSS patients included in the open-label Active Sjgren Abatacept Pilot (ASAP, 8 abatacept infusions) study parotid gland biopsies were taken before treatment and at 24 weeks of follow up."
7565,830,Biopsies were analysed for pSS-related histopathological features and placed in context of clini- cal responsiveness as assessed with EULAR Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI).
7566,830,RESULTS: Abatacept treatment resulted in a decrease of germinal centres (GCs)/ mm2 (p=0.173).
7567,830,"Number of GCs/mm2 at baseline was associated with response in the glandular domain of ESSDAI (Spearman =0.644, p=0.009)."
7568,830,"Abatacept treatment did not reduce focus score, lymphoepithelial lesions, area of lymphocytic infiltrate, amount of CD21+ networks of follicular dendritic cells, and numbers of CD3+ T-cells or CD20+ B- cells."
7569,830,"Number of IgM plasma cells/mm2 increased (p=0.041), while numbers of IgA and IgG plasma cells/mm2 were unaffected during abatacept treatment."
7570,830,"CONCLUSIONS: Abatacept affects formation of GCs of pSS patients in parotid glands, which is dependent on co-stimulation of activated follicular-helper-T-cells."
7571,830,"Herewith, local formation of (autoreactive) memory B-cells is inhibited."
7572,830,Presence of GCs at baseline predicts responsiveness to abatacept in the ESSDAI glandular domain.
7573,831,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease leading to mucosal dryness.
7574,831,"It may also involve joints, nerves, kidneys and lungs."
7575,831,Patients with SS are also at increased risk for lymphoma.
7576,831,"Diagnosis of SS relies on clinical, biological, histological and radiological criteria, after exclusion of other causes."
7577,831,"Initial work-up may be performed in general practice, by serology (antinuclear and anti-SSA/SSB antibodies, rheumatoid factor) and by measuring lacrimal and salivary flow."
7578,831,Antibodies may be within normal range in up to one third of patients and when present are not specific for SS.
7579,831,Histological proof of lymphocytic sialadenitis is precious but invasive.
7580,831,Major salivary glands sonography may help select candidates for labial biopsy.
7581,831,"This article elaborates the steps to be taken in case of suspected SS, in order to facilitate early diagnosis."
7582,832,"Sjgren syndrome affecting the major cerebral arteries is rare, and an optimal therapeutic strategy to counteract such a lesion has not yet been established."
7583,832,"We herein report a case of a 39-year-old woman with a history of primary Sjgren syndrome, which had previously been treated with immunosuppressive therapy, manifesting with a crescendo transient ischemic attack because of left middle cerebral artery stenosis."
7584,832,"Despite the administration of high doses of prednisolone and azathioprine for active Sjgren syndrome, the frequency of crescendo transient ischemic attacks increased with the progression of stenosis and magnetic resonance imaging showed the development of subacute cerebral infarction."
7585,832,Single-photon emission computed tomography with N-isopropyl[(123)I]-p-iodoamphetamine revealed apparent hemodynamic compromise in the affected cerebral hemisphere.
7586,832,"In light of the increased risk of further progression of cerebral infarction, we decided to perform surgical revascularization in spite of her active inflammatory condition."
7587,832,The patient underwent extracranial-intracranial bypass without complications and was treated with intensive immunosuppressive therapy during the perioperative period.
7588,832,"Based on our findings, we recommend surgical revascularization for occlusive cerebrovascular disease with hemodynamic compromise in combination with intensive immunosuppressive therapy, even in the active inflammatory state of autoimmune diseases, if ischemic symptoms are medically uncontrollable."
7589,833,OBJECTIVE: To assess the inter- and intraobserver reliability of ultrasound of major salivary glands in patients clinically suspected of having primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) as well as to assess sources ofvariation in outcomes of ultrasonographic evaluation.
7590,833,METHODS: 80 consecutive outpatients with clinically suspected pSS underwent ultrasound evaluation.
7591,833,"The following ultrasound variables of the parotid and submandibular salivary glands were assessed: echogenicity, parenchymal homogeneity, presence of hypoechogenic areas, hyperechogenic reflections and clearness of posterior glandular border, according to the scoring system of Hocevar et al."
7592,833,(total score range: 0-48).
7593,833,Images were scored independently by three blinded observers in two sessions.
7594,833,"RESULTS: The intraobserver reliability of the total ultrasound score was excellent, with an intraclass correlation (ICC) ranging from 0.89 to 0.96."
7595,833,"The interobserver reliability was good to excellent, with ICCs of 0.84 and 0.76 for the total ultrasound score in the two sessions."
7596,833,The kappa value ranged from 0.60 to 0.83 depending on the applied cut-offs (cut-off score 15 and 17).
7597,833,Hypoechogenic areas and homogeneity of parotid glands showed the highest interobserver reliability.
7598,833,The median kappa for echogenicity was low.
7599,833,The total ultrasound scores varied more between observers in patients with higher ultrasonographic scores (approximately scores 20).
7600,833,CONCLUSION: Ultrasound of major salivary glands is a reliable imaging technique for patients with clinically suspected pSS.Discrepancies between observers in assessing the severity of ultrasound findings may interfere with detecting 'true' changes over time.
7601,833,"When monitoring the progression of pSS or treatment efficacy, it is advised that a particular patient be scored by the same ultrasonographer at every time point."
7602,834,BACKGROUND: Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been widely used in the treatment of Sjogren's syndrome.
7603,834,"However, there remains no systematic review to assess the effectiveness and safety of CHM."
7604,834,OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and safety of CHM in the treatment of Sjogren's syndrome.
7605,834,"SEARCH STRATEGY: Literature was searched from PubMed, the Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2010), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, the Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (SinoMed), Wanfang Data and the Traditional Chinese Medical Periodical Literature Database."
7606,834,"The time limitation ran from the commencement of each database to October 15, 2010."
7607,834,INCLUSION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing CHM alone or in combination with Western medicine (WM) against WM or placebo used alone were included.
7608,834,DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors collected data independently.
7609,834,The assessment of methodological quality was based on the Cochrane handbook and the data were analyzed by using RevMan 5.0.17 software.
7610,834,Heterogeneity of the included studies was tested and use of statistical model was based on the heterogeneity.
7611,834,The efficacy measure was relative risk (RR) or mean difference with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
7612,834,RESULTS: A total of 52 RCTs involving 3 886 patients were included.
7613,834,The included trials were all of low quality.
7614,834,"CHM was superior in improving clinical symptoms to WM, with statistical significance between the groups (RR:1.36; 95% CI: 1.24-1.49); CHM plus WM was better than WM used alone (RR: 1.38; 95% CI:1.30-1.46)."
7615,834,"CHM improved lacrimal gland function more effectively than WM, with statistical significance between the groups (RR:2.12; 95% CI:1.06-3.18); CHM plus WM was better than WM used alone (RR:1.90; 95% CI: 0.99-2.81)."
7616,834,"CHM was superior to WM in the improvement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (RR:-9.63; 95% CI:-15.73--3.52), and CHM plus WM was also more effective than WM used alone (RR:-8.42; 95% CI:-14.71--2.13)."
7617,834,"However, there was no statistical difference between groups in other immune index (C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, IgG, IgA and IgM)."
7618,834,"The reported adverse effects of CHM were mainly gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea."
7619,834,The incidence of adverse effects of WM was higher than that of CHM.
7620,834,CONCLUSION: CHM appears to improve the symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome.
7621,834,"However, due to the low quality of included studies, further well-designed multicenter and large-scale RCTs are still needed to evaluate the beneficial effects of CHM."
7622,835,"Salivary gland biopsy is a technique broadly applied for the diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome (SS), lymphoma in SS, and connective tissue disorders (sarcoidosis, amyloidosis)."
7623,835,"In SS characteristic histology findings are found, including lymphocytic infiltration surrounding the excretory ducts in combination with destruction of acinar tissue."
7624,835,"In this article the main techniques are described for taking labial and parotid salivary gland biopsies with respect to their advantages, postoperative complications, and usefulness for diagnostic procedures, monitoring disease progression, and evaluation of treatment."
7625,836,"OBJECTIVE: To determine serum levels of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) as compared to healthy volunteers and patients with sicca symptoms, and to determine whether serum HMGB1 levels are correlated with disease activity in pSS."
7626,836,"METHODS: Serum HMGB1 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 101 patients with pSS, 13 patients with sicca symptoms, and 40 healthy volunteers."
7627,836,Clinical and laboratory variables were also analysed and serum HMGB1 levels were correlated with the Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (SSDAI).
7628,836,"RESULTS: The serum levels of HMGB1 were significantly increased in pSS patients as compared to patients with sicca symptoms and healthy controls (p = 0.04 and p = 0.01, respectively)."
7629,836,"In the subgroups of patients with anti-SSA autoantibodies, the serum levels of HMGB1 were significantly higher than those in the subgroup of pSS patients who were anti-SSA negative and in healthy controls and patients with sicca symptoms (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.004, respectively)."
7630,836,"There was no significant correlation between serum HMGB1 levels (in pSS patients with anti-SSA autoantibodies) and SSDAI score (r = 0.03, p = 0.83)."
7631,836,"Patients with active disease had higher HMGB1 levels than patients with low disease activity (p = 0.04), but HMGB1 levels did not correlate with the SSDAI."
7632,836,CONCLUSION: Serum HMGB1 levels are increased in pSS patients and more specifically in patients with SSA autoantibodies.
7633,836,"There was, however, no correlation of HMGB1 with the SSDAI."
7634,837,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) or autoimmune epithelitis is a prototype autoimmune disorder with unique features: a broad clinical spectrum that extends from local exocrinopathy to systemic disease and lymphoma development, and an easy access to the inflamed tissues (minor salivary glands; MSG), which enables the investigators to study the autoimmune processes."
7635,837,The autoimmune lesion consists of lymphocytic infiltrates that develop around the ducts and vary in severity and composition.
7636,837,"T cells (mainly CD4(+)) are the dominant lymphocytes in mild MSG lesions, whereas B cells in severe ones."
7637,837,"Th1 cytokines predominate in SS infiltrates, albeit Th2 and Th17 responses have been also reported."
7638,837,"Notably, increased infiltration by IL-18(+) cells has been associated with parotid gland enlargement and C4-hypocomplementemia, which are adverse prognostic factors for lymphoma development."
7639,837,"Even though SS pathogenesis has not been fully revealed, several aspects have been delineated."
7640,837,"Among them, the key role of MSG epithelia in the initiation and perpetuation of local autoimmune responses is well-established and involves the capacity of epithelial cells to mediate the recruitment, homing, activation, proliferation and differentiation of immunocytes."
7641,837,"In addition, genetic features, including certain HLA phenotypes and polymorphisms in genes encoding cytokines or factors implicated in cytokine signaling, environmental (such as viruses) and hormonal factors are thought to participate in disease pathogenesis."
7642,837,"Herein, the known aspects of SS pathogenesis, as well as unmet issues are discussed."
7643,838,BACKGROUND: Saireito consists of components of shosaikoto and goreisan.
7644,838,"There are several reports of liver injury caused by shosaikoto and saireito, whereas cases caused by goreisan are rarely seen."
7645,838,PATIENT: A 70-year-old woman suffered from sicca of the eyes and oral cavity that arose in 2003.
7646,838,"In June 2004, we diagnosed her as having Sjgren syndrome on the basis of Schirmer's test, salivary scintigraphy, presence of anti-SS-A/Ro antibody, and subjective symptoms."
7647,838,"Although a muscarinic agonist was commenced, her sicca symptoms did not improve."
7648,838,"INTERVENTIONS: In February 2008, 7.5 g/day of shosaikoto extract granules (for ethical use, Tsumura & Co., Tokyo, Japan) was introduced."
7649,838,Her symptoms and laboratory data did not change.
7650,838,"The next month, the treatment was replaced by 9.0 g/day of saireito extract granules (for ethical use, Tsumura & Co., Tokyo, Japan)."
7651,838,"RESULTS: After 10 weeks, elevation of liver enzymes was observed."
7652,838,"On suspicion of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), saireito was withdrawn, and the patient's liver enzymes returned to normal the next month."
7653,838,"Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation tests (DLSTs) for saireito, shosaikoto, and goreisan were all positive."
7654,838,CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course suggested allergy to the goreisan component of saireito.
7655,838,"It is important to be aware of the limitation of DLST as a diagnostic tool for DILI, especially for herbal medicines."
7656,839,"Aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the Rose Bengal score test for Sjgren's syndrome (SS), and to explore differences between other tests and examinations."
7657,839,"All participants were examined, including (but not limited to) unstimulated (UWS) and stimulated (SWS) whole saliva, labial gland biopsy (LGB or focus score), ophthalmologic questionnaire (ocular surface disease index OSDI) and objective tests: Schirmer test 1 (Sch."
7658,839,"1), Schirmer test 2 (Sch.2), Tear Break-up Time (TBUT) test and Rose Bengal score (RBS)."
7659,839,"Data were analyzed using Mann Whitney U-test, Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis, with specificity and sensitivity calculations and Spearman's correlation test."
7660,839,ROC curves showed a poor diagnostic performance of TBUT and OSDI.
7661,839,Sch.
7662,839,"1, Sch.2 and LGB all exhibited a high diagnostic performance."
7663,839,"RBS exhibited the best performance (sensitivity 100,00; specificity 100,00; AUC 1,000)."
7664,839,"Study reveals the scarce reliability of TBUT, OSDI and Sch.1, and emphasizes RBS as the test of choice in the SS diagnosis."
7665,840,OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical efficacy of the treatment of Sjgren's syndrome dry eye using 0.03% tacrolimus eye drop.
7666,840,DESIGN: Prospective double-blind randomized study.
7667,840,SETTING: Institutional outpatient clinic.
7668,840,PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight eyes of twenty-four patients with dry eye related to Sjgren syndrome were enrolled in this study.
7669,840,The patients were randomized in 2 groups: tacrolimus (n=14) and vehicle (n=10) group.
7670,840,INTERVENTION: The tacrolimus group received a vial containing tacrolimus 0.03% (almond oil as vehicle) and the other group received the almond oil vehicle.
7671,840,All patients were instructed to use the eye drops every 12h in the lower conjunctival sac.
7672,840,"MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Schirmer I test, break-up-time (BUT), corneal fluorescein and Rose Bengal staining scores were evaluated in all patients one day before the treatment (baseline), 7, 14, 28 and 90 days after treatment with the eye drops."
7673,840,RESULTS: The average fluorescein and Rose Bengal scores improved statistically after 7 days of treatment and even more after 90 days.
7674,840,"The average Schirmer I and BUT values were unchanged after 7, 14 and 21 days but did show an improvement relative to baseline after 28 days of treatment."
7675,840,"Schirmer I, BUT, fluorescein and Rose Bengal did not show any statistical significance in the vehicle group."
7676,840,CONCLUSION: Topical 0.03% tacrolimus eye drop improved tear stability and ocular surface status in cases of inflammatory or SS-related dry eye.
7677,840,TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01850979.
7678,841,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the correlation between MR imaging (MRI) of parotid glands with X-ray sialography, histopathology of the labial salivary glands, and salivary secretion, in patients with secondary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)."
7679,841,"METHODS: Non-contrast MRI of the parotid glands was performed in 13 secondary SS patients associated with RA who satisfied the revised Japanese diagnostic criteria for SS (1999), and the ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA (2010)."
7680,841,"The MRI findings were classified according to the degree of high-intensity signal on T1-weighted images (T1WI) and short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR) images into five grades (0-4), using the modified Nagasaki University grading method."
7681,841,"The results of MRI grading were compared with the Rubin and Holt staging of X-ray sialography (0-4), the Greenspan grading of labial salivary gland histopathology (0-4), and salivary secretion by the gum test (ml/10 min)."
7682,841,"RESULTS: All 13 patients were females, with a mean age of 50.2  11.3 years."
7683,841,"According to the MRI grading, 3 patients were Grade 1, 5 were Grade 2, 5 were Grade 3, and none was Grade 0 or Grade 4."
7684,841,"The mean stage by X-ray sialography was 1.7  1.0, the mean grade by histopathology was 2.4  1.2, and the mean volume of salivary secretion was 9.7  3.9 ml."
7685,841,"The MRI grading correlated significantly with the Rubin and Holt staging and Greenspan grading (P < 0.01 each, Spearman's rank correlation), and significantly and inversely with the results of the gum test (P < 0.05)."
7686,841,CONCLUSION: The results suggest that MRI of the parotid glands is a useful noninvasive tool for evaluating destruction and inflammation in the salivary glands.
7687,842,"The presence of autoantibodies is one of several hallmarks of Sjgren's Syndrome, the detection of serum autoantibodies has a central role in the diagnosis and classification of Sjgren's syndrome."
7688,842,"In this review, we will discuss autoantibodies that are helpful in the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome."
7689,842,"This includes the traditional autoantibodies for disease classification (ANA, Anti-Ro/SSA, Anti-La/SSB, RF), autoantibodies identified from mouse models (Anti-SP1, Anti- PSP, Anti-CA6, and anti-alpha fodrin) and autoantibodies associated with other autoimmune disease (ACA, AMA, and Anti-CCP)."
7690,842,We will also review the methods for the detection of autoantibodies and associated challenges for clinical results reporting.
7691,842,The significance of using an autoantibody panel for the diagnosis of SS will be also be reviewed.
7692,843,BACKGROUND: Retinal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjgren syndrome (SS) may be subclinical and thus underdiagnosed.
7693,843,OBJECTIVES: We aimed at evaluating morphological and functional visual abnormalities in a cohort of SLE and SS patients in the absence of an overt clinical visual impairment.
7694,843,"We also investigated potential associations between retinal disorders and disease activity, organ involvement, and treatment with steroid and/or hydroxychloroquine."
7695,843,METHODS: The study comprised 42 SLE and 36 primary SS patients and 76 healthy controls (HC).
7696,843,"Ophthalmological examination, standard automated perimetry, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and fundus perimetry were performed."
7697,843,"RESULTS: Retinal thickness of the posterior pole was not different between SLE and HC groups, but it was reduced in the SS group compared with both the HC and the SLE group."
7698,843,"In SLE and SS patients, mean defect and pattern standard deviation by standard automated perimetry were higher than in HC."
7699,843,Visual field index values were lower in both SLE and SS patients than in HC.
7700,843,SLE patients with nephritis displayed increased mean defect and pattern standard deviation and reduced visual field index values compared to patients without nephritis.
7701,843,"In SLE and SS patients, fundus perimetry differential sensitivity was reduced, and mean defect values were higher than in HC."
7702,843,"Disturbances in fundus perimetry in the SLE group were more prevalent in steroid-nave patients and in SS patients who received a cumulative hydroxychloroquine dose > 1,000 g. CONCLUSIONS: Functional eye impairment was demonstrated in SLE patients, possibly associated with kidney involvement."
7703,843,"In SLE, corticosteroids might exert a protective role."
7704,843,"Morphological alterations and functional impairment were detected in SS patients, which may be linked to hydroxychloroquine toxicity."
7705,844,OBJECTIVE: Functional ability and participation in life situations are compromised in many primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) patients.
7706,844,"This study aimed to identify the key barriers and priorities to participation in daily living activities, in order to develop potential future interventions."
7707,844,"METHODS: Group concept mapping, a semiquantitative, mixed-methods approach was used to identify and structure ideas from UK primary SS patients, adult household members living with a primary SS patient, and health care professionals."
7708,844,"Brainstorming generated ideas, which were summarized into a final set of statements."
7709,844,Participants individually arranged these statements into themes and rated each statement for importance.
7710,844,"Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis were applied to sorted and rated data to produce visual representations of the ideas (concept maps), enabling identification of agreed priority areas for interventions."
7711,844,"RESULTS: A total of 121 patients, 43 adult household members, and 67 health care professionals took part."
7712,844,"In sum, 463 ideas were distilled down to 94 statements."
7713,844,"These statements were grouped into 7 clusters: Patient Empowerment, Symptoms, Wellbeing, Access and Coordination of Health Care, Knowledge and Support, Public Awareness and Support, and Friends and Family."
7714,844,Patient Empowerment and Symptoms were rated as priority conceptual themes.
7715,844,"Important statements within priority clusters indicate patients should be taken seriously and supported to self-manage symptoms of oral and ocular dryness, fatigue, pain, and poor sleep."
7716,844,"CONCLUSION: Our data highlighted the fact that in addition to managing primary SS symptoms, interventions aiming to improve patient empowerment, general wellbeing, access to health care, patient education, and social support are important to facilitate improved participation in daily living activities."
7717,845,BACKGROUND: Connective tissue diseases (CTD) may be associated with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN).
7718,845,"The prevalence and diagnostic implications of this association are, however, not well established."
7719,845,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate, in TN patients, if rheumatologic clinical and laboratory findings could contribute to the early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases."
7720,845,"METHODS: Forty-six consecutive TN patients, 67% female, mean disease duration 8.78 +/- 7.25 years, and 47 controls were initially interviewed using a standard questionnaire based on common signs/symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjgren syndrome, mixed CTD, and systemic sclerosis."
7721,845,Autoantibodies were detected by standard techniques.
7722,845,Those with rheumatologic complaints or positive autoantibodies were referred to the Rheumatology Outpatient Clinic for a more detailed evaluation.
7723,845,Secondary causes of TN were excluded.
7724,845,RESULTS: The frequency of Raynaud phenomenon (P = 0.026) and ANA reactivity (P = 0.04) were significantly higher in TN patients compared with controls.
7725,845,Fourteen TN patients were ANA positive.
7726,845,"Seven of them reported concomitant rheumatic complaints, and interestingly, diffuse CTD was diagnosed in 4 (57%) of these patients: 1 systemic lupus erythematosus; 2 Sjgren syndrome; and 1 undifferentiated disease with scleritis and positive parotid scintigraphy."
7727,845,"In all cases, TN preceded by at least 10 months the rheumatologic signs/symptoms."
7728,845,"Moreover, these 4 TN patients with CTD had a higher frequency of sicca symptoms (P = 0.001) and higher titers of ANA (>or=1:320) (P = 0.006) than the remaining 42 TN patients without CTD diagnoses."
7729,845,"Sixteen patients had isolated laboratory or clinical abnormalities, and none of them had CTD diagnoses."
7730,845,CONCLUSIONS: The concomitant presence of sicca symptoms and high titer ANA are clues for the early investigation of rheumatic diseases in TN patients.
7731,846,PURPOSE: To analyze the levels of diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap(4)A) and diadenosine pentaphosphate (Ap(5)A) in tears of subjects with Sjgren syndrome and to compare them with those in a control group.
7732,846,METHODS: Twelve subjects with a diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome and 20 healthy control subjects were invited to participate in the present study.
7733,846,Schirmer strips were used to measure tear secretion (Schirmer I test) and to collect tears.
7734,846,"Ap(4)A and Ap(5)A were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and a dry eye questionnaire (DEQ) was used to evaluate dry eye symptomatology."
7735,846,"RESULTS: The mean concentrations of Ap(4)A and Ap(5)A in the Sjgren syndrome group were 2.54  1.02 and 26.13  6.95 M, respectively."
7736,846,This group of patients was divided in two subgroups: four patients with normal tear production and eight patients with low tear production.
7737,846,"Concentrations of Ap(4)A, and Ap(5)A in patients with normal tear production (Schirmer test result, 12.3  1.2 mm) were 0.47  0.20 and 8.03  3.27 M, respectively."
7738,846,"In the patients with low tear production (Schirmer test result, 1.0  0.3 mm), the concentrations were 4.09  1.36 and 39.51  8.46 M, respectively and in the control group, 0.13  0.03 and 0.04  0.02 M, respectively."
7739,846,"CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Sjgren syndrome have abnormally elevated concentrations of diadenosine polyphosphates, indicating that these compounds could be used in the diagnosis of this disease."
7740,847,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the characteristics and the prevalence of histopathologic and immunohistochemical changes in vulvar biopsies, in women with Primary Sjgren Syndrome (pSS) and non-Sjgren Sicca Syndrome (nS-SS)."
7741,847,"Twenty-one women with pSS and 11 with nS-SS (investigated by xerophtalmia and xerostomia tests, biopsy of minor salivary glands, gynecological history, and gynecologic symptoms score) underwent vulvar biopsies, evaluated for histopathologic and immunohistochemicalchanges, and compared with those obtained from 26 patients with lichen sclerosus."
7742,847,An inflammatory infiltrate was present in 31/32 biopsies (96.9%); biopsies from pSS patients showed a mild infiltrate in 10 cases and a moderate infiltrate in 11 cases; and patients with nS-SS had a mild infiltrate in 8 biopsies and moderate infiltrate in the other 2 biopsies.
7743,847,"By immunohistochemistry, the infiltrate was composed predominantly of T lymphocytes (CD3), CD20 B cells were sparse and mean CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio was 1.5."
7744,847,No differences were observed between the grading of the inflammatory infiltrate in nS-SS and pSS; no correlation was shown between vulvar inflammatory infiltrate score (mild or moderate) and salivary glands inflammatory score.
7745,847,"No differences were found in gynecologic symptoms, as well as in clinical and demographical characteristics between patients with mild and those with moderate vulvar inflammatory score."
7746,847,"A higher prevalence of moderate inflammatory infiltrate was observed in biopsies from women with lichen sclerosus than in pSS and nS-SS patients (61.5% vs. 27.5%, P=0.02)."
7747,847,Women with pSS and nS-SS show a high and similar prevalence of vulvar inflammatory infiltrate.
7748,847,"A gynecologic evaluation is needed both in pSS and nS-SS to assess genital involvement and, eventually, to address a therapy targeted to genital symptoms."
7749,848,"To evaluate the effectiveness of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in the treatment of xerostomia in primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS), a randomized clinical trial of patients with dry mouth symptoms associated with primary SS receiving care at a university hospital was conducted."
7750,848,"Sixty-six patients were randomly assigned with a 1:1 allocation ratio to receive LLLT (laser group, n=33) or placebo treatment (placebo group, n=33)."
7751,848,"Patients in the laser group received LLLT twice a week for 6weeks, for a total of 12 treatment sessions."
7752,848,"Laser irradiation was performed with an aluminum-gallium-arsenide laser diode at a wavelength of 808nm, 100-mW output power, and energy density of 4.0J/cm(2) per irradiation point per session."
7753,848,"Placebo treatment was performed following the same protocol used for irradiated patients and using the same laser device to mimic a real irradiation, but with no active laser emission and the tip of the laser probe covered with aluminum foil."
7754,848,"The outcomes of interest were xerostomia inventory scores, salivary flow rate, salivary beta-2 microglobulin levels, and salivary sodium and chlorine concentrations."
7755,848,Patients in both groups showed no improvement in xerostomia.
7756,848,"Likewise, there was no significant improvement in xerostomia inventory scores (p=0.301) or salivary flow rate (p=0.643) in either group."
7757,848,"There was no difference in salivary beta-2 microglobulin levels, sodium concentration, and chlorine concentration before and after intervention or between the two groups."
7758,848,The LLLT protocol used in this study effected no improvement in xerostomia or salivary flow rate in patients with primary SS.
7759,848,ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02066896.
7760,849,"Both sarcoidosis and primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) are multisystem disorders of unknown etiology, which share certain clinical features, making the differential diagnosis a real challenge in clinical practice."
7761,849,Several published case reports and case series have posed the question as to whether there is a real association - mimicry between the two diseases or it is just coincidence.
7762,849,"We attempt, after systematic and comprehensive research of the relevant published literature, to present all those data, clinical or paraclinical, which could be useful in the diagnostic approach and the distinguishment of the two diseases."
7763,849,"It is certain that, besides the classic diagnostic methods, emerging is the role of immunology and genetics on this direction, although not established yet."
7764,850,"Chronic acquired demyelinating polyneuropathies may be refractory to conventional therapy including corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin (Ig) or require long-term immunotherapy to maintain remission."
7765,850,"Use of alternative approaches such as Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, in the treatment of demyelinating polyneuropathy, unrelated to IgM gammopathy and myelin-associated glycoprotein antibodies, has been the subject of only a few case reports."
7766,850,"We report the case of a 79-year-old woman with a distal acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy in the context of Sjgren's syndrome, IgG paraproteinemia, and occult lymphoma who has had an excellent and durable response to Rituximab therapy."
7767,851,Ultrasound elastography (UE) is a non-invasive imaging method that allows the assessment of tissue elastic property.
7768,851,Different UE techniques are currently available (i.e.
7769,851,"strain UE and acoustic radiation force impulse UE), with several potential clinical applications."
7770,851,Recent studies investigated the role of UE in two systemic rheumatic diseases and psoriasis.
7771,851,This research added interesting information to the already known applications of UE in the assessment of tendinopathies.
7772,851,"In SS, acoustic radiation force impulse UE has shown a potential role in the diagnosis of the disease, with lower sensitivity than and similar specificity to salivary gland histology."
7773,851,"In SSc, a potential use of UE in screening pre-clinical disease has been reported."
7774,851,"In psoriasis, the use of strain UE in evaluating treatment response has been highlighted."
7775,851,"UE is a promising tool in rheumatology, with a potential role in the evaluation of various tissues and pathologies."
7776,852,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) or sicca syndrome was described by Swedish ophthalmologist Sjgren in the year 1933 for the first time.
7777,852,The etiology of the SS is multifunctional and includes a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental as well as epigenetic factors.
7778,852,"It is an autoimmune disease characterized by features of systemic autoimmunity, dysfunction, and inflammation in the exocrine glands (mainly salivary and lacrimal glands) and lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands."
7779,852,"In fact, the involvement of lacrimal and salivary glands results in the typical features of dry eye and salivary dysfunction (xerostomia)."
7780,852,Only in one-third of the patients also present systemic extraglandular manifestations.
7781,852,"T cells were originally considered to play the initiating role in the autoimmune process, while B cells were restricted to autoantibody production."
7782,852,"In recent years, it is understood that the roles of B cells are multiple."
7783,852,"Moreover, autoantibodies and blood B cell analysis are major contributors to a clinical diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome."
7784,852,"Recently, there has been rising interest in microRNA implication in autoimmunity."
7785,852,"Unfortunately, to date, there are only a few studies that have investigated their participation in SS etiopathogenesis."
7786,852,The purpose of this work is to gather the data present in the literature to clarify this complex topic.
7787,853,We have reported characteristic cutaneous manifestations of Sjgren syndrome (SS) with special references to autoimmune anhidrosis or hypoidrosis and related mucocutaenous manifestations in addition to annular erythema or cutaneous vasculitis.
7788,853,"Although significance of cutaneous manifestations of SS has been gradually recognized in rheumatologists, sudomotor function has not been fully evaluated and recognized in the diagnosis of SS except for dermatologists."
7789,853,"SS is a relatively underestimated collagen disease in contrast to SLE, systemic sclerosis, or dermatomyositis, special care should be needed not to make misdiagnosis of SS when we see the patients with common skin disease such as, drug eruption, infections skin disease or xerosis in the daily practice."
7790,853,"In contrast to pathomechanisms of dry skin observed in SS, we recently reported that reduced sweating function and dry skin seen in atopic dermatitis (AD) are mediated by histamine or substance P, those are usually restored to normal levels after improvement of the dermatitis by topical corticosteroid ointment with or without oral anti-histamine."
7791,853,"Therefore, xerotic skin lesions seen in SS and AD might be attributable to different pathomechanisms with similar dry skin manifestations."
7792,853,We recently reported that SS promotes dry skin when complicated with AD possibly due to acceleration of hypoidrosis.
7793,853,"In this review, we would like to summarize our recent understanding of regulatory mechanism of impaired sweating function in allergic inflammatory skin diseases by introducing clinical presentations of AD/SS overlap cases as the model of hypoidrotic inflammatory skin diseases."
7794,854,Mouse models have been widely used to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of human diseases.
7795,854,"The advantages of using these models include the ability to study different stages of the disease with particular respect to specific target organs, to focus on the role of specific pathogenic factors and to investigate the effect of possible therapeutic interventions."
7796,854,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease, characterised by lymphocytic infiltrates in the salivary and lacrimal glands."
7797,854,"To date, effective therapy is not available and treatment has been mainly symptomatic."
7798,854,Ongoing studies in murine models are aimed at developing more effective and targeted therapies in SS.
7799,854,"The heterogeneity of SS will most probably benefit from optimising therapies, tailored to specific subgroups of the disease."
7800,854,"In this review, we provide our perspective on the importance of subdividing SS patients according to their interferon signature, and recommend choosing appropriate mouse models for interferon-positive and interferon-negative SS subtypes."
7801,854,Murine models better resembling human-disease phenotypes will be essential in this endeavour.
7802,855,PURPOSE: To evaluate morphologic changes in meibomian glands (MGs) and the status of periglandular inflammation in patients with primary and secondary Sjgren's Syndrome (SS) using in vivo confocal laser microscopy (LSCM).
7803,855,"METHODS: Twenty patients with primary SS (SSI), 25 with secondary SS (SSII), 20 with MG dysfunction (MGD), and 25 age- and gender-matched control subjects were enrolled consecutively."
7804,855,"Each participant completed an Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire and underwent a full eye examination, including tear film break-up time (BUT), fluorescein and lissamine green staining, Schirmer test, and an LSCM examination of the MGs, the last to determine acinar unit density and diameter, glandular orifice diameters, meibum secretion reflectivity, inhomogeneous appearance of glandular interstice, and acinar wall."
7805,855,"RESULTS: All parameters indicated statistically significant differences among groups (P < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test)."
7806,855,LSCM demonstrated no differences between SSI and SSII (Mann-Whitney U test).
7807,855,"Compared with control subjects, SS subjects' MGs showed more periglandular inflammation and higher secretion reflectivity (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test)."
7808,855,"Compared with MGD patients, SS patients' MGs had higher acinar density, smaller diameters, greater density of periglandular inflammatory cells, and lower secretion reflectivity (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test)."
7809,855,"In SS patients, the two measured confocal signs of inflammation were significantly interrelated and correlated with corneal fluorescein staining (P  0.01, Spearman correlation coefficient)."
7810,855,Acinar density and diameters were strongly correlated among themselves (P < 0.001) and with BUT (P < 0.05).
7811,855,CONCLUSIONS: LSCM is capable of effectively revealing morphologic and inflammatory changes in MGs and showed discernible patterns of MG abnormalities in SS and MGD not easily distinguishable by the usual clinical exams.
7812,856,OBJECTIVE: We used the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and the European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) articular domain to assess the effect of rituximab (RTX) and abatacept (ABA) on articular involvement in primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS).
7813,856,METHODS: Patients with pSS treated with RTX (n = 18) or ABA (n = 13) and having a DAS28 erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)/C-reactive protein (CRP) level  3.2 at baseline were selected.
7814,856,Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the DAS28 and ESSDAI articular domain over time.
7815,856,"RESULTS: In the RTX group, DAS28-ESR/CRP decreased significantly up to 48 weeks."
7816,856,"In the ABA group, DAS28-ESR/CRP decreased significantly up to 24 weeks."
7817,856,DAS28 correlated significantly with ESSDAI articular domain.
7818,856,CONCLUSION: DAS28 is useful to evaluate the effect of biologicals on articular involvement in patients with pSS.
7819,857,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune exocrinopathy associated with variable degree of lymphocytic infiltration of the affected organs (primarily salivary and lacrimal glands) and broad clinical manifestations.
7820,857,"Minor salivary gland (MSG) lesions mainly consist of T and B cells, while antigen-presenting cells have been reported in heavy infiltrates."
7821,857,"Evidence suggests that the infiltrate composition differs according to lesion severity; however, these differences are not well-defined."
7822,857,"To investigate the differential distribution of the major infiltrating mononuclear cell (MNC) types in SS-lesions of variable severity, total-T, CD4(+)-T, CD8(+)-T, Treg, and B cell, macrophage (MPhi), interdigitating (iDC) and follicular dendritic cell (fDC), and natural-killer (NK)-cell incidence (%-total infiltrating MNC) was analyzed in MSG biopsies with mild (n = 11), intermediate (n = 13) or severe (n = 15) lesions."
7823,857,"T cells, CD4(+)-T cells and Tregs, B lymphocytes, MPhis and iDCs were significantly different among MSG tissues with mild, intermediate or severe inflammatory lesions, while CD8(+)-T cell, fDC and NK cell incidence was not correlated with lesion severity."
7824,857,"T cell, CD4(+)-T cell, T/B cell ratio and iDC incidence was negatively, whereas B cell and MPhi incidence was positively correlated with infiltration grade and biopsy focus score."
7825,857,Tregs predominated in intermediate lesions.
7826,857,"Multivariate analysis revealed several associations between the incidence of each infiltrating MNC-type and disease manifestations, implying an involvement of local immune responses in systemic disease features."
7827,857,Our findings support that the distribution of infiltrating MNCs at the SS-lesions varies according to lesion severity and correlates with disease manifestations.
7828,857,The significance of this differential distribution and the underlying aetiopathogenic factors need to be elucidated.
7829,858,Primary Sggren's syndrome (SSP) is one of the most common connective tissue disorder with an estimated prevalence between 0.6 and 1.7% of the general population.
7830,858,"Lymphocytic infiltration of salivary gland is easily accessible favoring the diagnosis, and clinical and fundamental research."
7831,858,"However, while many advances have been obtained in the recent decades, the pathophysiology of SSP remains unclear combining environmental factors with genetic predisposition."
7832,858,"A central role tends to be attributed to salivary gland epithelial cells, originally designated as ""innocent bystanders"" and to B cells through the intervention of survey factors like BAFF."
7833,858,"New T cells subsets are also carefully studied, particularly natural T regulatory and Th17 cells."
7834,858,They could indeed represent new therapeutic targets.
7835,859,OBJECTIVES: Longitudinal myelitis in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a rarely reported occurrence.
7836,859,"Here, we present a patient with longitudinal myelitis who was found to have both primary SS and a positive antibody to aquaporin-4 (NMO-IgG)."
7837,859,"We review the recent literature concerning the overlap between primary SS-associated myelitis and the presence of NMO-IgG, suggestive of a neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD)."
7838,859,"METHODS: A patient with longitudinal myelitis, SS, and a positive NMO-IgG is presented."
7839,859,A review of the relevant English literature based on a PubMed and Embase search is then discussed.
7840,859,"The keywords used were Sjgren's syndrome, myelitis (longitudinal and transverse), neuromyelitis optica, and Devic's disease."
7841,859,RESULTS: Our patient fulfills the criteria for both primary SS and NMOSD.
7842,859,Several small studies have shown that most SS patients with longitudinal myelitis are positive for the antibody to aquaporin-4.
7843,859,"Additionally, minor salivary gland biopsies of patients with NMO or NMOSD have evidence of lymphocytic inflammation, suggesting that there may be an overlap in the mechanism of NMOSD and longitudinal myelitis secondary to primary SS."
7844,859,This overlap in mechanism may have important ramifications with regard to prognosis and treatment of SS-related myelitis.
7845,859,CONCLUSION: The presentation of longitudinal myelitis in a patient with SS should be considered a possible NMOSD.
7846,859,Checking for the presence antiaquaporin-4 antibodies provides important prognostic information and may help to guide treatment decisions.
7847,860,OBJECTIVE: Mikulicz's disease (MD) is differentiated from Sjgren's syndrome as an immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) systemic disease.
7848,860,MD patients often report olfactory dysfunction (OD).
7849,860,"To analyze cases of OD associated with MD, we studied clinicopathological and serological findings of MD patients."
7850,860,METHODS: A total of 44 MD patients (17 males and 27 females) were examined for OD.
7851,860,We evaluated clinicopathological and serological findings of these patients by dividing them into OD(+) and OD(-) groups.
7852,860,RESULTS: The mean IgG4 concentration (SD) in such cases was 950.5 (797.5)mg/dl.
7853,860,"Of the 44 patients, 20 (45%) had OD even though no abnormalities, such as obstructive and inflammatory disease, were detected in their nasal cavities and sinuses."
7854,860,"The two groups did not show significant differences in background characteristics, such as age, sex, IgG4 concentration, presence or absence of allergic rhinitis, and presence or absence of extrasalivary gland lesions."
7855,860,We found abundant IgG4-positive plasmacytes in the nasal mucosa specimens of the OD(+) group but not in that of the OD(-) group.
7856,860,CONCLUSIONS: Nasal mucosa in the MD patients with OD was infiltrated with IgG4-positive plasmacytes.
7857,860,We concluded that OD may be associated with infiltration by IgG4-positive cells.
7858,861,"Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systematic lupus erythematosus and Sjgren's syndrome, are a group of diseases characterized by the activation of immune cells and excessive production of autoantibodies."
7859,861,"Although the pathogenesis of these diseases is still not completely understood, studies have shown that multiple factors including genetics, environment and immune responses play important roles in the development and progression of the diseases."
7860,861,"In China, there are great achievements in the mechanisms of autoimmune diseases during the last decades."
7861,861,These studies provide new insight to understand the diseases and also shed light on the development of novel therapy.
7862,862,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although brain involvement is common in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), results from cerebral imaging studies are inconsistent."
7863,862,This study aimed to perform both voxel-wise and global brain volume analyses in a nearly population-based pSS cohort to explore whether the patients displayed any focal or diffuse volume differences compared with healthy subjects.
7864,862,METHODS: Global grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes were measured and compared in 60 patients with pSS and 60 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects.
7865,862,Regression models were constructed with potential explanatory variables for GM and WM volumes.
7866,862,"In the same groups, voxel-wise morphometric analyses were performed."
7867,862,"RESULTS: In analyses of global GM and WM, the patients had lower WM volumes than healthy subjects (540  63 cm(3) vs. 564  56 cm(3), P = 0.02), but no differences in GM."
7868,862,Voxel-wise analyses displayed no localized areas of GM or WM volume differences between pSS patients and healthy subjects.
7869,862,CONCLUSION: Individuals with pSS have a diffuse reduction of cerebral WM but no localized loss of WM or GM.
7870,862,This indicates a general deleterious effect on WM due to pSS itself.
7871,863,"Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the salivary and lacrimal glands, but it can also have extra-glandular manifestations."
7872,863,"Although pain has not yet been fully studied and characterized, it is a symptom that can be often found in patients with SjS, who mainly complain of neuropathic pain, followed by nociceptive pain."
7873,863,The latter when combined with widespread dysfunctional symptoms is defined fibromyalgia.
7874,863,The aim of this work is to analyze the scientific literature on the presence of pain in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome.
7875,864,OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the addition of salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) or replacement of current criteria items by SGUS influences the performance of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria for primary Sjgren's syndrome.
7876,864,METHODS: Included were consecutive patients with complete data on all ACR/EULAR items (n = 243) who underwent SGUS in our primary Sjgren's syndrome expertise center.
7877,864,Clinical diagnosis by the treating physician was used as the gold standard.
7878,864,Separate analyses were performed for patients who underwent labial or parotid gland biopsies.
7879,864,The average score for hypoechogenic areas in 1 parotid and 1 submandibular gland was determined (range 0-3).
7880,864,"Next, performance of the ACR/EULAR criteria was evaluated after addition of SGUS or replacement of current items by SGUS."
7881,864,RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an optimal cutoff value of 1.5 for SGUS.
7882,864,The optimal weight for SGUS positivity was 1.
7883,864,Cutoff for ACR/EULAR fulfilment remained 4.
7884,864,"In patients who underwent a labial gland biopsy (n = 124), the original criteria showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.965, sensitivity of 95.9%, and specificity of 92.2%."
7885,864,"After the addition of SGUS, the AUC was 0.966, with a sensitivity of 97.3% and specificity of 90.2%."
7886,864,"In patients who underwent a parotid gland biopsy (n = 198), similar results were found."
7887,864,"Sensitivity of the criteria decreased substantially when SGUS replaced salivary gland biopsy or anti-SSA antibodies, while performance remained equal when SGUS replaced the ocular staining score, Schirmer's test, or unstimulated whole saliva flow."
7888,864,CONCLUSION: Validity of the ACR/EULAR criteria remains high after incorporation of SGUS.
7889,864,"With SGUS, clinicians are offered a larger array of tests to evaluate fulfillment of the ACR/EULAR criteria."
7890,865,"There are contradictory opinions if late-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with a different, more benign disease course and better prognosis than early-onset SLE."
7891,865,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical manifestations, course, treatment, and prognosis of late-onset SLE."
7892,865,"Patients who developed SLE after/or at the age of 50 years were considered late-onset SLE and compared to a group of randomly selected patients aged younger than 50 years at the diagnosis, matched for disease duration."
7893,865,Lower frequency of cutaneous manifestations (p = 0.01) and higher frequency of cytopenias (p = 0.02) were registrated at the SLE onset in the late-onset group.
7894,865,"Atypical clinical presentation of SLE contributed to a longer delay of diagnosis in late-onset SLE patients (p = 0.005), who fullfiled less American College of Rheumatology criteria at the diagnosis (p = 0.022)."
7895,865,"Cumulative incidence of clinical manifestations showed lower frequency of cutaneous (p = 0.017), neuropsychiatric manifestations (p = 0.021), lupus nephritis (p = 0.006), and higher frequency of Sjogren's syndrome (p = 0.025) in the late-onset group."
7896,865,Late-onset SLE patients received lower doses of corticosteroid (p = 0.006) and cyclophosphamide (p = 0.001) and had more cyclophosphamide-induced complications (p = 0.005).
7897,865,"Higher prevalence of comorbid conditions in the late-onset group (p = 0.025), and higher Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology damage index was noticed (p = 0.018)."
7898,865,"Despite the less major organ involvement and more benign course of disease, late-onset SLE has poorer prognosis, because of the higher frequency of comorbid conditions and higher organ damage, due to the aging and longer exposition to a classical vascular risk factors."
7899,866,The association between microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) has seldom been reported.
7900,866,"We describe here a patient who presented with sensorimotor neuropathy along with hypothyroidism, renal failure and liver dysfunction."
7901,866,"Detection of antinuclear antibodies at a titer of 1/800, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-GP210, anti-microsomial and p-ANCA anti-myeloperoxydase antibodies along with renal, salivary and liver biopsy led to a diagnosis of MPA associated with PBC, Sjogren's syndrome and Hashimoto's thyroiditis."
7902,867,BACKGROUND: To examine the roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the regulation of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and reveal the expression profile of lncRNAs in labial salivary glands (LSGs) in pSS patients.
7903,867,"METHOD: The expression of 63,431 lncRNAs and 39,887 mRNAs were determined in the LSG of four pSS patients and four healthy controls using microarray experiments."
7904,867,Validation was performed in 30 pSS patients and 16 controls using real-time PCR.
7905,867,LncRNA-mRNA co-expression and gene-pathway networks were constructed using bioinformatics software.
7906,867,"RESULT: A total of 1243 lncRNAs (upregulated: 890, downregulated: 353) and 1457 mRNAs (upregulated: 1141, downregulated: 316) were differentially expressed in the LSGs of pSS patients (fold change >2, P <0.05)."
7907,867,Eight of these lncRNAs were validated using real-time PCR.
7908,867,"ENST00000420219.1 (3.13-fold), ENST00000455309.1 (2.51-fold), n336161 (2.45-fold), NR_002712 (2.41-fold), ENST00000546086.1 (1.94-fold), Lnc-UTS2D-1:1 (1.79-fold), n340599 (1.69-fold), and TCONS_l2_00014794 (1.28-fold) were significantly upregulated in pSS."
7909,867,"There were strong correlations between these lncRNAs and 2 microglobulin, disease course, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF), IgA, IgM, visual analogue scale (VAS) of parotid swelling and VAS of dry eyes."
7910,867,"Computational analyses revealed that 28 of the differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs were associated with eight DE lncRNAs involved in chemokine signaling pathways, the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) signaling pathway, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway."
7911,867,CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed the expression profile of lncRNAs in LSGs of pSS patients.
7912,867,Many novel lncRNA transcripts that play important roles in the pathogenesis of pSS were dysregulated in pSS.
7913,867,"Therefore, this study will aid in the development of new diagnostic biomarkers and drug therapies."
7914,868,Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Liujin Runzao Concentrated Decoction (LRCD) for the treatment of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
7915,868,Methods Forty pSS patients with fluid depletion and distribution obstacles syndrome (FDDOS) were randomly assigned to the experimen- tal group and the control group according to 1:1 proportion.
7916,868,"All patients received standard therapy: Radix Paeoniae alba total glycosides 600 mg, twice per day."
7917,868,"Patients in the experimental group additionally took LRCD, 30 mL each time, twice per day."
7918,868,"The therapeutic course for all was 4 weeks, and two courses for all."
7919,868,The improvement of dry mouth and dry eyes were comprehensively evaluated.
7920,868,"Each outcome of composite index constitutions (integrals of dry eyes and dry mouth, salivary flow rate, Schirmer test) was respectively reported."
7921,868,Schirmer test and salivary flow rate were determined as well.
7922,868,"Score of TCM syndrome, blood sedimentation,'immunoglobulin, and adverse drug reactions were observed."
7923,868,"Results The effective rate of comprehensive effect for dry eyes and dry mouth improvement at the end of 8 weeks was 80% in the experimental group and 35% in the control group, with statistical difference (X =8."

7926,868,As for the composition of comprehensive effect for dry eyes and dry mouth improvement: The score for dry eyes and dry mouth decreased in the two groups more after treatment than before treatment.
7927,868,The difference in pre-post treatment score for dry eyes and dry mouth at week 8 was higher in the experimental group than in the control group.

7950,869,"OBJECTIVE: The usefulness of positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) with (18) F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose ((18) F-FDG) for the diagnosis of lymphoma in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is unclear, since the abnormalities it reveals may be due to systemic manifestations of SS."
7951,869,This study was undertaken to compare (18) F-FDG-PET-CT in patients with primary SS with lymphoma and those without lymphoma in order to identify patterns associated with lymphoma.
7952,869,METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in 2 centers and included patients who met the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism 2016 criteria for primary SS and had undergone PET-CT. Two independent readers who were blinded with regard to lymphoma diagnosis analyzed PET-CT scans.
7953,869,Abnormalities were compared between patients with and those without lymphoma.
7954,869,"RESULTS: Of the 45 patients included, 15 had lymphoma."
7955,869,"Compared to patients without lymphoma, the mean size (P = 0.048) and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) (P = 0.001) of the parotid glands were higher in patients with lymphoma."
7956,869,"FDG uptake in the lymph nodes was observed in 53.3% of the patients with lymphoma and 43.3% of the patients without lymphoma, with no difference in the number of sites, uptake pattern, or mean SUVmax."
7957,869,Focal pulmonary uptake (nodules or condensations) was observed in 5 of the patients with lymphoma (33.3%) but only 1 patient without lymphoma (3.3%) (P = 0.01).
7958,869,"Having an SUVmax in the parotid gland of 4.7 and/or the presence of focal pulmonary lesions was highly suggestive of lymphoma (sensitivity 80%, specificity 83.3%)."
7959,869,"CONCLUSION: Some systemic manifestations of primary SS (lymphadenopathy, pulmonary involvement, and salivary gland involvement) can be visualized by PET-CT. Involvement of the lymph nodes and parotid glands is commonly observed with a similar frequency in SS patients with and those without lymphoma."
7960,869,An SUVmax in the parotid glands of 4.7 and/or the presence of focal lung lesions are associated with the diagnosis of lymphoma.
7961,870,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) and to study the association of COPD with cigarette smoking, radiographic features, respiratory symptoms, disease activity, and laboratory inflammatory and serological features in patients with pSS."
7962,870,"METHODS: Fifty-one consecutive patients with pSS (mean age 60 yrs, range 29-82 yrs, 49 women) were assessed by pulmonary function tests (PFT)."
7963,870,"The PFT results were compared with previously studied population-based controls, standardizing results with regard to sex, age, height, weight, and cigarette smoking."
7964,870,"In addition, patients with pSS were assessed by computed tomography of the chest, the European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren Syndrome Disease Activity Index and Patient Reported Index, the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (which evaluates respiratory symptoms), and by laboratory inflammatory and serological tests."
7965,870,RESULTS: Forty-one percent of all patients with pSS and 30% of the never-smoking patients with pSS fulfilled the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria for COPD.
7966,870,"Vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/VC ratio, and DLCO were significantly decreased while residual volume (RV) and the RV/total lung capacity ratio were significantly increased in patients with pSS."
7967,870,"Moderate correlations between PFT results, symptoms, and disease activity were found."
7968,870,"However, laboratory inflammatory and serological features were poorly associated with PFT results in patients with pSS."
7969,870,"CONCLUSION: COPD was a common finding in patients with pSS, even among never-smoking patients."
7970,870,"An obstructive pattern was the predominant PFT finding in patients with pSS, although a superimposed restrictive lung disease could not be excluded."
7971,870,The results suggest that the disease per se is involved in the development of COPD in pSS.
7972,871,AIMS: To determine whether prognostic immunological profiles predict the severity of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
7973,871,METHODS: 121 patients diagnosed with SS and followed for at least 1 year were enrolled in this study.
7974,871,Patients were allocated to either a mild KCS group (Mi-KCS; n=65) or to a moderate to severe KCS group (MS-KCS; n=56) based on the Oxford scheme and response to treatment.
7975,871,These groups were each sub-divided into two groups based on the clinical severity of KCS and the presence of associated rheumatic disease (primary SS vs secondary SS).
7976,871,"Anti-Ro/anti-La antibody, rheumatoid factor and tear interleukin (IL)-17 levels and Schirmer test results were compared between each group."
7977,871,RESULTS: Anti-Ro/SSA antibody and anti-La/SSB antibody concentrations were significantly higher in the MS-KCS group than in the Mi-KCS group for total and primary SS.
7978,871,The presence of anti-La/SSB antibody was significantly higher in the MS-KCS than the Mi-KCS group for total and primary SS.
7979,871,The mean tear IL-17 concentration in the MS-KCS group was significantly higher than in the Mi-KCS group for both total SS and primary SS patients.
7980,871,"CONCLUSION: Serum anti-La/SSB antibody, serum anti-Ro/SSA antibody and tear IL-17 are likely to be strongly involved in the clinical severity of KCS in patients with primary SS."
7981,872,OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy effects subjective and/or objective complaints and salivary flow rates of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS).
7982,872,"STUDY DESIGN: Thirty women recently diagnosed with PSS, scheduled for HCQ treatment (400 mg daily), participated and were clinically examined before initiation of 30 weeks of HCQ treatment."
7983,872,"During baseline evaluation, both the objective and/or subjective oral findings were recorded."
7984,872,Unstimulated (uSFR) and stimulated salivary flow rates (sSFR) were determined.
7985,872,"After initiation of HCQ treatment, study parameters were assessed at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 weeks."
7986,872,Each patient served as her own control; measurements of the baseline and control times were analyzed by ANOVA.
7987,872,"RESULTS: uSFR values increased significantly with HCQ treatment, but sSFR values, objective and/or subjective complaints did not change considerably."
7988,872,CONCLUSION: A positive impact of 30 weeks of HCQ treatment only on uSFRs of SS patients was revealed.
7989,873,"BACKGROUND: In this report, we present the results of a severe case of Sjgren's syndrome-related keratopathy after fluocinolone acetonide 190-g intravitreal implant (Iluvien; Alimera Sciences Inc.) therapy."
7990,873,CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old Caucasian woman with Sjgren's syndrome secondary to autoimmune hepatitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis was admitted to our emergency department owing to bilateral corneal ulcers and corneal perforation in the left eye following exposure keratopathy in an artificially induced coma.
7991,873,"Within the following months, recurrent fulminant keratolysis with perforations required multiple penetrating keratoplasties and amniotic membrane transplants in both eyes."
7992,873,"With new signs of severe keratolysis, an intravitreal fluocinolone acetonide implant was injected off-label in the left eye, and a third penetrating keratoplasty was performed 2 weeks later."
7993,873,"In the 6 months of follow-up after the last penetrating keratoplasty, no more surgical interventions were needed in the eye with the fluocinolone acetonide implant."
7994,873,"The corneal surface remained stable, and intraocular pressure was normal."
7995,873,"During this time frame, two further penetrating keratoplasties, one vitrectomy, and five amniotic membrane transplants were performed in the fellow eye owing to relapsing keratolysis and perforations."
7996,873,"CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal therapy in a patient with corneal disease."
7997,873,"In the 6-month follow-up period, no surgical intervention was needed in the eye with the fluocinolone acetonide implant, whereas further penetrating keratoplasties and amniotic membrane transplants were performed in the fellow eye."
7998,873,Intravitreal fluocinolone acetonide may be considered as a treatment option in severe cases of autoimmune corneal disease.
7999,874,We present a case report of a patient with Sjgren's syndrome accompanied with interstitial cystitis.
8000,874,"A 64-year-old woman complained of dry mouth for 21years, recurrent swelling and pain on the right parotid in 2000, and urinary irritation symptoms in the past 2years."
8001,874,Several courses of different types of antibiotics could not relieve her urinary irritation symptoms.
8002,874,Bladder hydraulic dilatation had only transient effects.
8003,874,"Urine sediment contained neither erythrocytes nor leukocytes, and urine cultures yielded no growth."
8004,874,"However, increased -globulin, positive antinuclear antibodies, and anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibodies were detected."
8005,874,Histopathological data of labial salivary glands showed three foci of numerous mononuclear cells.
8006,874,"Cystoscopy revealed redness, edema, angiectasis, and extensive ecchymosis of the mucosal surface and several small floating cruor entities in the bladder."
8007,874,"Urinary bladder biopsy specimens revealed the absence of urothelium and edematous lamina propria and submucosa, with diffuse or multiple focal chronic inflammatory cell infiltration."
8008,874,"Based on these findings, she was diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome accompanied with interstitial cystitis."
8009,874,Therapy with corticosteroids relieved the symptoms significantly.
8010,875,"MicroRNAs are endogenous non-coding RNAs, approximately 22 nucleotides in length."
8011,875,They regulate gene expression and are important in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes.
8012,875,MicroRNA expression is tightly regulated during hematopoiesis and lymphoid cell differentiation and disruption of the entire microRNA network or selected microRNAs may lead to dysregulated immune responses.
8013,875,"Abnormalities in microRNA expression related to inflammatory cytokines, Th-17 and regulatory T cells as well as B cells have been described in several autoimmune diseases."
8014,875,Sjogren's syndrome is characterized by features of systemic autoimmunity and chronic inflammation and dysfunction in exocrine organs.
8015,875,"Its clinical characteristics along with the relatively easy access to the target tissue and its product makes Sjgren's syndrome appealing to study many aspects of microRNAs in a systemic autoimmune disease, such as their potential as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and their role in pathogenesis of autoimmunity, inflammation or organ dysfunction."
8016,875,Encouraging preliminary data from pilot studies in Sjogren's syndrome demonstrate the potential of microRNAs as putative diagnostic and prognostic biomarker candidates which should be tested in larger more definite studies.
8017,875,Combining the comparison of microRNA expression profiles between various clinical subsets of Sjgren's syndrome with bioinformatic modeling tools may predict formerly unsuspected pathways which may contribute to the disease process and lead to the generation of testable novel hypothesis of pathogenesis.
8018,876,"BACKGROUND: Labial salivary gland biopsy (LSGB) is the most important diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS), but its diagnostic value is rarely studied."
8019,876,"This study assessed the sensibility and specificity of LSGB, and the clinical profiles of patients who were referred for biopsy."
8020,876,METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the histopathological reports from LSGB and medical report data from patients who underwent LSGB between 2008 and 2011 was conducted.
8021,876,RESULTS: About 290 biopsies were performed and 74 were excluded due to insufficient clinical data.
8022,876,"Of the 216 patients, 0.46% was carrier of hepatitis C virus, 30.1% had primary SS (pSS), and 8.8% had secondary SS (sSS)."
8023,876,"Of the samples, 94.3% presented dryness symptoms, 51.6% experienced dryness only, 42.7% had systemic manifestations, and 66.9% presented low unstimulated salivary flow and/or Schirmer's test."
8024,876,LSGB was necessary in 67.6% to confirm the presence of SS based on the American-European Consensus Group 2002 criteria (AECG).
8025,876,"Based on specialist's opinion, sensibility level was 86.57%, and specificity was 97.43%."
8026,876,"Positive predictive value (PPV) was 95%, and negative predictive value (NPV) was 92.6%."
8027,876,Determined accuracy was 93.3%.
8028,876,"Concordance (kappa coefficient) of LSGB and specialist's opinion was 0.851, and LSGB with AECG criteria was 0.806."
8029,876,"Of the 98 patients referred with fibromyalgia and dryness, 36.7% had SS and LSBG focus score of  1."
8030,876,"Patients with SS were older, and showed more severe lachrymal and salivary dysfunctions, greater frequency of fibromyalgia, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-SSA-Ro, and anti-SSB-La."
8031,876,"CONCLUSIONS: Labial salivary gland biopsy has high sensibility, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for diagnosis of pSS."
8032,876,"In the clinical practice, it is useful, especially for those patients with glandular dysfunctions and negative antibodies."
8033,877,PURPOSE: To assess the tear film and meibomian gland (MG) features in a Norwegian cohort of patients with primary Sjgrens syndrome (pSS) and in age- and gender-matched control subjects.
8034,877,METHODS: Thirty-four female patients with pSS (age 52.911.9 years) and 32 female control subjects (age 49.011.5 years) were recruited.
8035,877,"After completion of Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and McMonnies Dry Eye Questionaire, participants underwent measurements of tear osmolarity, tear break-up time (TBUT), ocular surface and corneal staining, Schirmer I test, corneal sensitivity, MG expressibility evaluations, and lid margin morphology examination using slitlamp microscopy."
8036,877,Non-contact infrared meibography images were assessed by computer-assisted analysis.
8037,877,"The MG loss, calculated as (tarsal area-MG area)/tarsal area, was evaluated in both upper (UL) and lower lids (LL)."
8038,877,"RESULTS: Compared to the control group, pSS patients demonstrated higher MG loss in both UL (33.813.2% vs. 24.48.5%, p< 0.01) and LL (52.515.7% vs. 43.09.6%, p<0.05), as well as higher lid abnormality score (0.80.8 vs. 0.20.6, p< 0.01)."
8039,877,"Furthermore, pSS patients showed higher OSDI and McMonnies questionnaire scores, elevated osmolarity, shorter TBUT, shorter blink interval, less wetting in Schirmer I test, more ocular surface staining and more corneal staining."
8040,877,"MG loss in UL correlated negatively with TBUT (r = -0.386, p = 0.029) in the pSS group, whereas MG loss in LL correlated negatively with TBUT (r = -0.380, p = 0.035) in the control group."
8041,877,"CONCLUSIONS: Significantly elevated dry eye symptoms and signs were found in the pSS group compared with the control group, which might be attributed to both decreased aqueous tear production and increased tear evaporation."
8042,878,OBJECTIVE: It is not known whether autonomic neuropathy is a feature of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) or whether it is related to circulating antiganglionic acetylcholine receptor (gAChR) antibodies.
8043,878,"The goal of the present study was to investigate the autonomic dysfunction in patients with SS and the associations between autonomic dysfunction, anti-gAChR antibodies, and clinical features of SS."
8044,878,METHODS: (1) The first observational study tested for the presence of gAChR antibodies in the serum samples from 39 patients with SS (absent information regarding autonomic symptoms) and healthy volunteers.
8045,878,"(2) In the second study, serological and clinical data from 10 Japanese patients diagnosed with SS were reviewed."
8046,878,"These patients showed autonomic dysfunction, and luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) test was conducted to detect anti-3 and anti-4 gAChR antibodies."
8047,878,"(3) In the final analysis, we combined the data of seropositive SS patients with autonomic symptom from the first study with all of the patients from the second study, and analyzed the clinical features."
8048,878,"RESULTS: (1) The LIPS assay revealed that anti-gAChR3 and anti-gAChR4 antibodies were detected in the sera from patients with SS (23.1%, 9/39)."
8049,878,Five of nine SS patients had autonomic symptoms.
8050,878,(2) Anti-3 and anti-4 gAChR antibodies were also detected in 80.0% (8/10) of patients with SS with autonomic symptoms.
8051,878,Six of the ten patients were diagnosed as having SS after neurological symptoms developed.
8052,878,These seropositive patients had predominant and severe autonomic symptoms and were diagnosed with autonomic neuropathy.
8053,878,"(3) Thirteen of fifteen SS patients with autonomic symptoms (86.7%) were seropositive for anti-gAChR antibodies, and we confirmed sicca complex, orthostatic hypotension, upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and bladder dysfunction at high rates."
8054,878,CONCLUSION: The present results suggest the possibility of anti-gAChR antibodies aiding the diagnostics of SS with autonomic dysfunction.
8055,879,AIM: Our previous study confirmed the defect of B7-H4 expression in peripheral blood and salivary glands of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
8056,879,The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of the deficit expression of B7-H4 on CD4(+) T cells.
8057,879,METHODS: CD4(+) T cells were purified by magnetic-activated cell sorting MACS.
8058,879,The proliferation and cytokine production of CD4(+) T cells co-cultured with purified salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs) from pSS or non-SS sicca syndrome were detected.
8059,879,"RESULTS: By co-culturing the gland cells with CD4(+) T cells, we found the proliferation of CD4(+) T cells was significantly suppressed."
8060,879,The effect was weaker when SGECs from pSS patients were used compared to that from non-pSS sicca syndrome controls.
8061,879,"Simultaneously, the productions of cytokines interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-6 in supernatant were reduced and also SGECs from pSS patients decreased them less than that from non-SS controls."
8062,879,"CONCLUSIONS: The decrease of B7-H4 expression in salivary glands of SS patients contributes to the defect of negatively regulating the inflammation caused by CD4(+) T cells, thereby providing new insights into the role of B7-H4 in the inflammatory process of salivary glands in SS."
8063,880,BACKGROUND: Neurologic involvement occurs in approximately 25% of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome.
8064,880,Manifestations are diverse and can affect the entire neuroaxis.
8065,880,Central nervous system dysfunction involves the brain as well as the spinal cord and may recur over time.
8066,880,"Due to a variety of presentations, Sjgren's syndrome with neurologic involvement may be difficult to diagnose."
8067,880,METHODS: We report 4 cases of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome who presented with atypical neurologic manifestations.
8068,880,RESULTS: The first case describes a patient with a pseudotumoral lesion.
8069,880,The second patient was a 54-year-old woman suffering from a multiple mononeuropathy.
8070,880,"The third case describes a 66-year-old man whose primary Sjgren's syndrome presented as progressive multiple sclerosis, and the fourth case reports a 57-year-old woman patient suffering from myelitis along with progressive cognitive disorders."
8071,880,CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic impairment in Sjgren's syndrome is probably underestimated and the diagnosis is often delayed.
8072,880,Primary Sjgren's syndrome should be suspected in patients presenting with atypical clinical and radiologic neurologic manifestations.
8073,881,PURPOSE: To analyze the influence of thermal partial punctal occlusion on the ocular surface of dry eye related to Sjgren syndrome.
8074,881,MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-seven eyes of 19 patients (3 male and 16 female; 49.1114.33 years old) with keratoconjunctivitis sicca were enrolled in this study.
8075,881,Superior and inferior partial occlusion were performed in both eyes under topical anesthesia using thermal cautery with a sterile tip to obtain lacrimal punctum smaller than 0.5mm.
8076,881,"Schirmer I, break-up-time, diameter of lacrimal puncta, corneal fluorescein, and rose Bengal staining scores were analyzed before and after 24 weeks and after 24 months of the procedure."
8077,881,All measurements were performed under controlled climate.
8078,881,RESULTS: The average lacrimal punctum diameter before the procedure was 0.650.134mm.
8079,881,All lacrimal puncta were successfully reduced to less than 0.5mm after 4 weeks of the procedure.
8080,881,The average Schirmer I test values improved statistically after 24 weeks and maintained stable after 24 months.
8081,881,"Average break-up-time, rose Bengal, and fluorescein staining score values improved statistically after 24 weeks and improved even more after 24 months."
8082,881,"Average Schirmer I test, break-up-time, rose Bengal, and fluorescein staining scores showed significant improvement (p<0.0001) after 24 months of partial thermal punctal occlusion."
8083,881,"CONCLUSION: Our study showed that reducing the punctum diameter to 0.5mm can improve vital staining scores, break-up-time, and Schirmer I test in dry eye related to Sjgren syndrome."
8084,882,OBJECTIVES: Mikulicz's disease (MD) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related disease with systemic symptoms.
8085,882,"Submandibular gland (SMG) biopsy is recommended for patients with possible IgG4-related MD for accurate differential diagnosis; however, it is difficult for certain patients to undergo this procedure."
8086,882,"In contrast, labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsy is more convenient."
8087,882,Here we present an analysis of patients with IgG4-related MD whose LSG specimens were infiltrated with abundant IgG4-positive plasma cells.
8088,882,METHODS: Sixteen patients diagnosed with IgG4-related MD underwent simultaneous SMG and LSG biopsies.
8089,882,"We evaluated patients' serological and (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) and grouped them as LSG+ (LSG specimens with > 40% IgG4-positive plasma cells/IgG-positive plasma cells, 11 patients) or LSG- (LSG specimens with < 40% IgG4-positive plasma cells/IgG-positive plasma cells, 6 patients)."
8090,882,"RESULTS: There were not significant differences in serum IgG and IgG4 levels between the two groups; however, serum concentrations of soluble interleuikin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) were significantly higher in the LSG+ group."
8091,882,All patients with increased (18)F-FDG uptake in their parotid glands were a part of the LSG+ group.
8092,882,"CONCLUSIONS: When a SMG biopsy is not possible, the serum concentration of sIL-2R and (18)F-FDG-PET/CT findings may predict whether LSG biopsy will facilitate the diagnosis of IgG4-related MD."
8093,883,PURPOSE: In this study we aimed to investigate myocardial function and atrial electromechanical properties by conventional and tissue doppler echocardiography in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome.
8094,883,METHODS: Forty patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS) and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study.
8095,883,"Using transthoracic echocardiography, myocardial performance index and atrial electromechanical properties were measured."
8096,883,RESULTS: Basal characteristics were similar between two groups.
8097,883,"Myocardial performance index values were disturbed in patients with Sjgren syndrome (0.41 vs. 0.32, p < 0.01)."
8098,883,"There was significant intraatrial (16.46.4, 5.04.5, p < 0.01) and interatrial (30.610.1, 15.45.9, p < 0.01) electromechanical delay in this patient group."
8099,883,CONCLUSION: Myocardial function is disturbed and there is significant atrial electromechanical delay in patients with primary SS.
8100,883,This study is the first to show altered myocardial function and atrial electromechanical properties in primary SS.
8101,884,Sjgren syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease that principally affects women between the fourth and sixth decades of life who present with sicca symptomatology caused by dryness of the main mucosal surfaces.
8102,884,The clinical spectrum of Sjgren syndrome extends from dryness to systemic involvement.
8103,884,"Since 1978, Sjgren syndrome has been closely associated with an enhanced risk of lymphoma, one of the most severe complications a patient may develop."
8104,884,"Primary Sjgren syndrome patients have a 10-44-fold greater risk of lymphoma than healthy individuals, higher than that reported for systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis."
8105,884,"The close link between lymphoma and Sjgren syndrome is clearly exemplified by the very specific type of lymphoma arising in Sjgren syndrome patients, mainly low-grade B-cell lymphomas (predominantly a marginal zone histological type) with primary extranodal involvement of the major salivary glands (overwhelmingly parotid), with a primordial role of cryoglobulinemic-related markers (both clinical and immunological)."
8106,884,The most recent studies support a higher number of risk factors detected in an individual leads to a higher lymphoma risk.
8107,884,"A close follow-up of high-risk groups with longitudinal assessments of all known risk factors, including cryoglobulin-related markers and EULAR Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index measurement in particular, is mandatory."
8108,885,"The liver is a lymphoid organ involved in the immune response and in the maintenance of tolerance to self molecules, but it is also a target of autoimmune reactions, as observed in primary liver autoimmune diseases (AILD) such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis."
8109,885,"Further, the liver is frequently involved in connective tissue diseases (CTD), most commonly in the form of liver function test biochemical changes with predominant cholestatic or hepatocellular patterns."
8110,885,"CTD commonly affecting the liver include systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholypid syndrome, primary Sjgren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, polimyositis, and anti-synthetase syndrome, while overlap syndromes between AILD and CTD may also be diagnosed."
8111,885,"Although liver cirrhosis and failure are extremely rare in patients with CTD, unusual liver conditions such as nodular regenerative hyperplasia or Budd-Chiari syndrome have been reported with increasing frequency in patients with CTD."
8112,885,"Acute or progressing liver involvement is generally related to viral hepatitis reactivation or to a concomitant AILD, so it appears to be fundamental to screen patients for HBV and HCV infection, in order to provide the ideal therapeutic regimen and avoid life-threatening reactivations."
8113,885,"Finally, it is important to remember that the main cause of biochemical liver abnormalities in patients with CTD is a drug-induced alteration or coexisting viral hepatitis."
8114,885,The present article will provide a general overview of the liver involvement in CTD to allow rheumatologists to discriminate the most common clinical scenarios.
8115,886,"Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a progressive autoimmune condition mainly affecting the salivary and lacrimal glands with an incidence of primary SS between 1/100 and 1/1,000."
8116,886,"SS implies an alteration in the epithelium and subepithelium innervation, with consequent reduction of corneal sensitivity."
8117,886,It is necessary to have noninvasive quantitative methods to characterize the status of the corneal nerve fibers of the patients in order to choose and follow the best therapy.
8118,886,"Entropy (information dimension) of the nerve corneal fibers distribution observed by confocal microscopy was evaluated in patients with primary SS (n=30, 6 males, 24 females, 21-81 years), diagnosed by biopsy of salivary gland and blood tests and in sex- age-matched healthy subjects (n=12)."
8119,886,"Corneal nerve fiber density, Langerhans cell count, and cell density in the nerve plexus images were also evaluated."
8120,886,In selected patients salivary gland atrophy degree was also evaluated.
8121,886,Nerve corneal distribution observed by confocal microscopy is fractal.
8122,886,Entropy of the corneal nerve distribution statistically distinguishes between SS patients and healthy subjects: patients present a lower value of information dimension of the corneal nerve fibers distribution than healthy individuals (P<0.001).
8123,886,"Percentage of grouped cases classified by entropy according to the subjects (selected patients vs. healthy) showed a 100% sensitivity and 96% specificity, P<0.0001 with a low value of coefficient of variation among the individuals (6-7 times lower than the other morphometric indexes)."
8124,886,"Entropy correlated with the severity of the disease (salivary gland atrophy degree, P<0.01)."
8125,886,"Evaluation of entropy of the corneal nerve distribution observed by a laser confocal microscopy appears to quantitatively and noninvasively characterize an aspect of the SS patients in relation to the recognition of an impairment of their ocular surface, giving us for the first time a method to objectively and precisely characterize the corneal innervation status in the SS patients."
8126,887,Anti-SS-A/Ro antibody (SS-A) and anti-SS-B/La antibody (SS-B) are important serologic markers in the diagnostic criteria for Primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
8127,887,"Although anti-centromere antibody (ACA)-positive SS is frequently experienced, ACA is not included in these criteria."
8128,887,The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical features of ACA-positive SS and discuss the usefulness of ACA in diagnosing SS.
8129,887,"Forty-five patients with SS were divided into the following three groups: SS-A only-positive group (n=17), SS-A and SS-B both-positive group (n=18), and ACA only-positive group (n=10)."
8130,887,"As a control, 54 patients without SS who were negative for antinuclear antibodies were also evaluated."
8131,887,"The following items were compared among groups: Saxon's test, unstimulated whole salivary flow (UWSF), salivary gland scintigraphy (SGS), histopathologic examination of the minor salivary glands, Schirmer's test, and fluorescein staining of the cornea."
8132,887,"In the ACA only-positive group, Saxon's test was 0.210.26g/2min (meanSD) and UWSF was 0.160.25ml/10min (meanSD), showing a significant decrease in salivary secretion (p<0.05; vs. non-SS)."
8133,887,"On SGS, accumulation and disappearance of (99m)TcO (4) (-) were significantly decreased (p<0.05; vs. non-SS)."
8134,887,"Histopathologic examination showed moderate or severe lymphocytic infiltration and tissue destruction in all cases, similar to that in the SS-A- and/or SS-B-positive groups."
8135,887,"Schirmer's test and fluorescein staining were positive in 60% and 80%, respectively."
8136,887,Impaired lacrimal secretion and keratoconjunctivitis sicca were similar to those in SS-A- and/or SS-B-positive groups.
8137,887,These results suggest that ACA is an autoantibody reflecting impairment in the salivary and lacrimal glands and may be a useful serologic marker for SS.
8138,888,"Despite advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis, disease-specific biomarkers have not been included in the classification criteria for Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS)."
8139,888,"Based on a microarray of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS), we aimed to investigate whether soluble sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (siglec)-5 in saliva might be a biomarker for pSS."
8140,888,The concentration of siglec-5 in saliva and sera was determined by ELISA.
8141,888,Clinical parameters related with pSS were obtained from pSS registry and correlation with salivary siglec-5 level was evaluated.
8142,888,Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed to determine cut off value.
8143,888,A separate validation cohort consisted of subjects with suspicious pSS was evaluated to determine the performance.
8144,888,"The level of salivary siglec-5 was significantly higher in pSS patients (n=170) compared with HCs (n=25), non SS sicca patients (n=78) or patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (n=43) (1346.8 [202.8-4280.0] pg/mL, 6.08 [0-134.0] pg/mL, 195 [0-947.5] pg/mL, and 0 [0-238.7] pg/mL, median [interquartile range], P<0.001)."
8145,888,"Salivary siglec-5 level negatively correlated with salivary flow rate (spearman's rho: -0.420, P<0.001), and positively correlated with ocular surface score (rho: 0.331, P<0.001) and serum immunoglobulin G level (rho=0.202, P=0.008)."
8146,888,"In ROC analysis, area under the curve was 0.774[0.724-0.826]."
8147,888,"With a cut off value of 400pg/mL, sensitivity and specificity was 0.69 and 0.70 respectively."
8148,888,"In validation cohort (45pSS patients and 45 non SS sicca patients), sensitivity and specificity of siglec-5 was 64.4% and 77.8%, respectively."
8149,888,"In conclusion, the level of soluble siglec-5 is significantly higher in the saliva from pSS patients, which reflects the severity of hyposalivation and ocular surface damage."
8150,888,This novel salivary biomarker may provide benefits for pSS diagnosis.
8151,889,The objective was to evaluate renal involvement in several rheumatic diseases (i.e.
8152,889,"rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjgren syndrome, systemic sclerosis, systemic vasculitides)."
8153,889,The method chosen was to define histopathological profiles reported in renal biopsies performed on patients with renal involvement due to different rheumatic diseases.
8154,889,Renal involvement observed in patients with rheumatic disease can be the direct result of the disease per se and/or a complication of drugs used in the disease treatment.
8155,889,"The clinical-pathological correlations derived from the study of renal tissues can be useful for differential diagnosis, prognosis assessment and therapeutic decisions."
8156,889,Renal biopsy should be considered as an important tool for the management of nephropathies in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases.
8157,890,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a complex autoimmune disease with distinct clinical phenotypes and variable outcomes.
8158,890,The systemic form of the disease is characterized by immune complex mediated manifestations and is complicated by lymphoma as a result of a polyclonal B cell hyperactivity that is evolving into B cell malignancy.
8159,890,"In the past decades, well-established clinical and serological markers have been described in the literature to identify high-risk patients and to predict lymphoma development."
8160,890,"However, specific biologic treatments have proven ineffective to control the disease."
8161,890,"Significant research effort has been made to reveal the major underlying biological events in this subgroup and identify biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis and response to treatment."
8162,890,"In this review, we summarize the current data for the proposed histological, molecular and genetic biomarkers."
8163,891,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether B-cell markers (blood and minor salivary gland [SG] B-cell depletion [BCD], autoantibodies, B-cell-activating factor [BAFF]) are associated with clinical response to rituximab in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
8164,891,"METHODS: 45 patients with pSS were included: in group I, 14 received low-dose rituximab (two 375-mg/m(2) infusions) in an open-labelled study; in group II, 17 received full-dose rituximab (two 1000-mg infusions) and 14 received a placebo in a randomized, controlled study."
8165,891,The proportion of SG B cells was assessed using pixel-based software analyses of digitized double-immunostained (CD3/CD20) whole SGs.
8166,891,Response was defined at week-24 according to the Sjgren's Syndrome Responder Index (SSRI)-30.
8167,891,RESULTS: Response rate was 50% in both groups of rituximab-treated patients.
8168,891,"Duration of blood BCD was similar in both groups despite the difference in rituximab dosage, and was highly correlated with residual serum-rituximab levels at week-16."
8169,891,"SG B-cell dynamics mirrored blood B-cell levels, with a drastic decrease in SG B-cells at week-12 (group I), but an increase in  50% of patients in group II by week-24, in whom blood B cells had already returned."
8170,891,"Duration of BCD was not associated with the clinical response, but responders had lower baseline proportions of SG B cells."
8171,891,"Baseline serum BAFF level was correlated with the proportion of SG B-cells and other B-cell-activation markers, and was associated with the clinical response with higher levels in non-responders."
8172,891,"CONCLUSIONS: In pSS, half of the patients display an intense BAFF-driven B-cell activation and do not respond to a single course of rituximab."
8173,892,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this report is to investigate the prognostic value of minor salivary glands (MSG) assessment, routinely performed with hematoxilin-eosin (H&E) staining, for the diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
8174,892,"METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated clinical, serological and histological features of 794 pSS patients."
8175,892,H&E-stained sections were assessed using the Chisholm and Mason grading system and/or the focus score (FS).
8176,892,"RESULTS: FS allowed the identification of a number of differences in the disease spectrum, and its prognostic role was further confirmed by quantifying the association between FS value and clinical/serological variables with binary logistic regression."
8177,892,"Moreover, hypocomplementemia and FS resulted the only variables associated with lymphoma at univariate analysis, and FS appeared to be associated with lymphoma independently on complement fraction concentrations."
8178,892,"Conversely, when patients were divided according to the Chisholm and Mason grading system, we failed to observe any significant difference between subgroups."
8179,892,"CONCLUSION: In addition to its diagnostic role, our data seem to support that the routine assessment of MSG-FS with H&E staining is useful to predict at the time of diagnosis the adverse outcomes, such as lymphoma and extraglandular manifestations, that complicate the pSS course."
8180,892,"On this basis, it should be recommended that an MSG biopsy be performed even in those patients displaying clinical and serological criteria, allowing the diagnosis of pSS independent of histological status."
8181,893,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease, characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the secretory glands."
8182,893,"This process leads to sicca syndrome, which is the combination of dryness of the eyes, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and/or vagina."
8183,893,"Extraglandular manifestations may also be prevalent in patients with pSS, including cutaneous, musculoskeletal, pulmonary, renal, hematological and neurological involvement."
8184,893,"The pathogenesis of pSS is currently not well understood, but increased activation of B cells followed by immune complex formation and autoantibody production are thought to play important roles."
8185,893,pSS is diagnosed using the American-European consensus group (AECG) classification criteria which include subjective symptoms and objective tests such as histopathology and serology.
8186,893,"The treatment of pSS warrants an organ based approach, for which local treatment (teardrops, moistures) and systemic therapy (including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS) and biologicals) can be considered."
8187,893,Biologicals used in the treatment of pSS mainly affect the total numbers of B cells (B cell depletion (Rituximab)) or target proteins required for B cell proliferation and/or activation (e.g.
8188,893,B cell activating factor (BAFF)) resulting in decreased B cell activity.
8189,893,"The aim of this review is to provide physicians a general overview concerning the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of pSS patients."
8190,894,"OBJECTIVES: Fibromyalgia (FM) has been associated with affective spectrum disorders and other chronic pain disorders, which tend to co-occur in individuals and co-aggregate among families."
8191,894,The objective of our study was to investigate the genetic risk factors associated with the presence of related symptoms and with disease severity in subjects affected with FM.
8192,894,METHODS: Two independent cohorts of subjects diagnosed with FM according to the 1990 ACR criteria were studied.
8193,894,"A genetic array composed of 320 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was analysed in a discovery cohort comprised by 564 patients, and the most suggestive variants were genotyped in a replication cohort, comprised by 397 subjects."
8194,894,"The associated conditions and related symptoms analysed were: the presence of depression, sleep disorders, headache, myofascial syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, vertiginous syndrome, chronic cystitis, and sicca syndrome."
8195,894,FM severity was assessed by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
8196,894,"Analyses were adjusted by elapsed time from pain onset, and a meta-analysis was performed to pool the results."
8197,894,"RESULTS: Minor allele of the rs3771863 SNP from the TACR1 gene showed a significant association with a lower risk of sicca syndrome (pooled and adjusted OR 0.56, [95%CI 0.42-0.76], p=0.00022)."
8198,894,CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a role of the TACR1 gene in the development of sicca syndrome in subjects affected with FM.
8199,895,INTRODUCTION: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) often causes lymphoproliferative disorders such as malignant lymphoma and macroglobrinemia.
8200,895,Approximately 5% of long-term follow-up SS patients develop malignant lymphoma.
8201,895,"Recently, the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily cluster of differentiation 30 (CD30) has been thought to be implicated in malignant cells in organs affected by Hodgikin lymphoma or in a prognostic marker of diffuse large B cell lymphoma."
8202,895,"In this study, we investigated CD30 expression in lacrimal gland and conjunctiva in patients with SS."
8203,895,METHODS: We examined lacrimal gland and conjunctival tissues for the diagnosis from 3 female SS patients with a median age of 51 and 3 female chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) patients with a median age of 41.
8204,895,Histological analysis of these tissues of the remaining samples was conducted by methods including immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy (#20090277).
8205,895,"We analyzed the expression and localization of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20), CD30, and Interferon- in tissue sections prepared from lacrimal glands and conjunctiva in 3 each of SS and cGVHD patients."
8206,895,RESULTS: There were more B cells and plasma cells in lobules of SS-affected lacrimal glands than in those of their cGVHD-affected counterparts.
8207,895,Interferon- was expressed on endothelia of capillaries in SS-affected lacrimal gland and conjunctival tissues whereas it was expressed on fibroblasts in their GVHD-affected equivalents.
8208,895,"Furthermore, lacrimal glands and conjunctiva disordered by SS had a greater number of CD30 cells than those disordered by cGVHD."
8209,895,CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CD30 cells are increased in lacrimal glands and conjunctiva affected by SS and that a subset of SS patients are thereby at risk of development malignant lymphoma.
8210,896,PURPOSE: To explore the role of salivary fat fraction (FF) values in evaluating patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
8211,896,"MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 28 patients with pSS, ten patients with suspected pSS, and 28 volunteers were enrolled."
8212,896,The FF values of the parotid and submandibular glands were generated from mDIXON Quant.
8213,896,A one-way analysis of variance was used to compare the FF values among the groups.
8214,896,A receiver-operating characteristic analysis was applied to assess the diagnostic performance of the parotid and submandibular FF values in distinguishing patients with pSS from non-pSS subjects.
8215,896,"In particular, we focused on distinguishing patients with grade 0 pSS from those with suspected pSS."
8216,896,RESULTS: The parotid and submandibular mean FF value of patients with pSS was significantly higher than that of healthy volunteers.
8217,896,The submandibular mean FF value of patients with pSS was higher than those suspected ones.
8218,896,"Submandibular FF value performed better than parotid FF value in differentiating patients with pSS from those non-pSS subjects (area under the curve [AUC]=0.927 vs. 0.734), patients with pSS from patients with suspected pSS (AUC=0.907 vs. 0.725)."
8219,896,This value also performed better at distinguishing patients with grade 0 pSS from those patients with suspected pSS (AUC=0.925 vs. 0.783).
8220,896,"CONCLUSIONS: The salivary gland FF value, especially the submandibular gland FF value, distinguished patients with pSS from those patients with suspected pSS and healthy volunteers."
8221,897,"Sjogren syndrome (SS) is a lymphocyte-mediated, infiltrative autoimmune disorder characterized by destruction of exocrine glands leading to secretory dysfunction."
8222,897,"The typical manifestations include xerostomia and xerophthalmia; however, extensive gastrointestinal involvement is increasingly being recognized, emphasizing the variable and systemic nature of SS."
8223,898,OBJECTIVE: To investigate gut dysbiosis in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) or dry eye syndrome (DES) compared to normal subjects and to evaluate the association of dysbiosis with dry eye severity.
8224,898,"METHODS: 10 subjects with SS, 14 subjects with DES and 12 controls were enrolled."
8225,898,"Corneal staining, tear break up time (TBUT) and tear secretion were evaluated."
8226,898,Bacterial genomic 16s rRNA from stool samples were analyzed.
8227,898,Main outcomes were microbiome compositional differences among groups and their correlation to dry eye signs.
8228,898,RESULTS: Gut microbiome analysis revealed significant compositional differences in SS compared to controls and DES.
8229,898,"In phylum, Bacteriodetes increased, while Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and Actinobacteria decreased (p<0.05)."
8230,898,"In genus, Bifidobacterium was reduced (vs controls; p = 0.025, vs DES; p = 0.026)."
8231,898,"Beta diversity of SS also showed significant distances from controls and DES (p = 0.007 and 0.019, respectively)."
8232,898,"SS showed decreased genus of Blautia (p = 0.041), Dorea (p = 0.025) and Agathobacter (p = 0.035) compared to controls and increased genus of Prevotella (p = 0.026), Odoribacter (p = 0.028) and Alistipes (p = 0.46) compared to DES."
8233,898,"On the other hand, DES only had increased genus Veillonella (p = 0.045) and reduced Subdoligranulum (p = 0.035) compared to controls."
8234,898,"Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Bifidobacterium were significantly related with dry eye signs (p<0.05)."
8235,898,"After adjustment of age, gender and group classification, multivariate linear regression analysis revealed tear secretion was strongly affected by Prevotella (p = 0.025)."
8236,898,"With additional adjustment of hydroxychloroquine use, TBUT was markedly affected by Prevotella (p = 0.037) and Actinobacteria (p = 0.001)."
8237,898,"CONCLUSIONS: Sjgren's syndrome showed significant gut dysbiosis compared to controls and environmental dry eye syndrome, while dry eye patients showed compositional changes of gut microbiome somewhere in between Sjgren's syndrome and controls."
8238,898,Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota was partly correlated to dry eye severity.
8239,899,BACKGROUND: Typical features of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) are severe xerostomia and xerophthalmia which are basic diagnostic criteria.
8240,899,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the serum levels of soluble (s) intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1) and sE-selectin between primary (pSS), secondary (sSS) and healthy subjects (HS)."
8241,899,We correlated these results with selected clinical parameters of disease activity and parameters of the severity of xerostomia and xerophthalmia.
8242,899,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: The serum levels of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 16 patients with pSS, 18 with sSS and 15 HS."
8243,899,"Eye dryness and xerostomia were assessed by the Schirmer's test, the Fox test and the visual analogue scale (VAS)."
8244,899,"RESULTS: The levels of sICAM-1 in pSS and sVCAM-1 in sSS patients were significantly higher when compared to HS (p = 0.02 and p = 0.048, respectively)."
8245,899,There were no differences between pSS and sSS.
8246,899,"In pSS, sVCAM-1 correlated positively with VAS (rS = 0.52, p = 0.04) and the Fox test (rS = 0.66, p=0.01)."
8247,899,"In sSS, sE-selectin correlated positively with sICAM-1 (rS = 0.54, p = 0.01), the duration of the disease (rS = 0.51, p = 0.03) and negatively with the Schirmer's test (rS = 0.59, p = 0.04)."
8248,899,"sICAM-1 correlated positively with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) value (rS = 0.59, p = 0.01)."
8249,899,CONCLUSIONS: sVCAM-1 reflects xerostomia in pSS.
8250,899,sICAM-1 and sE-selectin may be additional parameters of sSS activity.
8251,900,PURPOSE: Sjgren syndrome (SS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease of the lacrimal and salivary glands.
8252,900,"This study compared the concentrations of epidermal fatty-acid binding protein (E-FABP) in the saliva, serum, and tears of SS patients with dry eye and dry mouth, with those of healthy adults to investigate the usefulness of E-FABP as a diagnostic marker for SS."
8253,900,"DESIGN: Prospective, observational case series."
8254,900,PARTICIPANTS: The subjects were 11 new patients with untreated Sjogren syndrome and 12 healthy control individuals.
8255,900,"METHODS: The diagnosis of SS was in accordance with the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan) Diagnostic Criteria (1999)."
8256,900,"Saliva, serum, and tear specimens were collected during internal medicine, dental, and ophthalmological examinations."
8257,900,"The ophthalmological tests included the Dry Eye-related Quality of life Score (DEQS), tear break-up time (BUT), vital staining with fluorescein (FS) and lissamine green (LG), and the Schirmer test-1."
8258,900,"The E-FABP concentration in the tears, saliva, and serum was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)."
8259,900,MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The E-FABP concentrations were compared between patients and controls.
8260,900,RESULTS: There were significant differences between the patient and healthy control groups in all ophthalmological test results.
8261,900,"There were no significant differences between the groups in the E-FABP concentrations in the saliva (p = 0.1513) or the serum (p = 0.4799), but the E-FABP concentration in the tears significantly differed between groups."
8262,900,"The E-FABP concentration in tears tended to be significantly lower in patients with SS (mean, 323.5  325.6 pg/mL) than healthy control subjects (mean, 4076 pg/mL; p = 0.0136)."
8263,900,The E-FABP concentration in tears significantly correlated with the results of dry eye parameters.
8264,900,CONCLUSION: The E-FABP concentration in tears appears to be related to ocular surface epithelial damage and tear stability and may be a promising novel biomarker in the diagnosis of SS.
8265,901,"Primary Sjgren's (pSS) syndrome is a chronic, autoimmune, and systemic disease characterized by xerostomia, xerophthalmia, muscle pain and fatigue."
8266,901,"The disease may be complicated by a systemic involvement, such as a pulmonary fibrosis or the development of lymphoma which severely worsens the prognosis."
8267,901,"Actually, there are no recommendations for the management of pSS."
8268,901,"However, recent advances in the understanding of its pathogenesis have uncovered some pathways that have potential as therapeutic targets."
8269,901,"Areas covered: In this review, the authors present the biologic drugs potentially valuable to the treatment of pSS in light of its physiopathology with a 'bird's eye' view of future prospects."
8270,901,The authors took into account relevant studies published from 2004 to 2016.
8271,901,Expert opinion: Biological treatment in pSS is a promising opportunity to potentially control disease activity and prevent its complication.
8272,901,"Currently, inhibition of B-cell and IL-17 pathways seem to be the most promising avenues."
8273,901,"New achievements in the knowledge of pSS pathophysiology are necessary in order to try to simultaneously predict the predominant pathogenic pathway, the kind of patients at major risk to develop a more severe disease, and the appropriate biological therapy to use."
8274,902,OBJECTIVES: To assess the use and causes of withdrawal of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressors among patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) in the clinical setting.
8275,902,"METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 155 pSS patients and registered demographics, glandular/extraglandular features, serological data, cumulative ESSDAI and SSDDI."
8276,902,A single rheumatologist attributed the indication and cause of withdrawal of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressors.
8277,902,"RESULTS: 92.2% of the patients were female, mean age 57.414.7 years and median follow-up 11 years."
8278,902,"One hundred and four (67%) patients received glucocorticoids and/or immunosuppressors: 3.8% only glucocorticoids, 43.9% only immunosuppressors and 56.5% their combination."
8279,902,"The most used drugs were antimalarials (46.4%), prednisone (36.7%), azathioprine (AZA) (23.8%) and methotrexate (MTX) (18%)."
8280,902,"At the multivariate analysis, the presence of non-erosive arthritis OR 5.02 (95% CI 1.74-14.47, p=0.003) and the median cumulative ESSDAI score OR 1.10 (95% CI 1.03-1.17, p=0.002) were associated with the use of these drugs."
8281,902,"The causes of withdrawal were: 39% improvement, 35.2% patient's own decision, 18.1% toxicity and 11% lack of efficacy."
8282,902,"We found toxicity in 14.2% MTX users, 9.7% for AZA, 9.7% for antimalarials and 7.6% for cyclophosphamide."
8283,902,"CONCLUSIONS: More than half the patients received glucocorticoids and/or immunosuppressors and a not negligible number decided on their own to suspend them, alerting physicians of secondary adverse events and tolerability."
8284,903,For the first time vital morphological structure of lacrimal gland was investigated based on spatial ultrasound digital examination.
8285,903,Structural characteristics of lacrimal gland are described considering anatomic topography and blood supply.
8286,903,These characteristics are analyzed based on planar and volumetric sonography depending on the patient age and pattern of changes.
8287,903,Their correlation is studied.
8288,903,"The results of lacrimal gland examination allowed us to analyze a number of ultrasound diagnostic signs and compare them with changes in acute dacryoadenitis, MALT-lymphoma, Sjogren disease, sarcoidosis and thyroid eye disease."
8289,903,Revealed features may be useful for understanding of nature of clinical presentation.
8290,903,The results of the study may help to interpret diagnostic signs and follow up their evolution in a clinical course of a disease.
8291,904,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the infiltration of lymphocytes into exocrine glands, resulting in the typical sicca symptoms."
8292,904,"Unlike adults, primary SS is a very rare condition in childhood, and the risk of malignancy in juvenile SS (JSS) has not been defined."
8293,904,We report the detection of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (EMZL) occurring in two children with SS.
8294,904,Fine needle aspiration of the salivary glands (SG) showed nonspecific findings that led to delayed diagnosis of SS.
8295,904,The diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma associated with JSS was based on morphologic and immunohistochemical staining done during the biopsy.
8296,904,To highlight awareness of EMZL as a timely and appropriate update of an unusual complication in children with SS.
8297,905,"BACKGROUND: To investigated distinct manifestations of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) patients with neurological complications and the potential risk factors associated with neurological complications in SS, and to produce a disease evaluation and neurological involvement prediction for SS."
8298,905,METHODS: 566 patients who fulfilled the 2002 classification criteria for SS from the Rheumatology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University were included in the cross-sectional study.
8299,905,"Clinical, immunological and histological characteristics were surveyed, and potential risk factors for neurological complications were examined by multivariate analysis."
8300,905,"RESULTS: Among 566 SS patients, 184 (32.5%) patients had neurological involvement, with more than 10% got limbs pain, limbs numbness and cerebral infarction, respectively."
8301,905,"Of these 184 SS patients with neurological complications, secondary SS (sSS) patients had a higher prevalence of peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement than primary SS (pSS) patients (31.1 vs. 19%)."
8302,905,"And sSS patients showed higher total ESSPRI score and higher prevalence of xerostomia and low C3, C4 levels with more liver, articular involvement and saliva gland atrophy, and more severe lymphocyte infiltration in salivary glands than pSS patients."
8303,905,"As for the specific factors associated with neurological involvement, low C3 level were found to be significant in pSS or sSS patients who were younger 50year old, and ANA positivity, cardiac involvement, saliva gland atrophy were demonstrated to be associated in elder pSS patients."
8304,905,And xerophthalmia was found to be associated in sSS patients.
8305,905,"CONCLUSION: Low complement (C3) levels, xerophthalmia, ANA positive, cardiac involvement and labial salivary gland histological result were good ways to predict neurological complications in different subgroups of SS, which might provide insight into better clinical decision-making, especially at early stages of the disease."
8306,906,We present the sonographic features of a second-trimester fetus diagnosed with a bradyarrhythmia at 19 weeks' gestation.
8307,906,"The mother carried a diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome, including the presence of SSA and SSB antibodies."
8308,906,"Ultrasound M-mode and fetal echocardiogram revealed the etiology of the bradycardia to be a complete fetal congenital heart block, likely due to transplacental passage of autoimmune anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies."
8309,906,"Consequential to the congenital heart block, the fetus developed hydrops fetalis at 21 weeks' gestational age."
8310,906,We discuss the 2 major etiologies of congenital heart block and the implications in subsequent pregnancies.
8311,907,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of rituximab versus placebo on salivary gland ultrasound (SGUS) in primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS) in a multicentre, multiobserver phase III trial substudy."
8312,907,"METHODS: Subjects consenting to SGUS were randomised to rituximab or placebo given at weeks 0, 2, 24 and 26, and scanned at baseline and weeks 16 and 48."
8313,907,"Sonographers completed a 0-11 total ultrasound score (TUS) comprising domains of echogenicity, homogeneity, glandular definition, glands involved and hypoechoic foci size."
8314,907,"Baseline-adjusted TUS values were analysed over time, modelling change from baseline at each time point."
8315,907,"For each TUS domain, we fitted a repeated-measures logistic regression model to model the odds of a response in the rituximab arm (1-point improvement) as a function of the baseline score, age category, disease duration and time point."
8316,907,RESULTS: 52 patients (n=26rituximab and n=26placebo) from nine centres completed baseline and one or more follow-up visits.
8317,907,Estimated between-group differences (rituximab-placebo) in baseline-adjusted TUS were -1.2 (95% CI -2.1 to -0.3; P=0.0099) and -1.2 (95% CI -2.0 to -0.5; P=0.0023) at weeks 16 and 48.
8318,907,Glandular definition improved in the rituximab arm with an OR of 6.8 (95% CI 1.1 to 43.0; P=0.043) at week 16 and 10.3 (95% CI 1.0 to 105.9; P=0.050) at week 48.
8319,907,CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated statistically significant improvement in TUS after rituximab compared with placebo.
8320,907,This encourages further research into both B cell depletion therapies in PSS and SGUS as an imaging biomarker.
8321,907,"TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 65360827, 2010-021430-64; Results."
8322,908,"Although the inherent complexity of the multifactorial nature of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) renders the process of disease prognostication and prediction ambiguous, certain clinical and immunological characteristics have been described as lymphoma predictors in several studies."
8323,908,"While the association between pSS and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas is indisputable, recent studies report a predominance of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas implying that pSS-lymphoma association is less subtype-specific than previously considered."
8324,908,The considerable differences in both disease severity and prognosis between patients with various types of lymphoma demand the identification of risk factors that can predict the development of the distinct subtypes.
8325,908,"Additionally, a recently discovered diverse range of biological variables appears to influence clinical behavior and lymphoma outcome."
8326,908,"In this review, we venture into the area of lymphoma prognostication in pSS, outlining long-established predictors, analyzing currently available prognostic models, and exploring the predictive potential of recent biological and molecular advances."
8327,909,"Although tendon pain is commonly reported in primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS), the underlying mechanism is unknown."
8328,909,The objective of this study was to determine whether tendon pain in pSS is related to involvement of the tendons and entheses.
8329,909,We performed a physical examination of 288 entheseal insertion sites in 16 patients with active pSS and 162 entheseal insertion sites in 9 healthy controls without symptoms or medications.
8330,909,Then ultrasound was used to assess entheseal and tendon sites of these patients (n = 208) and controls (n = 117).
8331,909,"Ultrasound was performed in B mode first to detect structural damages, and in power Doppler mode to detect blood flow abnormalities."
8332,909,"By physical examination, 9 (56%) of the 16 pSS patients had pain to palpation of fibromyalgia tender points, two of whom had more than 11 tender points."
8333,909,"The number of positive points ranged from 2 to 18, with a mean of 8  6.0."
8334,909,None of the healthy controls had positive tender points.
8335,909,None had structural or blood-flow abnormalities by ultrasound.
8336,909,"To conclude, this study provides the first data on ultrasound findings in patients with active pSS."
8337,909,"Although 56% of patients had clinical tender points, none had structural or blood-flow abnormalities by ultrasound, suggesting the absence of inflammation of the tendons and entheses in this disease."
8338,910,The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of quantifying salivary gland scintigraphy in correlation to the labial biopsy findings of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
8339,910,Thirty patients suspected of having SS referred to our clinic for salivary gland scintigraphy were included to this study.
8340,910,All patients underwent salivary gland biopsy as well.
8341,910,The severity of histopathologic changes was graded according to the Chisholm and Mason scoring system.
8342,910,Dynamic scintigraphy was performed and region of interests (ROI) were drawn.
8343,910,Time activity curves for salivary glands were generated.
8344,910,"Count rates of maximum, minimum activity after lemon juice stimuli, and last minute activities of parotid and submandibular glands were obtained."
8345,910,"On the basis of this ROI counts, excretion fraction (EF%) was calculated for all salivary glands."
8346,910,"The mean EF% for normal parotid gland and pathologic parotid gland was 54.513.9 and 45.818.42, respectively, while it was 46.711.7 for the normal submandibular gland and 29.318.8 for the pathologic submandibular gland."
8347,910,"With progression in histopathologic grades from 0 to 4, the EF decreased in all salivary glands."
8348,910,"Decreased EF in the salivary glands is correlated with the SS, and salivary gland scintigraphy is a sensitive and valid method for evaluation of the function of the salivary glands."
8349,911,AIMS: (i) To analyze the in vivo corneal structure and sub-basal plexus nerves in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and no-SS dry eye by confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) and (ii) to correlate CSLM findings with tear function tests and with patients' subjective dryness.
8350,911,"METHODS: Seventeen patients with pSS, 16 no-SS dry eye, and 20 healthy volunteers were included."
8351,911,"CSLM parameters taken into consideration included: basal epithelial integrity, corneal thickness, epithelial cellular density, keratocyte activation, and sub-basal plexus morphology."
8352,911,"Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS-13 (Chicago IL, USA)."
8353,911,RESULTS: CSLM pachymetric data and the superficial epithelium cell density were significantly lower in pSS versus no-SS dry eye (p < 0.0001); keratocyte activation and sub-basal nerve abnormalities were also more frequent in pSS patients (p < 0.0001).
8354,911,CSLM findings well correlated with both the ocular test results and the patients' perception of ocular dryness at the baseline and over the follow-up.
8355,911,CONCLUSION: CSLM might be a useful novel tool in the assessment of the involvement of the lachrymal functional unit in pSS.
8356,912,Our aim was to evaluate fatigue and quality of life (QoL) in Moroccan patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS) and determine their correlates with disease-related parameters.
8357,912,Fifty-seven consecutive patients with PSS according to the American-European Consensus group (AEGG) criteria were included.
8358,912,"Demographic, clinical, biological and immunological characteristics for all patients were collected."
8359,912,Xerostomia was demonstrated by histological grading of lower lip glandular biopsy.
8360,912,A Schirmer test was performed to measure lachrymal flow.
8361,912,"Oral, ocular, skin, vaginal and tracheal dryness were evaluated by using a visual analogue scale (VAS)."
8362,912,Fatigue was assessed by the Multidimensional assessment of fatigue (MAF) and the QoL by using the generic instrument: SF-36.
8363,912,90% of our patients were women.
8364,912,"The mean age of patients was 53.73  7.69 years, and the mean disease duration was 5.38  4.11 years."
8365,912,"The mean oral dryness was 68.38  20.29, and the mean ocular dryness was 51.91  14.03."
8366,912,"The mean total score of the MAF was 26.73  8.33, and 87.5% of our patients experienced severe fatigue."
8367,912,"Also, physical and mental domains of QoL were altered in a significant way, and the severity of fatigue had a negative impact on SF-36 scores."
8368,912,"MAF and SF-36 scores were correlated with the delay of diagnosis, the intensity of xerostomia and the activity of joint involvement."
8369,912,A low socioeconomic and educational level had a negative impact on fatigue scores and QoL.
8370,912,"Histological grading of lower lip glandular biopsy, immunological status and the severity of systemic involvement had no correlations with fatigue scores or the alteration of QoL."
8371,912,Patients receiving antidepressant have lesser fatigue and those receiving Methotrexate have better SF-36 scores.
8372,912,"In our data, there was a high prevalence of fatigue in Moroccan patients with PSS associated with altered QoL."
8373,912,"Severe fatigue and reduced QoL seem to be related to the severity of joint involvement, xerostomia and both educational and socioeconomic levels."
8374,912,"Also, treatment with methotrexate and antidepressant seems to improve patients' living and QoL."
8375,912,An appropriate therapeutic intervention for depression and articular manifestations in PSS should be applied to improve patients' living.
8376,913,We report a case of interstitial cystitis (IC) associated with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) successfully controlled with combination therapy of tacrolimus and a corticosteroid.
8377,913,"In 2011, a 69-year-old female, who had been diagnosed with primary SS 23 years ago, developed IC and was successfully treated with tacrolimus and prednisolone combination therapy."
8378,913,"The mechanism of IC, including the involved autoimmunity, has not been elucidated."
8379,913,Clinical observation studies suggest a potential association between SS and IC.
8380,913,"However, IC is currently thought to be underdiagnosed in patients with SS as well as in the general population."
8381,913,"Based on our case and others reported previously, IC associated with SS responds well to immunosuppressive therapy."
8382,913,"In particular, a combination of a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) with a corticosteroid seems to be highly effective."
8383,913,The possibility of IC in patients with SS complaining of lower urinary tract symptoms without features of infection or other identifiable causes should be given attention.
8384,914,PURPOSE: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a common autoimmune disease affecting about four million Americans.
8385,914,"Although approximately 1 in 10 patients with clinically-significant aqueous deficient dry eye has underlying SS, widespread underappreciation of SS leads to significant underdiagnosis, delays in diagnosis, and consequent morbidity and mortality."
8386,914,"The purpose of this article is to illustrate that in addition to dry eye, SS can cause serious, vision-threatening extraglandular ocular manifestations."
8387,914,METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of studies that have examined the dry eye and extraglandular ocular complications of SS.
8388,914,"RESULTS: SS-related dry eye is a progressive condition with major negative impact on the quality-of-life of afflicted patients, not only due to symptoms of ocular discomfort but also visual dysfunction."
8389,914,"In addition, SS can lead to corneal melt/perforation, uveitis, scleritis, retinal vasculitis, and optic neuritis."
8390,914,A major problem with currently-available SS disease activity measurement instruments is the lack of domains evaluating dry eye-related visual dysfunction.
8391,914,"For example, one of the most commonly-used instruments for assessing patient symptoms in SS (the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index [ESSPRI]) only includes one item (out of three) that addresses the severity of overall dryness, without mention of dry eye symptoms or vision-related quality-of-life."
8392,914,"Similarly, no extraglandular ocular complications are included in currently-available SS disease activity instruments (e.g., the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index [ESSDAI])."
8393,914,CONCLUSIONS: There needs to be a paradigm shift in which eye care providers and rheumatologists become more familiar with various SS-related extraglandular ocular manifestations.
8394,914,"Existing disease activity measurement instruments must incorporate dry eye symptoms, particularly those related to visual dysfunction."
8395,914,An evidence-based screening algorithm for determining which patients with dry eye should be tested for underlying SS may be particularly helpful in preventing delays in diagnosis.
8396,915,"BACKGROUND: Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection in immunocompromized patients is currently a growing health concern, and we aimed to examine the relative risk of NTM infection in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) compared with that in non-SS individuals."
8397,915,"METHODS: We used the 2003-2012 Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database to identify 6554 incident SS cases during 2007-2012 and selected 98,310 non-SS controls matched (1:15) for age, gender, and the year of first SS diagnosis date after excluding those who had rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus."
8398,915,RESULTS: We identified four NTM-infected patients in the SS group (three in the first year) and nine in the non-SS group (three in the first year).
8399,915,"SS patients had a higher incidence rate of NTM infection than that in non-SS individuals (IRR, 7.56; 95% CI, 2.33-24.55), especially during the first year (IRR, 16.05; 95% CI, 3.24-79.51)."
8400,915,"After adjusting for potential confounders, the risk of NTM infection was not increased in SS patients during the entire follow-up period or during the first year, but the risk increased in SS patients treated with immunosuppressants during the entire follow-up period (HR, 17.77; 95% CI, 4.53-69.61), especially during the first year (HR, 33.33; 95% CI, 4.37-254.23)."
8401,915,CONCLUSION: An increased risk of NTM infection was found in SS patients treated with immunosuppressants during the first year after SS diagnosis.
8402,916,Primary Sjgren syndrome (PSS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by sicca complex and various systemic manifestations.
8403,916,"Although it is well accepted to use corticosteroids for the treatment of systemic manifestations, there is scarce information available regarding the use of targeted therapy for refractory cases."
8404,916,"We describe a case of a severe PSS patient refractory to conventional treatment with a response to bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor commonly used for the treatment of multiple myeloma."
8405,916,"Bortezomib administration resulted in a notable improvement of the general symptoms, particularly fatigue, and a decrease in serum globulin levels as well as in serum viscosity."
8406,916,"Hyperglobulinemic purpura disappeared, and prednisone tapering succeeded."
8407,916,"Because of chronicity, no clinical changes were observed in sicca symptoms."
8408,916,"As far as we know, this is the first report on the use of bortezomib in a refractory case of PSS."
8409,917,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the Raman spectral characteristics of the pathological lip minor salivary glands affected in primary Sjgren's syndrome.
8410,917,METHODS: Thirty pathological samples and 30 normal samples were collected in this study.
8411,917,The samples were examined by Raman microscope.Support vector machine(SVM) was employed to analyze the data and establish the classification model.
8412,917,"RESULTS: The spectra of pathological tissues was different from the controls in proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and glycogen skeleton."
8413,917,"The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the model established by SVM on the training sets were all 92.0% (92/100), but the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the model established by SVM on the testing sets were 69.2% (37/53), 100.0% (37/37) and 82.0% (73/89) respectively."
8414,917,"CONCLUSIONS: There was significant difference in Raman spectra between the pathological and normal lip salivary glands, and the classification model established by SVM could discriminate the pathological glands from the normal ones."
8415,918,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical and audiological behaviour per age group in Sjgren's Syndrome (SS), considering that it is the second most frequent autoimmune rheumatic disease."
8416,918,MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study included 29 patients with SS with clinical history and audiological studies.
8417,918,"The design was prospective, descriptive and transversal."
8418,918,RESULTS: Average patient age was 41 years.
8419,918,All the patients with hearing loss in conventional tone audiometry were of the sensory type.
8420,918,"At high frequencies, 66% of the patients did not respond at 20 KHz, and 48% at the frequency of 16 KHz."
8421,918,"In logoaudiometry and impedancemetry, the results were the ones expected for the auditory thresholds."
8422,918,CONCLUSIONS: Auditory damage related to SS is located in the inner ear.
8423,918,Patients must be informed by their physician of the risk of having auditory damage as a complication of the disease.
8424,918,Audiological evaluation must be performed periodically to identify possible audiological damage.
8425,919,Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyse the effectiveness of resistance exercise in functional fitness in women with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).Method: This is a randomized controlled clinical trial with 51 volunteers: 26 allocated to the exercise group (GEX) and 25 to the control group.
8426,919,"The GEX underwent a supervised resistance-training programme for 16weeks, with two sessions per week."
8427,919,"The outcomes measured were: functional capacity (FC), by the Fullerton Functional Fitness Test; Daily Motor Activity Index (DMAI), evaluated by an actigraph; disease activity, by the ESSDAI; and quality of life, by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)."
8428,919,"The evaluations were performed by a blind evaluator at baseline (T) and after 16weeks (T16wk).Results: In the GEX, all FC parameters demonstrated improvement, except for the upper limb flexibility test (p=0.866): upper and lower limb strength, flexibility, aerobic capacity, and agility (all p <0.01)."
8429,919,"A similar situation occurred in the SF-36, where all domains demonstrated improvement except for the emotional aspect (p=0.710): FC, physical aspects limitation, general health status, vitality, social aspects, and mental health (all p <0.01)."
8430,919,The DMAI (p=0.2) and EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) (p=0.284) did not change.
8431,919,"No significant improvement was observed in the control group.Conclusion: The supervised resistance exercise programme did not worsen the DMAI or disease activity, demonstrating the safety of the intervention, and was effective in improving FC and quality of life in women with pSS.Registry identifier (clinical trials.gov): NCT03130062."
8432,920,OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study is to examine the role of the outcome of the labial salivary gland biopsy (LSGB) in the diagnostic procedure of patients suspected of suffering from Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
8433,920,MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective study the result of histopathological assessment of 94 consecutively taken labial salivary gland biopsies has been examined.
8434,920,"For the diagnosis of SS the American-European Consensus Group classification (AECG, 2002) have been used."
8435,920,"The outcome of the assessment has been discussed in relation to a recently reported classification provided by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR, 2012)."
8436,920,RESULTS: In the 94 LSGBs support for a diagnosis of SS has been encountered in 24 out of 26 patients with SS.
8437,920,In the 68 patients with a negative diagnosis of SS only six positive LSGBs were observed.
8438,920,"The sensitivity of the labial biopsy amounted 0.92; the specificity was 0.91, while the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value amounted 0.80 and 0.97 respectively."
8439,920,LSGBs taken by or on the request of the departments of Rheumatology or Internal Medicine had a significant higher yield compared to LSGBs taken in other clinical departments.
8440,920,CONCLUSIONS: The LSGB may play a role in the diagnostic procedure of Sjgren's syndrome when using either the AECG classification or the ACR classification.
8441,920,A LSGB should preferably taken after counseling for the possible presence of SS by a department of Rheumatology or Internal Medicine since the yield of such biopsies is much higher than in patients who have not been counseled by these departments prior to the taking of a LSGB.
8442,920,"When using the ACR classification, a positive serologic result and a positive ocular test make the taking of a LSGB redundant."
8443,920,Only in case of a negative serologic outcome or a negative result of the ocular test a LSGB is indicated.
8444,920,"Since both the serologic test and the ocular test carry hardly any morbidity, these tests should, indeed, be performed first before considering to take a LSGB."
8445,921,PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of thermal pulsation treatment in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) and dry eye secondary to Sjogren disease.
8446,921,METHODS: Twenty-four eyes from 13 patients with previously diagnosed Sjogren disease who presented to our institution with dry eye symptoms and had thermal pulsation treatment were prospectively followed up.
8447,921,"Patients underwent comprehensive slit-lamp examination, including MGD grading, gland oil flow, corneal and conjunctival staining scores, and tear break-up time (TBUT)."
8448,921,Tear osmolarity was tested before and after treatment.
8449,921,"RESULTS: The average patient age was 62.4 years (range, 31-78 yrs); 12 were women and 1 a man."
8450,921,The average meibomian gland oil flow score showed an increase from pretreatment 0.71 to 1.75 at 1 year posttreatment (range 9-15 months) (P = 0.001).
8451,921,The average corneal staining score decreased from a pretreatment grade of 1.04 to a posttreatment grade of 0.36 (P < 0.001).
8452,921,The average conjunctival staining score decreased from a pretreatment grade of 1.5 to a posttreatment grade of 0.48 (P < 0.001).
8453,921,The average tear break-up time improved from 3.8 seconds before treatment to 7.5 seconds after thermal pulsation treatment (P < 0.001).
8454,921,There was no statistically significant change in the tear osmolarity or Ocular Surface Disease Index score.
8455,921,CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that MGD is an important contributor to dry eye disease in patients with Sjogren disease and should not be overlooked when considering treatment options.
8456,921,Thermal pulsation is a therapeutic option for patients with Sjogren disease who have MGD and dry eye symptoms.
8457,921,"After a single treatment, patients exhibited increased oil flow and tear break-up time with an associated decrease in corneal and conjunctival staining."
8458,922,"We evaluated the prevalence and clinical significance of cardiovascular risk factors in a large series of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS), focusing on the possible association with clinical and immunological SS features, the therapies administered, and the impact on cardiovascular disease."
8459,922,"The study cohort included 312 patients fulfilling the 2002 classification criteria for primary SS, consecutively evaluated and followed in our department between 1984 and 2009."
8460,922,The control group consisted of 312 age- and sex-matched patients without systemic autoimmune diseases followed during the study period in a primary care centre.
8461,922,"In comparison with the age- and sex-matched control group, patients with primary SS showed a higher frequency of diabetes mellitus (27% versus 13%, p < 0.001) and hypertriglyceridaemia (22% versus 15%, p = 0.023), and a lower frequency of hypertension (30% versus 46%, p < 0.001) and smoking (19% versus 31%, p < 0.001)."
8462,922,"The adjusted, multivariate analysis showed that SS patients with at least three cardiovascular risk factors had a higher mean age at SS diagnosis (p < 0.001), a higher frequency of liver involvement (p = 0.01) and central nervous system involvement (p = 0.001), higher mean levels of C-reactive protein (CRP, p = 0.001), a lower percentage of circulating gamma globulins (p = 0.001), and had received corticosteroids more frequently (p = 0.003) in comparison with patients without cardiovascular risk factors."
8463,922,"Patients who had received corticosteroids showed a higher frequency of hypertension (37% versus 25%, p = 0.032), diabetes mellitus (37% versus 21%, p = 0.002), and hypertriglyceridaemia (33% versus 15%, p < 0.001)."
8464,922,Patients with primary SS showed a twofold higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and a 1.5-fold higher prevalence of hypertriglyceridaemia in comparison with primary care patients.
8465,922,Corticosteroid use was closely associated with cardiovascular risk factors.
8466,922,These results suggest that cardiovascular risk factors should be taken into account in the management of patients with primary SS and show the importance of recognizing and controlling both traditional and SS-related modifiable risk factors.
8467,923,Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and severe complication of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
8468,923,Cohort studies indicate that the underlying diseases of PAH associated with connective tissue disease (CTD-PAH) in Asian countries are different from that in the United States and in Europe.
8469,923,"This study investigated the clinical characteristics, survival, and prognostic factors of pSS-PAH in Chinese patients."
8470,923,We enrolled 29 patients with pSS-PAH who visited our referral center during August 2007 and May 2015.
8471,923,PAH was confirmed by right heart catheterization (RHC).
8472,923,"Baseline demographic data, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, autoantibody results, hemodynamics data, and treatment regimens were analyzed."
8473,923,"All patients were followed up at the Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) every three to six months."
8474,923,All patients were female.
8475,923,Mean age of pSS onset was 34.411.1 years.
8476,923,Mean age of PAH diagnosed by RHC was 40.69.0 years.
8477,923,"There was no significant difference in age, disease duration, and hemodynamic findings between the survivors and the non-survivors in this cohort."
8478,923,"The overall one-, three-, and five-year survival rates were 80.2%, 74.8%, and 67.4%, respectively."
8479,923,"Prognostic factors of mortality were time between pSS onset and PAH onset (HR 1.102, 95% CI 1.017-1.185, p=0.018) and cardiac index<2l/min/m(2) (HR 5.497, 95% CI 1.063-28.434, p=0.042)."
8480,923,"In contrast, the use of immunosuppressants (HR 0.110, 95% CI 0.024-0.495, p=0.004) was related to better survival."
8481,923,This study demonstrates that the predictors of mortality in patients with pSS-PAH include delayed onset of PAH in pSS and worse cardiac function.
8482,923,Immunosuppressants can improve the prognosis of pSS-PAH.
8483,924,OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of anti-Ro52/60 antibodies by immunodot in patients with suspected SS.
8484,924,"METHODS: All patients between 2008 and 2012 with suspected SS without anti-SSA/SSB antibodies by ELISA and who had a determination of anti-SSA (Ro52/Ro60) antibodies by immunodot (Euroimmun, Germany) were retrospectively analysed."
8485,924,RESULTS: Eighty-four patients (median age 62 years; males 35 cases) were included.
8486,924,Forty-five patients had associated interstitial lung disease (ILD).
8487,924,"American-European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria for SS were fulfilled in 10 patients (12%) with a positive salivary gland biopsy, and among them 2 patients had anti-Ro52 antibodies by dot (20%)."
8488,924,"Among 74 patients with a negative salivary gland biopsy, 16 (22%) had anti-Ro52/60 antibodies and 10 (14%) fulfilled AECG criteria when including Ro52/60 antibodies."
8489,924,"A comparison of patients with and without anti-Ro52/60 antibodies revealed no differences, except gamma globulin levels and more frequent steroid use in patients with anti-Ro52/60 antibodies (P < 0.05)."
8490,924,"In 45 patients with ILD and dry eye/mouth syndrome, 10 (22%) had positive anti-Ro52/60 antibodies."
8491,924,In these patients 2 (4%) fulfilled AECG criteria without anti-Ro52/60 antibodies vs 4 (8%) patients if anti-Ro52/60 antibodies were included.
8492,924,"CONCLUSION: In patients with dry eye/mouth syndrome without anti-SSA/SSB antibodies by ELISA, the detection of anti-Ro52/Ro60 antibodies by dot could help in the diagnosis of SS."
8493,924,"In patients with ILD, the lower frequency of a Chisholm score 3 enhances the interest of anti-Ro52/Ro60 screening."
8494,925,OBJECTIVE: To compare features of SS in RA with primary SS and RA without SS.
8495,925,METHODS: Patients hospitalized between January 2007 and December 2010 were retrospectively studied.
8496,925,Seventy-four cases of overlap RA and SS (RA/SS) among 509 cases of RA were identified.
8497,925,Cases of SS (n = 187) detected during the same period acted as controls.
8498,925,"RESULTS: Among those with RA/SS, there were 46 cases of RA-onset SS and 12 cases of SS-onset RA."
8499,925,Sixteen patients had simultaneous-onset RA and SS.
8500,925,"Compared with RA without SS, RA/SS patients had more severe arthritis; a higher incidence of haematological abnormality, fever and rash; and a higher frequency of RF, ANAs and anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies (P < 0.05)."
8501,925,"Compared with primary SS, RA/SS patients were older, had more severe arthritis, anaemia and lung involvement; a lower incidence of fever, rash, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and hyperthyroidism; and a higher frequency of RF, anti-keratin antibody, anti-perinuclear factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated antibodies (P < 0.05)."
8502,925,"Compared with RA and primary SS, RA/SS patients had higher disease activity scores of both RA and SS."
8503,925,"CONCLUSION: RA/SS patients have distinctive features, with more complications and systemic involvement."
8504,925,"In addition, disease activity is higher in RA/SS."
8505,926,"In recent years, Burn Center has evolved to become a ""wound intensive care unit"" treating disease processes other than those due to thermal injury."
8506,926,"Recent data have shown that more than 16% of admissions to Burn Centers are for nonburn injuries, particularly severe dermatologic diseases."
8507,926,The role of the Burn Center has been expanded to include treatment of patients with severe cutaneous manifestations of rheumatologic diseases.
8508,926,This approach has not been described before.
8509,926,All collagen vascular disease admissions to the Burn Center from 2005 to 2010 have been reviewed.
8510,926,There were 16 admissions where intensive wound management was a major component of the disease management.
8511,926,"Disease processes included systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, antiphospholipid syndrome, and dermatomyositis, among others."
8512,926,The authors describe five of these cases in detail.
8513,926,"Comanagement of these patients by the Rheumatology and Burn services led to outstanding, successful outcomes."
8514,926,Collagen vascular diseases represent another area where the Burn Center may be the appropriate site for therapy.
8515,927,Metatarsalgia defined as pain at the plantar aspect of the forefoot.
8516,927,"Intermetatarsal bursitis is considered one potential soft-tissue cause of metatarsalgia that is presumably under-estimated, under-investigated, and, consequently, often misdiagnosed."
8517,927,To assess the role of MRI in the elucidation of the cause of metatarsalgia in patients with different autoimmune disorders presenting primarily with this symptom and to present the accompanying clinical and radiological findings of intermetatarsal bursitis.
8518,927,"Retrospective evaluation of the medical records of patients with different rheumatological conditions claiming primarily of pedal pains suggests metatarsalgia and who underwent, therefore, all magnetic resonance imaging between March 2010 and April 2018."
8519,927,"Of them, six patients fulfilled these criteria and were diagnosed subsequently with intermetatarsal bursitis."
8520,927,Several underlying autoimmune conditions were diagnosed.
8521,927,All patients were clinically assessed by the squeeze test and radiologically investigated with MRI; three patients underwent additional sonography.
8522,927,All patients presented intermetatarsal bursitis as first disease manifestation.
8523,927,The number of involved bursae ranged from one to three on one side.
8524,927,The main MR findings were distension of the intermetatarsal bursa with increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and post-contrast fat saturation T1-weighted images.
8525,927,Most frequent locations were the second and third intermetatarsal spaces.
8526,927,The size of the intermetatarsal bursitis and its plantar extension were correlated in all patients.
8527,927,Intermetatarsal bursitis can potentially be the first manifestation of different rheumatological diseases.
8528,927,Awareness of this potential association as well as cognizance of its imaging findings can help for making a more accurate and prompt earlier diagnosis of the underlying disease changing also the therapeutic approach.
8529,928,Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a life-threatening multisystem inflammatory condition that may affect almost any part of the eye.
8530,928,"We provide an update for the practicing ophthalmologist comprising a systematic review of the recent literature presented in the context of current knowledge of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of this condition."
8531,928,We review recent advances in the understanding of the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the development of SLE.
8532,928,Recent changes in the diagnostic criteria for SLE are considered.
8533,928,We assess the potential for novel molecular biomarkers to find a clinical application in disease diagnosis and stratification and in the development of therapeutic agents.
8534,928,"We discuss limited forms of SLE and their differentiation from other collagen vascular disorders and review recent evidence underlying the use of established and novel therapeutics in this condition, including specific implications regarding monitoring for ocular toxicity associated with antimalarials."
8535,929,"Primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary and tear glands, and autoantibody secretion, in the absence of other systemic autoimmune disorder."
8536,929,"Among autoimmune diseases, it is a relatively common disease, but the burden of central nervous system (CNS) involvement is controversial."
8537,929,"This retrospective study evaluates the prevalence, clinical patterns and outcomes of CNS involvement in a cohort of patients with primary Sjgren syndrome."
8538,929,We evaluated 93 patients with pSS diagnosed according to American-European Consensus Group criteria.
8539,929,Fourteen patients (15.1 %) had CNS involvement.
8540,929,All were women with an average age of onset of the disease of 42.1  14.7 years (average  SD) and an average age of onset of neurological involvement of 47.29  16 years.
8541,929,"Three had parkinsonian syndrome, two epilepsy, two motor and sensory deficits, two headache with brain magnetic resonance abnormalities, two neuromyelitis optica, two chronic progressive myelitis and one aseptic meningitis."
8542,929,"Neurological involvement preceded Sjgren syndrome diagnosis in nine of the patients (64 %), and neurological outcome was good in 11 patients (78.6 %)."
8543,929,"Central nervous involvement was not as rare as expected, and the frequency was similar to the frequency of peripheral nervous system involvement."
8544,929,"In half of the patients, this was the first symptom of the disease, emphasizing the importance of considering this diagnosis, especially in young female with neurological symptoms without other evident cause."
8545,930,BACKGROUND: Thymic lymphoid hyperplasia is often present with myasthenia gravis as well as other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.
8546,930,"Of the 4 cases of thymic lymphoid hyperplasia associated with Sjgren syndrome that have been reported, no case with a thymic lesion diagnosis that led to the diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome has been reported."
8547,930,"We herein report a case of thymic lymphoid hyperplasia with multilocular thymic cysts, diagnosed before Sjgren syndrome."
8548,930,CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old Japanese woman had an approximate 5-cm anterior mediastinal mass detected by chest imaging.
8549,930,The resected lesion revealed multilocular thymic cysts that were filled with colloid-like material.
8550,930,Histology showed lymph follicular hyperplasia with many epithelial cysts.
8551,930,"The epithelium consisted of thymic medullary epithelium, and no epithelial proliferation was seen in the lymphoid tissue."
8552,930,Lymphocytes were composed of an organized mixed population of mature T and B cells without significant atypia.
8553,930,The infiltrated B cells did not reveal light chain restriction or immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement.
8554,930,"After the pathological diagnosis of thymic lesion, tests for the presence of autoantibodies were positive for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatic factor, and anti-SSA/Ro antibodies."
8555,930,"The Schirmer's, chewing gum, and Saxon tests showed decreased salivary and lacrimal secretion."
8556,930,Lip biopsy showed focal lymphocytic sialadenitis.
8557,930,"The signs and symptoms of Sjgren syndrome had not resolved, without aggravation, 1 year after the thymectomy."
8558,930,"CONCLUSION: When a case with thymic lymphoid hyperplasia without myasthenia gravis is encountered, it is essential to consider the presence of another autoimmune disease including Sjgren syndrome."
8559,931,The aim of this study was to assess changes in salivary electrolyte flow and composition and the presence of anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB serum and saliva antibodies and their implications for the non-invasive diagnosis of SS.
8560,931,"STUDY DESIGN: 73 patients were studied, divided into the following experimental groups: primary Sjgren syndrome (SSp) (n=15), secondary SS (SSs) (n=17), dry mouth, dry eye without Sjgren's syndrome (BO) (n=20) and healthy controls (C) (n=21)."
8561,931,"We conducted a baseline assessment of salivary flow and saliva sampling for the measurement of sodium, chlorine, potassium, calcium and phosphate electrolytes, and the determination of anti-Ro/SSA and La/SSB antibodies; a serum sampling was made to assess antibody positivity."
8562,931,"RESULTS: Salivary flow in SSp, SSs and BO was significantly lower (p<0.001) relative to C. The salivary composition of SS showed an increase of inorganic components."
8563,931,"Anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies occurred more frequently in serum and saliva in SS patients compared with BO and C, with higher frequency of positivity in serum compared with saliva."
8564,931,CONCLUSION: Our results suggest new tools that could aid the non-traumatic diagnosis of the origin of hyposalivation.
8565,932,"Sjgren's syndrome is well known to target exocrine glands, especially lacrimal and salivary glands, which share with mammary glands anatomical, histological, and immunological features."
8566,932,"Herein, we investigated the mammary involvement in patients with Sjgren's syndrome and compared the histological findings with minor salivary gland involvement."
8567,932,"We reviewed the charts of patients with Sjgren's syndrome (followed in Montpellier University Hospital, between January 2000 and January 2015), in whom minor salivary gland and mammary tissues were available."
8568,932,Two expert pathologists analysed retrospectively these tissues in order to identify inflammatory patterns.
8569,932,Immunohistochemical stainings were performed to precise leucocyte distribution.
8570,932,Sixteen Sjgren's syndrome patients with available salivary and breast tissue samples were included.
8571,932,"All were women, with a median age of 60.111.3years at Sjgren's syndrome diagnosis."
8572,932,Mammary biopsy was conducted because of breast symptoms in 6 patients and following imaging screening strategies for breast cancer in 10 patients.
8573,932,"Nine patients exhibited an inflammatory breast pattern (lymphocytic infiltrates or duct ectasia), close to minor salivary gland histological findings."
8574,932,"Immunohistochemical stainings (n=5) revealed B and T cell infiltrates within breast tissue, with a higher proportion of T CD4+ cells, but no IgG4-secreting plasma cells were found."
8575,932,This is the first series to describe breast inflammatory patterns in Sjgren's syndrome.
8576,932,Mastitis is in line with the classical involvement of exocrine glands in this disease.
8577,932,"These findings are consistent with the literature data considering Sjgren's syndrome as an ""autoimmune epithelitis""."
8578,933,Human and animal model studies suggest CXCL13 is a potential biomarker in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
8579,933,CXCL13 has not been studied in Indian patients with pSS.
8580,933,"pSS cases classified by American European Consensus Group (AECG) or American college of Rheumatology(ACR) 2012 criteria, attending rheumatology clinic between July 2014 and July 2015 were included."
8581,933,"Hospital staff and healthy, non-blood related family members of patients constituted the control group."
8582,933,"pSS cases underwent clinical evaluation, laboratory investigations, ESSDAI and ESSPRI scoring."
8583,933,Unstimulated saliva was collected by the spitting method.
8584,933,Salivary and serum CXCL13 were quantified by indirect ELISA.
8585,933,CXCL13 positivity was determined using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve.
8586,933,"STATA13.1 (StataCorpLP,Texas,USA) software was used for statistical analysis."
8587,933,"In this study, 45 pSS cases and 42 healthy controls were recruited."
8588,933,"In pSS, median levels of serum CXCL13, but not salivary CXCL13 was significantly higher as compared to the corresponding levels in healthy controls (p<0.001)."
8589,933,"Using cutoff of 43.03pg/ml obtained by ROC, serum CXCL13 positivity was seen in 31/43(72.1%) cases and 10/34 (29.4%) controls, respectively."
8590,933,"Serum CXCL13 levels among pSS patients on treatment, treatment nave patients and healthy controls were statistically different."
8591,933,"Serum CXCL13 positivity was associated with oral symptoms (p=0.02), ocular signs (p=0.03) and hyperglobulinemia (p=0.01)."
8592,933,There was no association of salivary CXCL13 level with any of the clinical variables.
8593,933,"While serum CXCL13 was elevated in pSS, salivary CXCL13 was not."
8594,933,"In conclusion, serum CXCL13 positivity was found to be associated with oral symptoms, ocular signs and hyperglobulinemiain pSS."
8595,934,"PURPOSE: To asses the possibility of an endoscopic technique to diagnose, treat, and maintain the salivary glands in patients with Sjgren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus."
8596,934,PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 8 patients with Sjgren syndrome and 2 with systemic lupus erythematosus with affected salivary glands were included in the present study.
8597,934,"The treatment approach included parotid sialoendoscopy with thorough rinsing, and Stenson's duct dilation using hydrostatic pressure and a high-pressure balloon."
8598,934,Hydrocortisone 100 mg was injected through direct vision into the duct.
8599,934,The study was exempt by the Barzilai Medical Center review board.
8600,934,"RESULTS: The main diagnosis of the patients was chronic recurrent parotitis, with the exception of 1 patient, who presented with salivary stones."
8601,934,CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic features of the salivary glands resulting from Sjgren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus can be managed successfully using an endoscopic approach.
8602,935,BACKGROUND: Diagnostic criteria for Sjgren's syndrome (SS) are continually being updated in pursuit of more precise and earlier diagnosis to prevent its complications.
8603,935,"Owing to the high rate of false negative traditional serological markers, the need for better serological testing remains."
8604,935,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical significance of three recently discovered novel autoantibodies, anti-salivary gland protein 1 (SP1), anti-carbonic anhydrase 6 (CA6), and anti-parotid secretory protein (PSP), in a cohort of dry eye patients with suspected underlying inflammatory/autoimmune disease."
8605,935,METHODS: Medical records of 136 patients with a primary diagnosis of dry eye who underwent laboratory testing between April 2014 and July 2017 were reviewed retrospectively.
8606,935,"Data regarding demographic information, ocular and systemic symptoms, previous medical diagnoses, serological test results, and minor salivary gland biopsy results were collected."
8607,935,"Dry eye evaluations included tear osmolarity, Schirmer test without anesthesia, conjunctival lissamine green staining, and corneal fluorescein staining in the order listed here."
8608,935,"RESULTS: Of the 136 patients, 9 (9/136, 6.6%) presented with a history of SS, and 9 additional patients (9/127, 7%) received a new diagnosis of SS as a result of evaluations."
8609,935,"Fifty-six patients (56/136, 41%) tested positive for at least one of the novel autoantibodies."
8610,935,Fifty-four percent (6/11) of patients with primary SS who underwent the novel serological testing had a positive anti-PSP.
8611,935,"Of those, 2 (2/11, 18%) had negative traditional serology and had to undergo minor salivary gland biopsy for definitive diagnosis."
8612,935,"Anti-CA6 was associated with increased corneal and conjunctival staining after adjusting for age, sex, and other serologic markers (HR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.20-1.97, and p = 0.009 and HR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.04-1.76, and p = 0.02, respectively)."
8613,935,CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study demonstrated that anti-CA6 is seen in patients with severe aqueous-deficient dry eye.
8614,935,Whether these patients have an early stage of SS or a different type of autoimmune condition may be determined through longitudinal studies.
8615,936,BACKGROUND: The prevalence of connective tissue disease (CTD) induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) in the absence of pre-existing autoimmunity is unknown.
8616,936,"CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a melanoma patient treated for 8months with pembrolizumab who developed a subacute ataxic sensory neuronopathy (SNN), including a right trigeminal neuropathy."
8617,936,"Salivary gland biopsy showed inflammatory changes suggestive of Sjgren's syndrome, while brain MRI revealed enhancement of the right trigeminal ganglia."
8618,936,"A high level of protein and pleocytosis was found in the cerebrospinal fluid, with negative cultures."
8619,936,"Nerve conduction studies revealed the absence of sensory nerve action potentials in the upper and lower limbs and reduced motor responses in the upper limbs, fulfilling criteria for SNN."
8620,936,"Blood tests revealed an important inflammatory syndrome, hemolytic anemia, elevation of total IgG levels and the presence of ANA autoantibodies specific to anti-SSA (52 and 60 kd)."
8621,936,All these elements were absent before the initiation of the treatment with pembrolizumab.
8622,936,"Initially, there was a clinical response following intravenous frontline methylprednisone, but the subacute relapse required the introduction of second-line treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins and then rituximab, which led to a quick clinical improvement."
8623,936,"CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we describe the first case of a patient who developed a typical SNN as a complication of severe neuro-Sjgren's syndrome induced by pembrolizumab treatment."
8624,937,This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of Dendrobium candidum extract in promoting expression of aquaporin-5 for treatment of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
8625,937,Sixteen patients with SS suffered from deficient secretion of saliva due to an autoimmune destruction of salivary glands leading to dry mouth symptoms (xerostomia).
8626,937,"However, glandular dysfunction also occurred without destruction."
8627,937,"Based upon its abnormal distribution in SS salivary glands, a potential role of the water channel protein aquaporin-5 (AQP-5) in the pathogenesis of SS was proposed."
8628,937,"After oral administration of D. candidum extracted liquid (DCEL) for 1 week, saliva and salivary gland biopsies from labial glands of patients were collected and examined by employing immunoreactivity and immunohistochemistry techniques."
8629,937,Results showed that salivary secretion increased by about 65% in patients treated with DCEL as compared with the control group.
8630,937,Higher labeling indices (percentage of acinus area immunoreactive for AQP-5) in the biopsies were found in SS patients who had taken DCEL.
8631,937,This study demonstrated that D. candidum would regulate the expression of AQP-5 in labial glands of SS patients and thereby promoted secretion of saliva to improve dry mouth symptoms.
8632,938,The use of musculoskeletal ultrasound in rheumatology clinical practice has rapidly increased over the past decade.
8633,938,"Ultrasound has enabled rheumatologists to diagnose, prognosticate and monitor disease outcome."
8634,938,"Although international standardization remains a concern still, the use of ultrasound in rheumatology is expected to grow further as costs fall and the opportunity to train in the technique improves."
8635,938,"We present a review of value of ultrasound, focusing on major applications of ultrasound in rheumatologic diseases."
8636,939,"Five per cent of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) develop malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), usually of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and most frequently located in the major salivary glands."
8637,939,"Rituximab (RTX), a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the CD20 molecule expressed on the surface of mature B cells that has been approved for the treatment of NHL, has been used to treat pSS-associated lymphoma."
8638,939,We have described two cases: one with MALT lymphoma in the parotid glands and the other with a rare thymus lymphoma accompanied by the rare complication of a bullous pneumopathy.
8639,939,"Both were treated with RTX at haematological doses, which was unsuccessful in the patient with a salivary lymphoma; in the case of the patient with a thymus lymphoma, the mediastinum mass disappeared and did not relapse."
8640,939,"Both patients experienced an improvement in the subjective symptoms of dryness, and their Schirmer's test and scialoscintigraphy results stabilised."
8641,939,The pulmonary bullae remained unchanged.
8642,940,"OBJECTIVES: To assess subclinical central nervous system (CNS) involvement in primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS), by comparing standard brain MRI, in-depth neuropsychological testing and (99m)Tc-ECD brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of patients with pSS with matched controls."
8643,940,"METHODS: 10 women (<55 years old), with pSS defined using European-American criteria, presence of anti-SSA and/or anti-SSB antibodies and no history of neurological involvement were prospectively investigated, and compared with 10 age- and sex-matched controls."
8644,940,"All subjects underwent, within 1 month, brain MRI, neuropsychological testing, including overall evaluation and focal cognitive function assessment, and (99m)Tc-ECD brain SPECT."
8645,940,RESULTS: (99m)Tc-ECD brain SPECT abnormalities were significantly more common in patients with pSS (10/10) than controls (2/10; p<0.05).
8646,940,"Cognitive dysfunctions, mainly expressed as executive and visuospatial disorders, were also significantly more common in patients with pSS (8/10) than controls (0/10; p<0.01)."
8647,940,"Notably, between-group comparisons enabled a significant correlation to be established between neuropsychological assessment and (99m)Tc-ECD brain SPECT abnormalities in patients with pSS (r(s) = 0.49, p<0.01)."
8648,940,MRI abnormalities in patients and controls did not differ significantly.
8649,940,CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychological testing and (99m)Tc-ECD brain SPECT seem to be the most sensitive tools to detect subclinical CNS dysfunction in pSS.
8650,940,The strong correlation between cortical hypoperfusion in (99m)Tc-ECD brain SPECT and cognitive dysfunction suggests an organic aetiology of CNS dysfunction in pSS.
8651,940,These data should be confirmed in a larger study.
8652,941,Background The involvement of the central nervous system in primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) remains controversial.
8653,941,Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a relatively new method that can be applied to investigate the heterogeneity of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in pSS patients through regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis.
8654,941,"Purpose To collect data from pSS patients and healthy controls, and use ReHo analysis to elucidate the neurobiological mechanism of CNS involvement in pSS."
8655,941,Material and Methods Fourteen clinically diagnosed pSS patients and 14 age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent resting-state fMRI.
8656,941,The data were processed by ReHo analysis.
8657,941,The double sample t-test was used to compare ReHo data between groups.
8658,941,"Results Compared to controls, pSS patients had significantly increased ReHo values in the right cerebrum, left limbic lobe, right middle temporal gyrus, and the inferior parietal lobe."
8659,941,"However, ReHo values significantly decreased in the right lingual gyrus, left cuneiform lobe, left superior occipital gyrus, bilateral middle occipital gyrus, and the fronto-parietal junction area ( P<0.01, clusters50 voxels)."
8660,941,"Conclusion This study demonstrates the abnormal brain activity in the visual cortex and fronto-parietal junction area in pSS patients, suggesting pathological neuronal dysfunction in these regions."
8661,942,INTRODUCTION: Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) is a transversal myelitis that extends through three or more vertebral segments in length.
8662,942,"CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old woman was hospitalized due to pain in the lumbar region, difficulty in walking, hypoesthesia of the anogenital area and urinary retention."
8663,942,"In the past medical history, two years earlier, the patient had been diagnosed with transversal myelitis confirmed by MRI of the cervical spine and six months earlier, the patient was diagnosed with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
8664,942,During the current hospitalization MRM of the spinal cord revealed extensive inflammatory lesions of almost the whole spinal cord.
8665,942,Lumbar puncture (LP) revealed mild pleocytosis and slightly increased protein level.
8666,942,Isoelectric focusing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum proteins was normal.
8667,942,Visual evoked potentials were normal.
8668,942,Serological testing excluded acute viral infections.
8669,942,Corticosteroid therapy was applied with good therapeutic response.
8670,942,Control MRI revealed regression of pathological changes in the spinal cord.
8671,942,"CONCLUSION: A wide range of disorders can cause LETM, but usually the first line diagnosis is neuromyelitis optica (NMO)."
8672,942,"Based on the detection of NMO immunoglobulin G in the serum of affected patients, a variety of allied disorders were grouped under the name of NMO spectrum disorders, including recurrent myelitis associated with LETM and myelitis associated with autoimmune disorders such as SS."
8673,942,There have been only a few cases reported in the literature with recurrent LETM associated with non-organ specific autoimmune disorder.
8674,943,OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of rheumatoid factor (RF) isotype for the detection of primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) and evaluate the clinical and serological associations of immunoglobulin (Ig) A RF in patients with pSS.
8675,943,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: RF levels were measured in 77 and 37 patients with pSS and idiopathic sicca symptoms, respectively, using ELISA and analysed with respect to clinical and laboratory disease characteristics."
8676,943,Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine and compare the diagnostic accuracy of IgA RF with other diagnostic tests.
8677,943,RESULTS: Serum levels of IgA RF were significantly higher in patients with pSS than in those with idiopathic sicca symptoms.
8678,943,"IgA RF showed sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of 83.1, 78.4, 88.9, and 69.0%, respectively, for pSS diagnosis."
8679,943,"IgA RF was associated with xerostomia, severe sialoscintigraphic grade, low unstimulated salivary flow rate (USFR), antinuclear antibody, high IgG and IgM/G RF levels, and low C3 levels in patients with pSS."
8680,943,IgA RF titres had positive correlations with sialoscintigraphic grade and IgG and IgG/M RF levels and had negative correlations with USFR and C3 levels.
8681,943,CONCLUSION: Our findings confirmed the potential of IgA RF to distinguish pSS from idiopathic sicca symptoms.
8682,943,The presence of IgA RF in patients with pSS was associated with significantly worse exocrine function and active serologic profile.
8683,943,No association between IgA RF and extra-glandular manifestations was noted.
8684,943,CLINICAL RELEVANCE: IgA RF should be the predictive and diagnostic marker in patients with pSS.
8685,944,Ectopic expression of MHC II molecules on glandular cells is a feature of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
8686,944,"However, the cause of this ectopic expression and its potential role in the pathogenesis of the disease remains elusive."
8687,944,"Here, we report that ectopic expression of MHC II molecules on glandular cells represents an early presymptomatic event in a mouse model of pSS induced by immunization of Ro60_316-335 peptide emulsified in TiterMax as an adjuvant."
8688,944,Ectopic expression of MHC II was induced by TiterMax but not by complete freund's adjuvant (CFA).
8689,944,"Furthermore, immunization with Ro60_316-335 peptide emulsified in TiterMax, but not in CFA, induced a pSS-like disease in mice."
8690,944,Our results suggests that ectopic expression of MHC II molecules on glandular cells represents a presymptomatic feature of pSS and that such ectopic expression can be induced by exogenous factors.
8691,944,"In addition, this study also provides a novel mechanism how adjuvants can amplify immune responses."
8692,945,"Sjgren syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune rheumatic disease characterized by a progressive lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands, especially salivary and lachrymal ones, leading to xerostomia, parotid gland enlargement, and xerophthalmia."
8693,945,The aim of this study is to describe the capillaroscopic pattern of the interdental papilla in patients with SS and to evaluate a possible correlation with periodontal disease.
8694,945,METHODS: A total of 25 patients affected by SS and 25 healthy controls were examined.
8695,945,"The patients with conditions that compromise microcirculation, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or some pharmacological treatments, were not included in the study."
8696,945,All the patients were nonsmokers.
8697,945,Periodontal capillaroscopy has been used to investigate the features of microcirculation.
8698,945,"Visibility, course, tortuosity, as well as the possible presence of microhemorrhage, the average caliber of the capillary loops, and the number of visible capillary loops per square millimeter were evaluated for each patient."
8699,945,"RESULTS: The results show evident alterations to the capillaries and a typical conformation of the interdental papilla microcirculation in patients with SS; it was possible to observe a reduced caliber of capillaries, as well as a greater number and tortuosity of capillary loops."
8700,945,CONCLUSION: This study shows that capillary alterations to patients with SS occur in gingival microcirculation.
8701,946,INTRODUCTION: Subjects with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) have an increased risk of developing B-cell lymphoma and may harbor monoclonal B-cell expansions in the peripheral blood.
8702,946,"Expanded B-cell clones could be pathogenic, and their persistence could exacerbate disease or predispose toward the development of lymphoma."
8703,946,Therapy with anti-CD20 (rituximab) has the potential to eliminate expanded B-cell clones and thereby potentially ameliorate disease.
8704,946,This study was undertaken to identify and track expanded B-cell clones in the blood of subjects with primary SjS who were treated with rituximab.
8705,946,"METHODS: To determine whether circulating B-cell clones in subjects with primary SjS emerge or remain after B cell-depleting therapy with rituximab, we studied the antibody heavy-chain repertoire."
8706,946,We performed single-memory B-cell and plasmablast sorting and antibody heavy-chain sequencing in six rituximab-treated SjS subjects over the course of a 1-year follow-up period.
8707,946,"RESULTS: Expanded B-cell clones were identified in four out of the six rituximab-treated SjS subjects, based upon the independent amplification of sequences with identical or highly similar VH, DH, and JH gene segments."
8708,946,We identified one SjS subject with a large expanded B-cell clone that was present prior to therapy and persisted after therapy.
8709,946,"Somatic mutations in the clone were numerous but did not increase in frequency over the course of the 1-year follow-up, suggesting that the clone had been present for a long period of time."
8710,946,"Intriguingly, a majority of the somatic mutations in the clone were silent, suggesting that the clone was under chronic negative selection."
8711,946,"CONCLUSIONS: For some subjects with primary SjS, these data show that (a) expanded B-cell clones are readily identified in the peripheral blood, (b) some clones are not eliminated by rituximab, and (c) persistent clones may be under chronic negative selection or may not be antigen-driven."
8712,946,The analysis of sequence variation among members of an expanded clone may provide a novel means of measuring the chronicity and selection of expanded B-cell populations in humans.
8713,947,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in salivary gland echostructure and vascularization after rituximab treatment in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
8714,947,"METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with primary SS included in the multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Tolerance and Efficacy of Rituximab in Primary Sjgren's Syndrome (TEARS) trial underwent salivary gland ultrasonography before the first placebo or rituximab infusion and then 6 months later."
8715,947,"Trial inclusion criteria were scores of 50 mm on at least 2 of 4 visual analog scales (VAS) evaluating dryness, pain, fatigue, and global disease; and recent-onset (<10 years) biologically active primary SS and/or systemic primary SS."
8716,947,Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to rituximab (1 gm at weeks 0 and 2) or placebo.
8717,947,"Ultrasonography of both parotid and submandibular glands was performed to assess echostructure (using a semiquantitative score of 0-4, with improvement defined as a 1-point decrease), size of each gland, and vascularization based on the resistive index of the transverse facial artery of the parotid gland before and after lemon juice stimulation."
8718,947,"RESULTS: Of the 28 patients, 5 (18%; 3 in the placebo group and 2 in the rituximab group) had clinically detectable bilateral parotid gland enlargement at baseline."
8719,947,Parotid parenchyma echostructure improved in 50% of the rituximab-treated patients versus 7% of the placebo-treated patients (P=0.03).
8720,947,"In the submandibular glands, echostructure also improved in a larger proportion of rituximab-treated patients, although the difference was not significant (36% versus 7% of placebo-treated patients; P=0.16)."
8721,947,Gland sizes and resistive index remained unchanged.
8722,947,"CONCLUSION: Ultrasonography showed improved salivary gland echostructure in patients with primary SS receiving rituximab, with no changes in salivary gland size or vascularization, 6 months after the first infusion."
8723,948,OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether epigenetic cell counting represents a novel method to quantify immune cells in salivary glands of patients with different forms of Sjgren's and sicca syndrome and to capture immunopathology and potentially aid in diagnosis.
8724,948,"METHODS: DNA from frozen salivary gland tissue sections of sicca patients was used for bisulphite conversion of demethylated DNA cytosine residues, followed by cell-specific quantitative PCR to calculate cell percentages in relation to total tissue cell numbers as quantified by housekeeping gene demethylation."
8725,948,The percentages of epigenetically quantified cells were correlated to RNA expression of matched salivary gland tissue and histological and clinical parameters.
8726,948,"RESULTS: The percentages of epigenetically quantified CD3, CD4, CD8, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, FoxP3+ regulatory T cells and B cells were significantly increased in the salivary glands of patients with SS."
8727,948,Unsupervised clustering using these percentages identified patient subsets with an increased lymphocytic focus score and local B cell hyperactivity and classifies patients different from conventional classification criteria.
8728,948,"In particular, Tfh cells were shown to strongly correlate with the expression of CXCL13, lymphocytic focus scores, local B cell hyperactivity and anti-SSA positivity."
8729,948,"CONCLUSION: Epigenetic cell counting is a promising novel tool to objectively and easily quantify immune cells in the labial salivary gland of sicca patients, with a relatively small amount of tissue needed."
8730,948,"In view of the potential of this technique to include a huge number of (cell-specific) biomarkers, this opens up new standardized ways of salivary gland analysis with high relevance for patient classification, understanding of immunopathology and monitoring of drug responses in clinical trials."
8731,949,"OBJECTIVE: To identify independent contributors of fatigue in primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) patients, taking into account clinical, laboratory, and psychological features, and to explore the potential role of interferon (IFN)-induced gene indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1), anti-21-hydroxylase (anti-21[OH]) antibodies, and soluble BAFF."
8732,949,METHODS: Detailed clinical and laboratory characteristics were recorded for 106 primary SS patients.
8733,949,"The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, Zung Depression Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Scale, and Athens Insomnia Scale were adopted to assess fatigue, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, respectively."
8734,949,"Peripheral whole blood expression levels of IDO-1, as well as type I and II IFN-induced genes were calculated using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction."
8735,949,"Serum anti-21(OH) antibodies and soluble BAFF levels were determined by a radioimmunoassay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively."
8736,949,Univariate and multivariate models were performed to identify determinants of fatigue.
8737,949,RESULTS: Fatigue was detected in 32 of 106 (30.2%) primary SS patients.
8738,949,"In univariate analysis, fatigue was associated with arthralgias/myalgias, fibromyalgia hydroxychloroquine therapy, both state and trait anxiety scores, depression, and neuroticism, as well as impaired sleep patterns."
8739,949,"Multivariate analysis revealed neuroticism (odds ratio [OR] 6.9, [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.7-28.0]), depression (OR 3.0 [95% CI 0.8-11.0]), and fibromyalgia (OR 5.5 [95% CI 1.1-27.7]) as independent fatigue contributors."
8740,949,"Soluble BAFF levels, anti-21(OH) autoantibodies, and IDO-1 messenger RNA expression did not significantly differ between fatigued and nonfatigued primary SS patients."
8741,949,"CONCLUSION: Depression, neuroticism, and fibromyalgia play a major role in primary SS-associated fatigue and should be addressed in clinical practice, with active collaboration between rheumatologists and mental health professionals."
8742,949,Further studies are warranted in order to explore underlying pathophysiologic pathways that might explain fatigue in the setting of primary SS.
8743,950,Lamin A/C proteins are major components of nuclear laminae and were encoded by the LMNA gene.
8744,950,Recent studies have found that in addition to provides nuclear-membrane strength; it also regulates the gene expression.
8745,950,"Lamin A/C has been confirmed as an autoantigen in RA, SLE and vasculitis."
8746,950,Anti-Lamin A/C antibodies also have been found by indirect immunofluorescence method.
8747,950,"In this study, we used various research methods to confirm Lamin A/C is an autoantigen in Han Chinese patients with confirmed Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
8748,950,"To further investigate the relationship between the autoimmune disease antigens, we compared the amino acid sequence of Lamin A/C epitope and several common antigens' antigenic determinant."
8749,950,"As a result, we found that Lamin A/C has similar epitopes with U1RNP."
8750,950,It means that the potential relationship exist between Lamin A/C and U1RNP.
8751,950,Clinical data we collected also showed that anti-Lamin A/C and anti-U1RNP antibodies always appear in same serum sample.
8752,950,"Therefore, we speculated that cross-reaction may take place between antigen and potential antigen, which have similar epitope."
8753,950,"Then, by epitope spreading, the potential antigen can be a new autoantigen."
8754,950,Our study provided a new thinking for further research about the relationship between autoantigens and their development mechanism in autoimmune diseases.
8755,951,Saliva diagnostics has become an attractive field utilizing nanotechnology and molecular technologies for pSS (primary Sjgren's syndrome).
8756,951,"However, no specific methods have been established."
8757,951,"To refine the diagnostic power of the saliva peptide finger print for the early detection of pSS, we screened the expression spectrum of salivary peptides in pSS patients by using mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF-MS (matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight MS) combined with magnetic bead."
8758,951,The present study was comprised 12 pSS patients and 13 healthy controls and broken down to two different phases.
8759,951,"In the initial 'exploratory phase', we enrolled seven pSS patients with eight age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers."
8760,951,Proteomics analysis of the unstimulated salivary samples was conducted to generate proportional peptide mass fingerprints.
8761,951,A diagnostic model was established.
8762,951,The testing cohort of the second 'validation phase' was represented by five pSS patients and five age- and sex-matched healthy controls.
8763,951,The diagnostic power of this diagnostic panel was then validated.
8764,951,The results showed seven m/z (mass-to-charge) ratio peaks with significant differences.
8765,951,Five peptides were up-regulated and two down-regulated in the pSS patients compared with matched healthy subjects.
8766,951,"In the validation phase, four out of five pSS patients were diagnosed as pSS, and four of the five healthy controls were diagnosed as healthy controls, respectively."
8767,951,Potential biomarkers were also primarily predicted.
8768,951,"The novel diagnostic proteomic model with m/z peaks 1068.1 Da, 1196.2 Da, 1738.4 Da, 3375.3 Da, 3429.3 Da, 3449.7 Da and 3490.6 Da is of certain value for early diagnosis of pSS."
8769,952,PURPOSE: To evaluate the presence of dry eye and primary Sjgren syndrome (SS) in patients with migraine.
8770,952,"METHODS: In total, 46 eyes of 46 patients with migraine (group 1) and 50 eyes of 50 healthy subjects (group 2) were included in this study."
8771,952,"Detailed ophthalmologic, neurologic and rheumatologic examination were performed on all participants."
8772,952,"Ocular surface disease index questionnaire, tear function tests, visual analog scale for pain, serologic analysis were also performed."
8773,952,RESULTS: Dry eye symptoms and findings were significantly higher and more severe in group 1 when compared with group 2.
8774,952,Primary SS was not found in any of the participants.
8775,952,The migraine lifetime duration was negatively correlated with the tear function tests while it was positively correlated with the ocular surface disease index scores.
8776,952,CONCLUSIONS: Dry eye symptoms and findings are higher in migraine patients when compared with the healthy subjects without the presence of Sjgren syndrome.
8777,953,OBJECTIVE: Salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) has been applied in the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
8778,953,"The aim of this study is to investigate the association of SGUS findings with clinical, histological, and serologic features of SS."
8779,953,METHODS: A total of 104 patients with suspected SS underwent SGUS for evaluation of salivary gland involvement.
8780,953,Patients with primary SS were determined according to the classification criteria for SS.
8781,953,The parenchymal inhomogeneity of bilateral parotid and submandibular glands was graded from 0 (homogeneity) to 4 (gross inhomogeneity).
8782,953,Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to compare the diagnostic performance of different SGUS scoring methods.
8783,953,Clinical and serologic features were compared between groups classified by SGUS score.
8784,953,The association between SGUS and these features of SS was explored by multivariable linear regression analysis.
8785,953,RESULTS: Study participants were predominantly women (96.2%) and had a mean age of 54.1years.
8786,953,"Eighty-seven patients and 88 patients with primary SS were identified based on AECG criteria and ACR/EULAR classification criteria for SS, respectively."
8787,953,"Among the different scoring methods, the sum of the grades of four salivary glands (range 0-16) had the best diagnostic performance, with sensitivity of 77.3% and specificity of 87.5% (cutoff value, 7) for distinguishing primary SS from sicca non-SS."
8788,953,"SGUS score was associated with focus score in labial salivary gland biopsy (=0.240, p=0.033) and anti-Ro/SSA serology (=0.283, p=0.016) and inversely associated with unstimulated whole salivary flow (=-0.298, p=0.011)."
8789,953,"CONCLUSION: Ultrasonography of major salivary glands is associated with histopathology of minor salivary glands, serology of SS, and salivary gland function."
8790,954,"BACKGROUND: Premature ovarian failure is diagnosed with a picture of amenorrhea, elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and age under 40 years."
8791,954,Twenty percent (20%) of patients with premature ovarian failure have a concomitant autoimmune disease.
8792,954,Cases of premature ovarian failure associated with Sjgren syndrome have been reported in the literature.
8793,954,PATIENT AND METHOD: We report a case of a 42-year-old white woman with Sjgren syndrome and premature ovarian failure who underwent a reversal of her premature ovarian failure and restoration of normal menses using an elimination diet protocol.
8794,954,"The patient was diagnosed with her rheumatological condition in 2005 and started on disease-modifying antirheumatoid drugs, which were taken intermittently due to a concern over medication side-effects."
8795,954,"Her menses became irregular at the time of initial diagnosis and finally ceased in 2006, with a dramatic elevation in her FSH, indicative of autoimmune-induced premature ovarian failure."
8796,954,"In March 2009, she commenced an elimination diet protocol, eliminating gluten, beef, eggs, dairy products, nightshade vegetables, refined sugars, and citrus fruit for 4 months."
8797,954,RESULTS: Her repeat laboratory tests after 4 months showed a drop in FSH from 88 to 6.5 and a drop in erythrocyte sedimentation rate from 40 to 16.
8798,954,Her menses also resumed and her rheumatological symptoms significantly improved.
8799,954,CONCLUSIONS: It is hypothesized that the restoration of normal menses was caused by reduced inflammation in the ovarian tissue and supports the hypothesis that the gut immune system can influence autoimmune disease and inflammation.
8800,955,Autoimmune diseases of major salivary glands include Sjgren's syndrome and a complex of disorders classified as immunoglobulin G4-related diseases.
8801,955,These pathologies are characterised by an autoimmune reaction mediated by T-helper lymphocytes that targets the ducts of exocrine glands in Sjgren's syndrome and glandular parenchyma in immunoglobulin G4-related diseases.
8802,955,Immunoglobulin G4-related diseases represent recently introduced multi-organ diseases that also involve the salivary glands.
8803,955,"However, the morbid conditions once known as Mikulicz's disease and Kuttner's tumour were recently considered as two variants of immunoglobulin G4-related diseases affecting the major salivary glands ( immunoglobulin G4-related sialadenitis)."
8804,955,"This review briefly summarises the pathogenesis and clinical features of autoimmune diseases of the major salivary glands, focusing on the diagnostic and therapeutic role of sialendoscopy."
8805,956,OBJECTIVES: To investigate clinical characteristics of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) who were negative for anti-Ro/SSA antibody but positive for minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) compared to patients who presented positivity for anti-Ro/SSA antibody.
8806,956,"METHODS: The data of 355 patients from the Korean Initiative of primary Sjgren's Syndrome (KISS), a nationwide prospective cohort for primary SS in Korea, were analysed."
8807,956,All patients fulfilled the 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria.
8808,956,"Of these patients, 326 were positive for anti-Ro/SSA antibody and 29 were antibody-negative, although they had positive findings in MSGB."
8809,956,"Various clinical features including all kinds of tests for evaluating secretory function, disease-related clinical indices and serological values available in the cohort were compared between the two groups."
8810,956,"RESULTS: The anti-Ro/SSA-negative group showed less rheumatoid factor positivity (p<0.001), leucopenia (p=0.003), hyper-gammaglobulinaemia (p<0.001), lower serum 2-microglobulin level (p=0.034), more anti-centromere antibody positivity (p<0.001), higher score in dryness domain of EULAR SS patient-reported index (p=0.048) and more positivity for peripheral nervous system domain in EULAR SS disease activity index and loss of teeth in SS disease damage index (p=0.021 and 0.041, respectively) than patients who were positive for anti-Ro/ SSA antibody."
8811,956,CONCLUSIONS: Primary SS patients who are negative for anti-Ro/SSA antibody have different clinical characteristics compared to patients who are positive for such antibody in Korea.
8812,956,"Therefore, clinicians should consider MSGB in patients with suspicious symptoms who are anti-Ro/SSA-negative."
8813,957,A 25-year-old woman diagnosed 1 year earlier with Primary Sjogren's syndrome was admitted to a nearby hospital with fever of unknown origin.
8814,957,"Examination revealed anasarca, systemic lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and high C-reactive protein level."
8815,957,The patient's symptoms were initially suspected to be caused by severe bacterial infection with Sjogren's syndrome flare.
8816,957,She was given antibiotics and prednisolone (PSL) at 50 mg/day.
8817,957,"However, the patient developed anemia and thrombocytopenia and was transferred to our hospital for further care."
8818,957,Histological examination of the right inguinal lymph node showed neutrophilic infiltration.
8819,957,Bone marrow aspiration revealed a normocellular marrow with increased megakaryocytes and mild reticulin fiber hyperplasia.
8820,957,"After initiation of minocycline hydrochloride, the patient's symptoms improved."
8821,957,"However, as PSL was tapered, her symptoms worsened."
8822,957,The patient's clinical symptoms and laboratory data improved again with initiation of intravenous steroid pulse therapy and cyclosporine.
8823,957,"TAFRO syndrome is characterized by a constellation of symptoms: Thrombocytopenia, Anasarca, Fever, Reticulin fibrosis and Organomegaly."
8824,957,"Although histological findings of the lymph node in this case differed from previous reports, the patient's other symptoms and clinical course were similar to TAFRO syndrome."
8825,957,"TAFRO syndrome can occur with several diseases, including infection, rheumatic disease and malignancies."
8826,957,We report a case in which infection might have triggered TAFRO syndrome.
8827,958,"The aim of this longitudinal prospective study was to evaluate the effects of periodontal treatment on the clinical, microbiological and immunological periodontal parameters, and on the systemic activity (ESSDAI) and subjective (ESSPRI) indexes in patients with primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS)."
8828,958,"Twenty-eight female patients were divided into four groups: pSS patients with or without chronic periodontitis (SCP, SC, respectively), and systemically healthy patients with or without chronic periodontitis (CP, C, respectively)."
8829,958,"Periodontal clinical examination and immunological and microbiological sample collection were performed at baseline, 30 and 90 days after nonsurgical periodontal treatment (NSPT)."
8830,958,"Levels of interleukin IL-1, IL-8 and IL-10 in saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were evaluated by ELISA, as well as the expression of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, (Aa) Tannerella forsythia (Tf), and Treponema denticola (Td), by qPCR."
8831,958,Systemic activity and pSS symptoms were evaluated by ESSDAI and ESSPRI.
8832,958,NSPT resulted in improved periodontal clinical parameters in both SCP and CP groups (p>0.05).
8833,958,"Pg, Aa, and Tf levels decreased after NSPT only in CP patients (p<0.05)."
8834,958,Significantly greater levels of IL-10 in GCF were verified in both SCP and CP groups (p<0.05).
8835,958,SCP patients showed increased salivary flow rates and decreased ESSPRI scores after NSPT.
8836,958,"In conclusion, NSPT in pSS patients resulted in improved clinical and immunological parameters, with no significant effects on microbiological status."
8837,958,pSS patients also showed increased salivary flow and lower ESSPRI scores after therapy.
8838,958,"Therefore, it can be suggested that NSPT may improve the quality of life of pSS patients."
8839,959,CONTEXT: Cathepsin S (CTSS) activity is elevated in Sjgren's Syndrome (SS) patient tears.
8840,959,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate longitudinal expression of tear and tissue CTSS activity relative to other disease indicators in Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice.
8841,959,METHODS: CTSS activity was measured in tears and lacrimal glands (LG) from male 1-6month (M) NOD and 1 and 6M BALB/c mice.
8842,959,"Lymphocytic infiltration was quantified by histopathology, while disease-related proteins (Rab3D, CTSS, collagen 1) were quantified using q-PCR and immunofluorescence."
8843,959,"RESULTS: In NOD LG, lymphocytic infiltration was noted by 2M and established by 3M (p<0.01)."
8844,959,"IFN-, TNF-, and MHC II expression were increased by 2M (p<0.01)."
8845,959,Tear CTSS activity was significantly elevated at 2M (p<0.001) to a maximum of 10.1-fold by 6M (p<0.001).
8846,959,CTSS activity in LG lysates was significantly elevated by 2M (p<0.001) to a maximum of 14-fold by 3M (p<0.001).
8847,959,"CTSS and Rab3D immunofluorescence were significantly increased and decreased maximally in LG acini by 3M and 2M, respectively."
8848,959,"Comparable changes were not detected between 1 and 6M BALB/c mouse LG, although Collagen 1 was decreased by 6M in LG of both strains."
8849,959,"CONCLUSION: Tear CTSS activity is elevated with other early disease indicators, suggesting potential as an early stage biomarker for SS."
8850,960,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of studies exploring potential biomarkers for development, course, and efficacy of treatment of lymphomas in salivary glands of patients with Sjgren's syndrome."
8851,960,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eligible studies were identified through a comprehensive search of two databases, that is, PubMed and EMBASE."
8852,960,"Quality of included articles was assessed with the ""Quality In Prognosis Studies"" (QUIPS) tool."
8853,960,"The ""CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies"" (CHARMS) was used to facilitate data extraction."
8854,960,RESULTS: Fifty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria.
8855,960,Only one study assessed the progression of lymphoma.
8856,960,"Moderate risk of bias was detected in ""outcome measurement,"" ""study participation,"" and ""study confounding"" domains."
8857,960,"Parotid gland enlargement, mixed monoclonal cryoglobulins, and low C4 levels represented strongest predictors of lymphoma development."
8858,960,"The role of histological biomarkers, and specifically germinal centers, remains controversial."
8859,960,Clinical and methodological heterogeneity across studies precluded conduct of a meta-analysis.
8860,960,CONCLUSIONS: Specific biomarkers in combination with clinical manifestations represent potential candidates for advancing precision medicine approaches to lymphoma prediction in patients with Sjgren's syndrome.
8861,960,Current focus has increasingly been on genetic and epigenetic markers as candidate predictors.
8862,960,Predictive accuracy of key biomarker candidates remains to be tested in well-designed prospectively followed Sjgren's syndrome cohorts.
8863,961,OBJECTIVES: To assess changes in salivary epidermal growth factor (EGF) levels within three years and investigate the correlation between these changes and the severity of intraoral manifestations in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
8864,961,METHODS: Twenty-three SS patients (14 primary SS and 9 secondary SS) and 14 controls were followed up for three years.
8865,961,"Salivary EGF concentration was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and intraoral manifestations were evaluated using a short version of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14)."
8866,961,"Changes in salivary flow rate, EGF level, and severity of intraoral manifestations were analyzed, along with associations among them."
8867,961,"RESULTS: The OHIP-14 score significantly increased and the total salivary EGF output significantly decreased after three years in the SS group (10.2  8.8 vs. 12.6  9.2, p = 0.040; 10158.4  9820.9 vs. 8352.8  7813.3 pg/10 min, p = 0.032), though the salivary flow rate did not change."
8868,961,The decrease in total EGF output was especially high in patients with long disease duration and poor oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL).
8869,961,"In patients with poor OHRQoL, the change in total EGF output significantly correlated with the OHIP-14 score (r = - 0.847, p = 0.008)."
8870,961,"However, there was no correlation between the change in salivary flow rate and the OHIP-14 score."
8871,961,CONCLUSIONS: The rapid decrease in salivary EGF level contributes to the progression of intraoral manifestations of SS.
8872,962,"OBJECTIVES: To study the longitudinal development of pulmonary function in patients with primary SS (pSS) and its association with respiratory symptoms, pulmonary radiographic findings and clinical features of pSS."
8873,962,"METHODS: Forty-one pSS patients, previously evaluated by pulmonary function tests (PFTs), were included in the study."
8874,962,"The patients were studied at baseline and follow-up by PFT and at follow-up also by high-resolution CT scan of the lungs, the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and by inflammatory and serological tests."
8875,962,"The PFT results were compared with previously studied population-based controls, standardizing results with regard to gender, age, height, weight and tobacco consumption."
8876,962,RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 11 years.
8877,962,"The pSS patients displayed signs of both obstructive and restrictive lung disease at baseline and at follow-up, and deteriorated in forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)), ratio of FEV(1) to vital capacity and in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide during follow-up."
8878,962,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was diagnosed in 37% of the pSS patients at follow-up.
8879,962,"In pSS patients, respiratory symptoms and radiographic abnormalities were common, although with a poor association with PFT variables."
8880,962,CONCLUSION: The pSS patients showed signs of both obstructive and restrictive pulmonary disease and COPD commonly developed during follow-up.
8881,962,Respiratory symptoms and radiographic abnormalities were common but poorly associated with PFT in pSS patients.
8882,963,"Salivary gland biopsy is a technique broadly applied for the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS), lymphoma accompanying SS, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and other connective tissue disorders."
8883,963,SS has characteristic microscopic findings involving lymphocytic infiltration surrounding the excretory ducts in combination with destruction of acinar tissue.
8884,963,"This article focuses on the main techniques used for taking labial and parotid salivary gland biopsies in the diagnostic workup of SS with respect to their advantages, their postoperative complications, and their usefulness for diagnostic procedures, monitoring disease progression, and treatment evaluation."
8885,964,We report four adult cases of atopic dermatitis (AD) complicated by Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
8886,964,The patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria for AD and SS.
8887,964,All cases showed persistent itchy dry skin and eczematous lesions complicated by sicca symptoms including dry eyes and dry mouth with moderate joint pain.
8888,964,One case manifested annular erythema and another manifested widespread discoid erythema.
8889,964,"To investigate the underlying cause of dry skin in these cases, sweating function was evaluated using a quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART) in which the axon reflex is stimulated by acetylcholine iontophoresis."
8890,964,The sweating latency time was significantly prolonged in eczematous skin of AD and AD/SS compared to normal controls.
8891,964,Axon reflex (AXR) sweat volume was also significantly reduced in AD (normal and eczematous skin) and AD/SS (normal and eczema) compared to normal control.
8892,964,"In contrast, the direct sweat volume of lesional or non-lesional AD skin induced by direct stimulation with acetylcholine was only slightly reduced compared to that in normal controls, but not in SS and lesional skin of AD/SS patients."
8893,964,"These results suggest that the impaired sweat response in AD is attributable to an abnormal sudomotor axon reflex, which is accelerated and modulated when complicated by SS resulting in dry skin in the present cases."
8894,965,Objective: We researched the findings of musculoskeletal ultrasound sonography (MSUS) on primary Sjogren's syndrome in childhood (pSS-C) with articular manifestations.
8895,965,The correlation of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) were investigated to evaluate the usefulness of MSUS on their articular prognosis.
8896,965,Method: The objective patients are pSS-C cases who visited our hospital complaining joint pain and/or joint swelling and for whom MSUS was performed.
8897,965,"Result: Eight patients included 6 female and 2 male, 5RF-positive patients and 3 ACPA- positive patients."
8898,965,The mean age of onset was 11.13.0 years (352 physical joint findings and 284 MSUS findings.
8899,965,"The number of joints found clinical articular manifestations was 58/352 joints, and arthritis detected by MSUS was 30/284 joints)."
8900,965,"In multivariate analysis, the odds ratio of clinical articular manifestations was significant high in RF-positivity (2.9, 95%CI 1.5-6.2)."
8901,965,"The odds ratio of arthritis detected by MSUS in ACPA-positivity was significant high (3.7, 95%CI 1.5-11.6), although odds ratio in RF-positivity had no statistical significance and a similar trend was seen in odds ratios of subclinical arthritis (4.9, 95%CI 1.6-18.0)."
8902,965,Conclusion: It was indicated that MSUS is useful for pSS-C. ACPA-positive pSS-C patients have arthritis and subclinical arthritis more frequently than ACPA-negative patients.
8903,966,Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is complicated by B-cell lymphoma in 5-10% of patients.
8904,966,Several clinical and serological features are proposed as adverse predictors for such complication and define a high risk pSS phenotype.
8905,966,We aimed to explore whether previously described polymorphisms of the B-cell activating factor (BAFF) could be related to pSS-related lymphomagenesis.
8906,966,"Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the BAFF gene (rs1224141, rs12583006, rs9514828, rs1041569 and the rs9514827) were evaluated in 111 low risk pSS patients (type II), 82 high risk/lymphoma patients (type I) and 137 healthy controls (HC) by PCR-based assays."
8907,966,"The classification of pSS patients into types I and II was based on the presence or absence of risk factors or lymphoma development, respectively."
8908,966,Genotype and haplotype analysis was performed for all variants in the pSS groups.
8909,966,"Since the rs1041569 SNP was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the HC group (p<0.001), haplotype analysis was performed in the remaining four out of the five SNPs tested when comparisons with HC individuals were performed."
8910,966,The high risk pSS group was characterized by higher frequency of the minor T allele of the rs9514828 BAFF polymorphism compared to HC.
8911,966,"Compared to the low risk pSS patients but not the HC, the high risk pSS group exhibited lower frequencies of the AA genotype of the rs12583006 polymorphism as well as the TACAC and TACC haplotypes and higher frequency of the TTTC haplotype."
8912,966,The low risk pSS group exhibited higher frequency of the minor A allele and AA genotype of the rs12583006 variant compared to HC.
8913,966,Both pSS groups were characterized by increased frequency of the haplotype TATT and GTTC and decreased frequency of the TTCT when compared to HC.
8914,966,"Taken together, these findings suggest the implication of the host's genetic background in pSS-related lymphomagenesis."
8915,966,The interaction of pSS-related BAFF gene haplotypes together with distinct BAFF genetic variants appears to contribute to this complication.
8916,967,"To describe clinical features and outcomes of seven patients with pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma in the setting of underlying primary Sjgren's syndrome from a single center, we reviewed medical records of consecutive patients with pulmonary MALT lymphoma evaluated at our facility from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2015 for clinical features, laboratory, pathologic and radiographic findings, management, and outcomes."
8917,967,"Out of 13 patients with pulmonary MALT lymphoma, 7 (54 %) met the criteria for Sjgren's syndrome."
8918,967,The mean age at lymphoma diagnosis was 66 years; male-female ratio was 1:6.
8919,967,One-third of patients were asymptomatic at the time lymphoma was discovered.
8920,967,"When symptomatic, patients reported nonspecific pulmonary complaints such as cough and dyspnea."
8921,967,All patients had positive antinuclear antibody and anti-SSA/Ro antibody.
8922,967,Rheumatoid factor was positive in six cases.
8923,967,A monoclonal gammopathy was present in three patients; the remaining four had polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.
8924,967,"The radiologic, morphologic, and immunohistochemical features of primary Sjgren's syndrome-associated pulmonary MALT lymphomas did not differ significantly from pulmonary MALT lymphoma cases in general."
8925,967,All treatment modalities used resulted in complete and sustained response.
8926,967,One patient died 11 years after initial diagnosis with no lymphoma but of another cause.
8927,967,The remaining six patients are still alive and disease-free to date.
8928,967,The present series confirms the favorable course of pulmonary MALT lymphoma in Sjgren's patients.
8929,967,The overall imaging and pathologic features are in accordance with pulmonary MALT lymphoma not associated with primary Sjgren's syndrome.
8930,967,"Further studies should be carried out in order to better understand pulmonary MALT lymphomagenesis, treatment, and outcomes in Sjgren's patients."
8931,968,"Aquaporin (AQP)-5 has been shown to be expressed in the secretory parts of mouse, rat and horse sweat glands."
8932,968,"However, the precise localization of AQP-5 in normal and diseased human skin has not been fully determined."
8933,968,The aim of the present study was to further clarify the immunolocalization of AQP-5 in normal human skin and hypohidrotic skin diseases.
8934,968,"Normal human scalp skin and biopsies from skin affected by hypohidrotic diseases were analyzed for AQP-5 and/or dermcidin expression by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and/or immunoelectronmicroscopy."
8935,968,"AQP-5 was expressed on the apical and basolateral plasma membranes of the clear cells in eccrine sweat coils, but not in ductal components or apocrine glands."
8936,968,"Numbers of AQP-5-positive coils in the secretory part of eccrine sweat glands were decreased in Sjgren's syndrome, but not in skin affected by idiopathic segmental anhidrosis or idiopathic pure sudomotor failure."
8937,968,"AQP-5 was mostly localized to the plasma membranes of clear cells in the secretory coils of eccrine sweat glands, suggesting that it plays a role in producing the primary sweat fluid."
8938,969,Organ-specific and systemic autoimmune diseases share numerous features and often coexist in the same patient.
8939,969,Autoimmune cholangitis/primary biliary cirrhosis and Sjogren syndrome represent paradigmatic examples of the common grounds of different autoimmunity phenotypes based on similarities in clinical manifestations and immunopathogenesis.
8940,969,"In fact, primary biliary cirrhosis and Sjogren's syndrome have both been coined as an autoimmune epithelitis in which apoptosis may be in both cases the key element to explain the organ-specific immune-mediated injury against the biliary and exocrine gland epithelia, respectively."
8941,969,"Further, growing evidence supports in both diseases the view that B cells, T cytotoxic cells, and T helper cells are involved in chronic inflammation, likely via the altered expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines."
8942,969,The presence of estrogen receptors on the biliary and exocrine gland epithelia has been advocated as a key to the female predominance encountered in primary biliary cirrhosis and Sjogren's syndrome.
8943,969,"Sadly, despite available data, therapeutic approaches remain largely unsatisfactory and recent studies with mechanistic approaches (as in the case of B cell depletion with rituximab) have been of partial benefit only."
8944,969,"Future studies should focus on new molecular tools (single-cell transcriptomics, microRNA, epigenetics) to provide unique insights into common mechanisms."
8945,970,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of non-pharmacological interventions for primary SS (pSS) on outcomes falling within the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health domains.
8946,970,METHODS: We searched the following databases from inception to September 2014: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; Medline; Embase; PsychINFO; CINAHL; and clinical trials registers.
8947,970,We included randomized controlled trials of any non-pharmacological intervention.
8948,970,Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts against the inclusion/exclusion criteria and independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.
8949,970,"RESULTS: A total of 1463 studies were identified, from which 17 full text articles were screened and 5 studies were included in the review; a total of 130 participants were randomized."
8950,970,"The included studies investigated the effectiveness of an oral lubricating device for dry mouth, acupuncture for dry mouth, lacrimal punctum plugs for dry eyes and psychodynamic group therapy for coping with symptoms."
8951,970,"Overall, the studies were of low quality and at high risk of bias."
8952,970,"Although one study showed punctum plugs to improve dry eyes, the sample size was relatively small."
8953,970,CONCLUSION: Further high-quality studies to evaluate non-pharmacological interventions for PSS are needed.
8954,971,"OBJECTIVE: To explore changes in the phenotypic features of Sjgren's syndrome (SS), and in SS status among participants in the Sjgren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) registry over a 2-3-year interval."
8955,971,"METHODS: All participants in the SICCA registry who were found to have any objective measures of salivary hypofunction, dry eye, focal lymphocytic sialadenitis in minor salivary gland biopsy, or anti-SSA/SSB antibodies were recalled over a window of 2 to 3 years after their baseline examinations to repeat all clinical examinations and specimen collections to determine whether there was any change in phenotypic features and in SS status."
8956,971,"RESULTS: As of September 15, 2013, a total of 3,514 participants had enrolled in SICCA, and among 3,310 eligible, 771 presented for a followup visit."
8957,971,"Among participants found to have SS using the 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria, 93% again met the criteria after 2 to 3 years, and this proportion was 89% when using the 2016 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria."
8958,971,"Among those who did not meet ACR or ACR/EULAR criteria at baseline, 9% and 8%, respectively, had progressed and met them at followup."
8959,971,"Those with hypergammaglobulinemia and hypocomplementemia at study entry were, respectively, 4 and 6 times more likely to progress to SS by ACR criteria than those without these characteristics (95% confidence interval 1.5-10.1 and 1.8-20.4, respectively)."
8960,971,"CONCLUSION: While there was stability over a 2-3-year period of both individual phenotypic features of SS and of SS status, hypergammaglobulinemia and hypocomplementemia at study entry were predictive of progression to SS."
8961,972,A 42-year-old woman who had a history of Sjgren's syndrome was admitted to our hospital because of a mass lesion in the left cervical region.
8962,972,A hard tumor in the left lobe and a smaller mass in the central area was detected by ultrasonography and computed tomography.
8963,972,Subtotal thyroidectomy with lymph node dissection was performed.
8964,972,The central mass was minimal thyroid carcinoma.
8965,972,The minimal thyroid carcinoma was discovered accidentally during therapy for Sjgren's syndrome.
8966,972,"Because the symptoms decreased, surgery of the thyroid carcinoma could be performed."
8967,972,"When it was aggravated, it was thought to be diagnosed carefully."
8968,973,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the exocrine glands that results in multiple organs and systems damage.
8969,973,Renal injury affects 0.3%-27.0% patients.
8970,973,The most frequent form of nephropathy in pSS is tubulointerstitial nephritis.
8971,973,The main clinical manifestation is renal tubular acidosis.
8972,973,"The renal prognosis in patients with pSS is usually favorable, but renal failure may occur."
8973,973,"At present, it still lacks of strict consensus or guideline for the treatment."
8974,974,A 27-year-old woman presented with persistent dryness of the mouth and eyes.
8975,974,She presented with permanent photodistributed rash involving the face and distal extremities.
8976,974,Laboratory tests showed positive Sjgren's syndrome (SS)-A and SS-B antibodies.
8977,974,Histological examination of minor salivary gland biopsy revealed inflammatory infiltration grade 4 according to Chisholm's classification.
8978,974,"Skin biopsy showed acanthosis, hyperkeratosis in the epidermis and little inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis."
8979,974,There was an infiltration of CD4 T lymphocytes in the dermis.
8980,974,"Based on the characteristics of the dermatitis and on a rapid response to niacin replacement, the diagnosis of pellagra was carried out."
8981,974,A complete resolution of the dermatological signs was obtained within 2months.
8982,974,"To the best of our knowledge, the association between primary SS and pellagra has never been reported."
8983,974,We emphasise the possible mechanisms of this association.
8984,975,Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP antibody) is very useful for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is associated with articular erosions.
8985,975,The specificity of anti-CCP antibody in the diagnosis of RA has been reported to be about 95 %.
8986,975,"Because of its higher specificity in RA, we assessed the clinical features of primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) who were positive for anti-CCP antibody."
8987,975,We assessed the clinical features of 405 pSS patients.
8988,975,"After 60 (range 7-98) months, 23 (5.6 %) patients previously diagnosed with pSS had progressed to RA."
8989,975,"Comparing the anti-CCP positive group with the negative group, laboratory test results for anti-CCP titer and rheumatoid factor positivity with respect to clinical outcome and progression to RA, arthralgia and arthritis were significantly different."
8990,975,Multivariate regression analysis also showed that anti-CCP antibody titer was independently associated with progression to RA.
8991,975,The odds ratio of anti-CCP positivity in terms of progression to RA was 2.5 (95 % CI 1.7-3.7).
8992,975,Testing for anti-CCP antibody in pSS patients with arthritis may allow for the prediction of progression to RA.
8993,976,"Sjgren's syndrome is a systemic inflammatory-rheumatic disorder of hitherto unknown origin and, hence, adequate therapy options are not available in most cases."
8994,976,Treatment of sicca symptoms in Sjgren's patients is primarily symptomatic.
8995,976,"Glucocorticoids, NSAIDs and/or immunosuppressive drugs may be used for the treatment of extraglandular manifestations or complications."
8996,976,"Although there have been few clinical studies to date, new insights into the pathogenesis of this disorder may permit novel therapeutic strategies."
8997,976,Targeting B-cell candidates as a new therapeutic option in this entity has shown promising results.
8998,976,"B-cell-depletion using Rituximab has been tested in initial clinical trials for the treatment of Sjgren patients, both with and without associated B-cell non-Hodgkin-lymphoma; however, further studies as well as reliable outcome criteria are needed."
8999,976,Further therapeutic options are currently in development or early clinical testing.
9000,977,"Rapid point-of-care, antibody-based testing is not currently available for the diagnosis of most autoimmune and infectious diseases."
9001,977,"Here we report a simple, robust and ultrafast fluid-phase immunocapture method for clinical measurements of antibody levels."
9002,977,This method employs neodymium magnetic sticks that capture protein A/G-coated paramagnetic beads bound to antibody-luciferase-labeled antigen complexes.
9003,977,"We demonstrate the ability to effectively measure specific antibody levels in serum samples from patients with varied infectious or autoimmune disorders, and in the case of Sjgren's syndrome directly in saliva, requiring about a minute per assay."
9004,977,We also show the feasibility of coupling this method with a hand-held luminometer for portable testing.
9005,977,Our method offers the potential to quickly diagnose a multitude of autoimmune and infectious diseases in point-of-care settings.
9006,978,OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in routine practice is largely a clinical one and requires a high index of suspicion by the treating physician.
9007,978,This great dependence on clinical judgment frequently leads to delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis.
9008,978,Tear protein profiles have been proposed as simple and reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of SS.
9009,978,"Given that cathepsin S activity is increased in the lacrimal glands and tears of NOD mice (a murine model of SS), the aim of this study was to explore the clinical utility of using tear cathepsin S (CTSS) activity as a biomarker for SS."
9010,978,METHODS: A method to measure CTSS activity in tears eluted from Schirmer's test strips was developed and validated.
9011,978,"Schirmer's tests were performed and CTSS activity measurements were obtained in 278 female subjects, including 73 with SS, 79 with rheumatoid arthritis, 40 with systemic lupus erythematosus, 10 with blepharitis, 31 with nonspecific dry eye disease, and 12 with other autoimmune diseases, as well as 33 healthy control subjects."
9012,978,"RESULTS: The median tear CTSS activity in patients with SS was 4.1-fold higher than that in patients with other autoimmune diseases, 2.1-fold higher than that in patients with nonspecific dry eye disease, and 41.1-fold higher than that in healthy control subjects."
9013,978,"Tear CTSS levels were equally elevated in patients with primary SS and those with secondary SS, independent of the Schirmer's test strip values or the levels of circulating anti-SSA or anti-SSB antibodies."
9014,978,CONCLUSION: Markedly high levels of tear CTSS activity are suggestive of SS.
9015,978,"CTSS activity in tears can be measured in a simple, quick, economical, and noninvasive manner and may serve as a novel biomarker for autoimmune dacryoadenitis during the diagnostic evaluation for SS."
9016,979,Sjogren's syndrome (SjS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by immune cell infiltration and progressive injury to the salivary and lacrimal glands.
9017,979,"As a consequence, patients with SjS develop xerostomia (dry mouth) and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes)."
9018,979,"SjS is the third most common rheumatic autoimmune disorder, affecting 4 million Americans with over 90% of patients being female."
9019,979,"Current diagnostic criteria for SjS frequently utilize histological examinations of minor salivary glands for immune cell foci, serology for autoantibodies, and dry eye evaluation by corneal or conjunctival staining."
9020,979,"SjS can be classified as primary or secondary SjS, depending on whether it occurs alone or in association with other systemic rheumatic conditions, respectively."
9021,979,"Clinical manifestations typically become apparent when the disease is relatively advanced in SjS patients, which poses a challenge for early diagnosis and treatment of SjS."
9022,979,"Therefore, SjS mouse models, because of their close resemblance to the human SjS, have been extremely valuable to identify early disease markers and to investigate underlying biological and immunological dysregulations."
9023,979,"However, it is important to bear in mind that no single mouse model has duplicated all aspects of SjS pathogenesis and clinical features, mainly due to the multifactorial etiology of SjS that includes numerous susceptibility genes and environmental factors."
9024,979,"As such, various mouse models have been developed in the field to try to recapitulate SjS."
9025,979,"In this review, we focus on recent mouse models of primary SjS xerostomia and describe them under three categories of spontaneous, genetically engineered, and experimentally induced models."
9026,979,"In addition, we discuss future perspectives highlighting pros and cons of utilizing mouse models and current demands for improved models."
9027,980,There are many etiologic factors to consider in a patient who presents with symptoms or sensations of a sore burning mouth.
9028,980,"These range from local causes within the oral cavity to underlying systemic disease, including psychologic factors."
9029,980,This paper aims to describe the different clinical presentations and to outline a systematic approach to the evaluation and management of such patients.
9030,980,"The clinician will be directed to the relevant diagnosis by following the traditional medical model of taking a focused history, performing a thorough clinical examination, considering the potential differential diagnoses, and requesting pertinent and appropriate investigations."
9031,980,The various differential diagnoses and broad treatment options will also be discussed and outlined.
9032,980,"This paper will not, however, discuss burning mouth syndrome (oral dysesthesia), which is a diagnosis of exclusion, whereby the oral mucosa is clinically normal and there are no identifiable medical or dental causes to account for the patient's symptoms."
9033,981,OBJECTIVES: In primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) dryness of eye and mouth is the cardinal referred symptom.
9034,981,Assessing the rate of activity and damage in the salivary glands of pSS patients is essential to improve disease management.
9035,981,"Up to now, a differentiation of activity and damage ultrasonographic (US) lesions is an open issue."
9036,981,The aim of this preliminary study was to identify US lesions which better correlate with loss of function of salivary glands in pSS.
9037,981,"METHODS: Salivary glands ultrasonography of consecutive patients with established pSS, fulfilling AECG and ACR/EULAR criteria was performed."
9038,981,The association between sialometry and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) oral dryness and SGUS lesions was assessed trough univariate and multivariate analysis.
9039,981,"RESULTS: In 75 established pSS patients, mean disease duration 12.47.2 years, the hyperechoic bands of parotid gland (PG) and submandibular gland (SMG) were significantly associated with sialometry (p<0.001) and VAS oral dryness (PG p=0.002, SMG p<0.001)."
9040,981,"The global glandular involvement (scored according to De Vita et al., 1992) was associated with sialometry (PG p=0.025, SMG p<0.001) and with VAS oral sicca (PG p=0.015, SMG p<0.001)."
9041,981,The multivariate analysis selected the hyperechoic bands of PG and SMG as the variables independently associated with sialometry and the hyperechoic bands and the homogeneity in the SMG as associated with VAS oral dryness.
9042,981,"CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that salivary impairment in pSS, as objectively evaluated by sialometry, could be mainly associated with damage (i.e., hyperechoic bands) in established pSS."
9043,981,Additional follow-up studies and improved scoring tools are needed.
9044,982,We report a case of a 67 year-old man with bilateral sensory ataxia of the upper extremities.
9045,982,He was diagnosed as having ANCA-related angitis and Sjgren syndrome at age 60.
9046,982,"On admission to our hospital at age 67, he presented with severe sensory ataxia in his upper extremities, while his lower extremity neurological symptoms were limited to the absence of tendon reflexes."
9047,982,Cervical MRI showed an increased T2 signal intensity in an area limited to the bilateral cuneate fasciculus.
9048,982,Serum levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid were normal.
9049,982,"Plasma homocysteine, serum and urine methylmalonic acid were also normal."
9050,982,Eight-week intramuscular administration of vitamin B12 did not improve either his disorder or the MRI findings.
9051,982,"His sensory ataxia might be attributed to Sjgren syndrome-associated ganglionopathy at the cervical level, and the MRI findings might reflect centripetal Wallerian degeneration in the cuneate fasciculus."
9052,982,"Gracilis fasciculus are well-known as vulnerable regions in Sjgren-associated myelopathy, whereas cervical myelopathy, limited to cuneate fascicules, can emerge as Sjgren-associated disorders."
9053,983,OBJECTIVES: Major salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) is a suitable diagnostic tool in Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
9054,983,"We aimed to determine the more representative gland, projection and format most applicable for reproducible image analysis."
9055,983,METHODS: One investigator performed SGUS in patients with SS.
9056,983,Parotid and submandibular glands were examined in longitudinal and transverse planes and evaluated bedside using a simplified scoring system (0-3).
9057,983,"Longitudinal and transverse images and videos of all glands were stored and later evaluated/graded by three investigators, at two time-points."
9058,983,Agreement was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
9059,983,RESULTS: The ICC for static image and video scoring compared to bedside evaluation ranged from 0.131 to 0.882.
9060,983,"Average ICC for longitudinal/transverse image was 0.667/0.662, and 0.683/0.510 for longitudinal/transverse video."
9061,983,Interobserver reliability was good to excellent (0.81-0.94).
9062,983,Intraobserver reliability scores ranged from fair to excellent (0.46-0.96).
9063,983,The correlation between image and video evaluations of all modalities and examiners was good to excellent (0.614-0.904).
9064,983,The best mean ICC was found for the longitudinal projection of the left parotid gland (0.861) and the lowest mean ICC was for the transverse projection of the left submandibular gland (0.66).
9065,983,"CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates a trend favouring longitudinal video of the parotid gland as preferred projection, gland and storage format."
9066,984,"Background: Autoimmune connective tissue diseases (ACTDs) are a broad range of diseases featured by immune dysregulation, and often have multisystem involvement with prominent skin manifestations."
9067,984,"Pruritus is one of the most common symptoms in these diseases, with significant impact on the quality of life of patients."
9068,984,"Objective: To characterize the frequency, location, severity, and timing relative to disease onset of pruritus in different ACTDs."
9069,984,Methods: A chart review of all patients seen in the Rheumatology-Dermatology clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital.
9070,984,"Results: Itch was a troubling symptom in 83% of dermatomyositis (DM), 61% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 59% of Sjogren syndrome (SJO), 22% of systemic sclerosis (SSc), and 60% of mixed connective tissue disease."
9071,984,"In DM and SLE, itch paralleled the course of inflammatory skin manifestations in 83% and 45%, respectively."
9072,984,Itch in DM is more intense and more treatment resistant in 12% vs 1% in SLE.
9073,984,"In contrast, itch in SSc and SJO tended to occur later in the disease course, 86% vs 42%, respectively."
9074,984,Conclusion: Itch is common in all ACTDs and often under-evaluated and under treated.
9075,984,Pruritus is more common and more severe in DM than in SLE.
9076,984,"Treatment of pruritus in ACTDs can be challenging, and sometimes multi-modal therapy is warranted."

9079,985,Patients with salivary gland disease present with certain objective and/or subjective signs.
9080,985,"An accurate diagnosis for these patients requires a range of techniques that includes the organized integration of information derived from their history, clinical examination, imaging, serology, and histopathology."
9081,985,"This article highlights the signs and symptoms of the salivary gland disorders seen in the Salivary Gland Center, and emphasizes the methodology used to achieve a definitive diagnosis and therapy."
9082,986,OBJECTIVES: Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells play a role in regulating the function of autoreactive B cells before their entry into germinal centres.
9083,986,Absence and/or reduction of iNKT cells have been demonstrated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) together with an increase of autoreactive B cell activity.
9084,986,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease in which lymphocyte infiltration and organisation in lymphoid structures of inflamed salivary glands occurs.
9085,986,The aim of the study was to investigate the percentage and function of iNKT in the salivary glands and peripheral blood of patients with pSS.
9086,986,METHODS: Minor salivary gland biopsies were obtained from patients with pSS and with non-specific chronic sialoadenitis (nSS).
9087,986,"Flow cytometry analysis of CD1d/-GalactosylCeramide (-GalCer) tetramer positive cells, producing IFN- and IL-17, and quantitative gene expression analysis by TaqMan real-time PCR for V24 were performed on salivary glands biopsies and peripheral blood samples obtained from patients and controls."
9088,986,Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis for autoreactive B lymphocytes and ELISA for anti-SSA antibodies (Ab) detection were also performed.
9089,986,RESULTS: An increase of iNKT was detected ex vivo in peripheral blood of pSS patients; after -GalCer stimulation this subset produce IL-17 and IFN-iNKT were undetectable in the salivary glands of pSS patients and anti-SSA specific B cells were found in target tissue.
9090,986,Invariant NKT cells were able to inhibit autoantibody production by B cells obtained from salivary glands of pSS.
9091,986,CONCLUSIONS: Impaired iNKT migration to inflamed sites might induce the activation of autoreactive B cells specific for SSA-antigen in salivary glands of pSS patients.
9092,987,BACKGROUND: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is one of the most common autoimmune disorders leading to exocrine gland dysfunction.
9093,987,Both immune-dependent processes - like Type I Interferon (IFN) signaling and immune-independent processes - such as calcium signaling in epithelial cells - contribute to disease pathophysiology.
9094,987,"However, a mechanistic link between these processes has not been demonstrated."
9095,987,METHODS: Primary human salivary gland cells were used to evaluate the differential expression of miRNAs with smRNA-seq in primary epithelial cells culture and digital PCR was conducted in SS human salivary glands (SG) biopsies to verify the results.
9096,987,With siRNA screening and pull-down assays to establish the role of miRNA in IFN activation.
9097,987,FINDINGS: Activation of IFN- by miR-1248 is through the direct association with both RIG-I and AGO2.
9098,987,Further functional studies establish a unique dual functional role of miR-1248 in phSG cells: i) activation of the RIG-I pathway by acting as ligand of this sensor leading to IFN production and ii) regulation of the expression of mRNAs through the canonical microRNA function.
9099,987,"Importantly, ITPR3, a key component of calcium signaling in epithelial cells, that has previously shown to be downregulated in SS SG, was directly targeted and downregulated by miR-1248, inducing the same functional calcium signaling changes as observed in SS SGs."
9100,987,"INTERPRETATION: Identification of the first endogenous mammalian microRNA that binds to RIG-I inducing IFN production but also demonstrate a novel pathophysiological underlying mechanism in which miR-1248 overexpression links two major pathways associated with SS, namely activation of IFN production with modulation of calcium signaling."
9101,987,"Together, these findings suggest a unifying hypothesis for the immune-independent and -dependent processes contributing to the pathogenesis of SS."
9102,987,"FUND: This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)."
9103,988,OBJECTIVE: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) may occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
9104,988,"We sought to determine whether the presence of SS in a large cohort of patients with SLE defines a subset with distinctive sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory features."
9105,988,"METHODS: The Johns Hopkins Lupus Cohort was divided into 2 groups, based on the presence or absence of SS, defined by the presence of an objective measure of sicca or an abnormal minor salivary gland biopsy in a patient with sicca symptoms."
9106,988,"These groups were compared with regard to sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory features."
9107,988,"Multivariable logistic regression was then performed to adjust the findings for potential sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory confounders."
9108,988,"RESULTS: The 259 patients with SS (14% of the cohort), when compared with the 1531 patients without SS, were older at the time of SLE diagnosis and were more commonly women and white."
9109,988,"Photosensitivity, oral ulcers, Raynaud's phenomenon, anti-Ro antibodies, and anti-La antibodies had a significant positive association while renal disease, anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies, and anti-dsDNA antibodies had a negative association with the presence of SS after adjustment for age (at last cohort visit), gender, ethnicity, and anti-Ro antibodies."
9110,988,The older age at diagnosis of SLE among the patients with SS did not remain a significant finding after adjustment for the age of the patient at last cohort visit.
9111,988,"CONCLUSION: The subset of patients with SLE and SS has a distinct clinical and laboratory phenotype, with a higher frequency of older white women with photosensitivity, oral ulcers, Raynaud's phenomenon, anti-Ro antibodies, and anti-La antibodies and a lower frequency of renal disease, anti-dsDNA antibodies, and anti-RNP antibodies."
9112,989,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterised by xerostomia and xerophthalmia.
9113,989,"In at least one-third of patients, the disease may be complicated by extraglandular involvement."
9114,989,"Due to the lack of evidence-based recommendations, current therapeutic options for pSS are mainly empirical, often reflecting their use in other autoimmune diseases."
9115,989,"Nevertheless, recent advances in the understanding of pathogenic pathways in pSS encourage the belief that blocking them may be of value in the treatment of the disease."
9116,989,"Despite failing to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials, because of the well-established role of B-lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of pSS, rituximab has been the most frequently used to date, but with much less success than in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis and lupus."
9117,989,"However, in the last few years a number of other biologics have been developed and are under investigation."
9118,989,The aim of this article is to review the use of biologic therapies in pSS.
9119,990,OBJECTIVE: The transient increase of the cytoplasmic free calcium level plays a key role in the process of lymphocyte activation.
9120,990,Kv1.3 and IKCa1 potassium channels are important regulators of the maintenance of calcium influx and present a possible target for selective immunomodulation.
9121,990,DESIGN: Case-control study.
9122,990,SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We took peripheral blood samples from 8 healthy individuals and 15 primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients.
9123,990,We evaluated calcium influx kinetics following activation in peripheral T lymphocytes.
9124,990,"We also assessed the sensitivity of T lymphocytes to specific inhibition of the Kv1.3 and IKCa1 potassium channels, and the Kv1.3 channel expression."
9125,990,RESULTS: The basal cytoplasmatic calcium levels were lower in both Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes in pSS compared to controls.
9126,990,"The peak of calcium influx in lymphocytes isolated from pSS patients is reached later, indicating that they respond more slowly to stimulation compared to controls."
9127,990,"In healthy individuals, the inhibition of the IKCa1 channel decreased calcium influx in Th2 and CD4 cells to a lower extent than in Th1 and CD8 cells."
9128,990,"On the contrary, the inhibition of Kv1.3 channels resulted in a larger decrease of calcium entry in Th2 and CD4 than in Th1 and CD8 cells."
9129,990,"In the pSS group, neither of the inhibitors induced alteration in calcium influx."
9130,990,"Expression of Kv1.3 channels on CD4, Th2 and CD8 lymphocytes in pSS was significantly higher compared to controls."
9131,990,CONCLUSION: The altered expression and specific inhibition of potassium channels seem to be related to altered calcium influx kinetics in pSS which distinguish pSS either from healthy controls or other systemic autoimmune diseases.
9132,991,"OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the reliability and correlation of sialography, salivary gland biopsy, and ultrasonography for Sjgren syndrome (SS) and evaluated the usefulness of ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool for SS compared with sialography and histopathology."
9133,991,"STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-three patients who underwent sialography, ultrasonography, and salivary gland biopsy were included in this study."
9134,991,The study evaluated the diagnostic reliability and correlation of each kind of examination with SS.
9135,991,"RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in the sensitivities of sialography and histopathology, in the specificities of sialography and ultrasonography, and in the accuracies of sialography and both ultrasonography and histopathology."
9136,991,The correlation coefficient (r) between sialography and ultrasonography was significantly higher than the others and indicated a good correlation.
9137,991,"CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography can be used as a diagnostic tool for SS, with its advantage of noninvasiveness and ease of use."
9138,992,Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a very rare syndrome with a mortality up to 95% of cases if not treated.
9139,992,It is characterised by an excessive activation of the immune system that leads to a disproportionate and destructive inflammatory response.
9140,992,"The high mortality rates are in part due to a delay in the diagnosis, and therefore clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion."
9141,992,"When the treatment is started early, the survival rate reaches around 55% of cases."
9142,992,"HLH usually presents with persistent fever, pancytopenia, and organomegaly and is associated with very high levels of serum ferritin."
9143,992,"In this manuscript, we present the case of a patient with primary Sjgren's syndrome who developed HLH after an acute infection by Cytomegalovirus."
9144,992,"We will describe and discuss the pathogenesis, differential diagnosis and a pragmatic approach to the treatment for this critically important and, when diagnosed early, potentially curable syndrome."
9145,993,Sjgren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and hypofunction of salivary and lacrimal glands.
9146,993,"This loss of salivary function leads to oral dryness, impaired swallowing and speech, and increased infection and is associated with other autoimmune diseases and an increased risk of certain cancers."
9147,993,"Despite the implications of this prevalent disease, diagnosis currently takes years, partly due to the diversity in patient presentation."
9148,993,"Saliva is a complicated biological fluid with major constituents, including heavily glycosylated mucins MUC5B and MUC7, important for its viscoelastic and hydrating and lubricating properties."
9149,993,"This study investigated Sjgren's patient's perception of dryness (bother index questionnaires) along with the rheological, protein composition, and glycan analysis of whole mouth saliva and the saliva on the mucosal surface (residual mucosal saliva) to understand the properties that most affect patient wellbeing."
9150,993,"Sjgren's patients exhibited a statistically significant reduction in residual mucosal saliva, salivary flow rate, and extensional rheology, spinnbarkeit (stringiness)."
9151,993,"Although the concentration of mucins MUC5B and MUC7 were similar between patients and controls, a comparison of protein Western blotting and glycan staining identified a reduction in mucin glycosylation in Sjgren's, particularly on MUC7."
9152,993,"LC-MS/MS analysis of O-glycans released from MUC7 by -elimination revealed that although patients had an increase in core 1 sulfation, the even larger reduction in sialylation resulted in a global decline of charged glycans."
9153,993,"This was primarily due to the loss of the extended core 2 disialylated structure, with and without fucosylation."
9154,993,"A decrease in the extended, fucosylated core 2 disialylated structure on MUC7, residual mucosal wetness, and whole mouth saliva flow rate appeared to have a negative and cumulative effect on the perception of oral dryness."
9155,993,The observed changes in MUC7 glycosylation could be a potential diagnostic tool for saliva quality and taken into consideration for future therapies for this multifactorial syndrome.
9156,994,PURPOSE: To present patient reported changes in oral symptoms in response to an open-label product trial conducted in patients self-identifying as having Sjgren's syndrome.
9157,994,"METHODS: A survey was conducted in conjunction with the Sjgren's Syndrome Foundation and 151 foundation members completed a survey rating their common oral symptoms, based upon the Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey before and after use of the trial products, including rinse, -lozenges, gel, and spray."
9158,994,RESULTS: Subjects reported multiple oral symptoms with the highest rated symptoms involving dry mouth with 80% of symptoms showing statistically significant reduction from pre- to posttest.
9159,994,The largest symptom reductions were in dry mouth symptoms and dietary problems.
9160,994,CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of dry mouth were improved with use of MedActive products.
9161,994,Increased ease of taking oral medications also was reported.
9162,994,Improvement in mouth/throat pain was noted.
9163,994,Subjects reported considerable effect of the test product upon dry mouth and oral symptoms.
9164,995,"Annular erythema has been recognized to be a specific, cutaneous manifestation associated with Sjgren's syndrome."
9165,995,"Based on a search of the literature up to 2007, annular erythema with Sjgren's syndrome (AESS) preferentially occurs in Asian but not in Western populations."
9166,995,"However, the precise clinical course and standard regimen for the management of AESS have remained obscure, primarily because of its rare occurrence in Western populations and the fact that most Asian cases are isolated reports."
9167,995,"In this study, 28 cases of AESS from our department and 92 cases distilled from the literature were enrolled in a retrospective study to evaluate the clinical characteristics and most desirable management of this skin manifestation in Sjgren's syndrome."
9168,995,We found that 75% of all cases with AESS were positive for both anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies.
9169,995,"Multiple therapeutic options are available to treat AESS, including oral steroids."
9170,995,Several anti-malaria drugs or tacrolimus ointment have also been reported to be effective against AESS.
9171,995,"AESS is a distinct clinical entity, and a small dose of prednisolone (approx."
9172,995,"10 mg) is sufficient to control diseases activity, except in some cases with systemic manifestations, and this treatment has a more rapid clinical effect than topical steroids."
9173,996,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of anti--fodrin in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
9174,996,"METHODS: By internet retrieval, all anti--fodrin data were considered."
9175,996,This analysis included studies showing anti--fodrin (IgA or IgG) results in patients with SS and the control group with other autoimmune diseases.
9176,996,The qualities of the involved studies were assessed by QUADAS.
9177,996,"The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the IgA and IgG were calculated, respectively."
9178,996,"Finally, stratified analysis was performed according to the possible heterogeneity sources."
9179,996,RESULTS: Twenty-three studies including seven Chinese and sixteen English reports met the entry criteria.
9180,996,"The pooled sensitivity and specificity of all the involved studies anti--fodrin were 39.3% and 83%, respectively."
9181,996,"In detail, the pooled sensitivity was 38% in IgG subtype and 41.9% in IgA subtype while the specificity was 83.1% in IgG subtype and 82.8% in IgA subtype."
9182,996,CONCLUSION: The anti--fodrin showed moderate accuracy for the diagnosis of SS with high specificity and relative low sensitivity.
9183,997,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and pattern of cognitive dysfunction observed in primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS) and to examine the relationships between cognitive abilities, depression, fatigue, and quality of life."
9184,997,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two subjects with PSS were compared with 19 healthy controls on comprehensive neuropsychological, depression, fatigue, health state, and daily-life activities tests."
9185,997,"RESULTS: There was low performance in Clock Drawing, COWAT, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), Colorless Word Reading (Stroop1) and Recognizing Colors (Stroop2) Patterns of STROOP test, SDLT, Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), immediate and long-term verbal memory, Benton Judgment of Line Orientation Test (BJLOT), and in all the patterns of RCFT in PSS patients compared to the healthy control group (p<.05)."
9186,997,"It was observed an increased depression frequency and fatigue severity, impairment in health condition, and a decreased quality of life in PSS cases compared to the healthy controls (p<.05)."
9187,997,"All the depression, fatigue severity, and quality of life tests showed a significant positive correlation with each other (p<.05)."
9188,997,"A significant negative correlation between Clock Drawing and SF-36-BP (p=.031, r=-.382) and SF-36-GH (p=.027, r=-.392) was observed."
9189,997,"CONCLUSIONS: Clock Drawing, PASAT, and AVLT are very useful tests to determine the subclinical and clinical cognitive dysfunction to evaluate attention, information processing speed, executive functions, and short-term and long-term verbal memory in PSS patients."
9190,997,Depression and fatigue may not affect the neuropsychological tests performance.
9191,998,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presenting as diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare association; there is a case report of neurogenic DI in patients of SLE; however, SLE and nephrogenic DI has not been reported in literature."
9192,998,We present a case of SLE presenting as nephrogenic DI.
9193,998,We report a case who presented with DI (nephrogenic) and fulfilled criteria for SLE and Sjgren's syndrome with renal tubular acidosis.
9194,999,OBJECTIVES: Overt renal disease in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) manifests as interstitial nephritis and glomerulonephritis.
9195,999,This single centre study aims to describe the natural history and treatment outcome of renal disease in pSS.
9196,999,"METHODS: pSS patients with renal disease were identified, and clinical features, renal biopsy findings, treatment details and renal outcome were recorded."
9197,999,"RESULTS: Of the 20 pSS patients with renal disease, 14 had interstitial nephritis (IN), 3 had glomerulonephritis (GN) and 3 had both entities."
9198,999,"In the IN group, 3 patients presented with chronic kidney disease (CKD), 4 with renal tubular acidosis (RTA), 2 with symptomatic hypokalaemia, 4 with renal colic and 1 with haematuria/proteinuria."
9199,999,"Eight of 14 patients with IN received systemic immunosuppression (IS) during renal disease course and in 6 patients no beneficial effect was observed on renal function, hypokalaemia and RTA."
9200,999,Six of 14 IN patients developed CKD while 5 of them preserved normal renal function during follow-up.
9201,999,"In the GN group, 2 patients presented with CKD, 3 with proteinuria/haematuria and 1 with nephrotic proteinuria."
9202,999,"GN renal biopsy findings revealed membranoproliferative (MPGN) (n=3), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (n=1) and fibrillary glomerulopathy (n=1)."
9203,999,All 3 MPGN patients had cryoglobulinaemia and in 1 patient cryoglobulinaemic MPGN was clinically diagnosed.
9204,999,"All GN patients were treated with immunosuppressive therapy, with stabilisation or improvement of renal function in the 4 cryoglobulinaemia-associated GN patients only."
9205,999,CONCLUSIONS: Interstitial nephritis follows a slow course and does not improve with systemic immunosuppression while GN has a favourable treatment response in those with MPGN pathology.
9206,1000,"In order to evaluate autoantibody to SP-1 as an early biomarker in pSS, we investigated autoantibody to SP-1 in Chinese patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
9207,1000,"Autoantibodies to SP-1 are significantly increased in pSS patients compared to RA patients, SLE patients, and healthy people without secondary SS."
9208,1000,"The presence of anti SP-1 antibodies was negatively correlated with the focus score (FS), RF, and salivary gland function."
9209,1000,"It was positively correlated with FS=0, RF20, and normal salivary gland function."
9210,1000,"In further studies, the autoantigen SP-1 was identified in ductal epithelia of salivary glands in il14 TG mice by IIF."
9211,1000,SP-1 mRNAs expression increased with growing age in il14 TG mice.
9212,1000,SP-1 mRNA was also identified in labial biopsies of patients with pSS.
9213,1000,"In conclusion, autoantibody to SP-1 is an early marker in pSS."
9214,1000,It is useful to diagnose pSS patients who lack RF or antibodies to Ro/La.
9215,1001,OBJECTIVE: A European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) SS disease activity index (ESSDAI) and a patient-reported index (ESSPRI) have recently been developed and validated.
9216,1001,In our previous study the ESSDAI correlated significantly with serum 2 microglobulin concentration.
9217,1001,We now aim to establish whether the ESSPRI is also associated with serum 2 microglobulin or with other patient-reported indices.
9218,1001,METHODS: The data on 100 consecutive visits of patients with primary SS (pSS) were reviewed from the patient charts.
9219,1001,Patients who had filled out the ESSPRI questionnaire and fulfilled at least four of the revised American-European consensus group criteria for pSS were included.
9220,1001,"Data were gathered on the ESSPRI (0-10 cm) and on the patient's global health assessment [visual analogue scale (VAS) 0-10 cm] (PGH-VAS), pain-VAS (0-10 cm) and HAQ (range 0-3)."
9221,1001,"RESULTS: The ESSPRI correlated significantly with the PGH-VAS (r = 0.753, P < 0.0001), pain-VAS (r = 0.656, P < 0.0001) and HAQ (r = 0.542, P < 0.0001) (Spearman's correlation)."
9222,1001,"It also correlated weakly with serum 2 microglobulin (r = 0.214, P = 0.043) and ESR levels (r = 0.235, P = 0.019)."
9223,1001,"CONCLUSION: The ESSPRI correlated significantly with other patient-reported indices, serum 2 microglobulin and ESR in patients with pSS."
9224,1001,Our results support the view that the ESSPRI is a useful tool in the follow-up of patients with pSS.
9225,1002,"PURPOSE: To describe, apply, and test a new ocular grading system for assessing keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) using lissamine green and fluorescein."
9226,1002,"DESIGN: Prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study."
9227,1002,METHODS: The National Institutes of Health-funded Sjgren's Syndrome International Registry (called Sjgren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance [SICCA]) is developing standardized classification criteria for Sjgren syndrome (SS) and is creating a biospecimen bank for future research.
9228,1002,"Eight SICCA ophthalmologists developed a new quantitative ocular grading system (SICCA ocular staining score [OSS]), and we analyzed OSS distribution among the SICCA cohort and its association with other phenotypic characteristics of SS."
9229,1002,The SICCA cohort includes participants ranging from possibly early SS to advanced disease.
9230,1002,"Procedures include sequenced unanesthetized Schirmer test, tear break-up time, ocular surface staining, and external eye examination at the slit lamp."
9231,1002,"Using statistical analyses and proportional Venn diagrams, we examined interrelationships between abnormal OSS (>or=3) and other characteristics of SS (labial salivary gland [LSG] biopsy with focal lymphocytic sialadenitis and focus score >1 positive anti-SS A antibodies, anti-SS B antibodies, or both)."
9232,1002,"RESULTS: Among 1208 participants, we found strong associations between abnormal OSS, positive serologic results, and positive LSG focus scores (P < .0001)."
9233,1002,"Analysis of the overlapping relationships of these 3 measures defined a large group of participants who had KCS without other components of SS, representing a clinical entity distinct from the KCS associated with SS."
9234,1002,CONCLUSIONS: This new method for assessing KCS will become the means for diagnosing the ocular component of SS in future classification criteria.
9235,1002,We find 2 forms of KCS whose causes may differ.
9236,1003,OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors using established definitions in a large cohort of clinically well-characterized primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) patients and to compare them to healthy controls.
9237,1003,METHODS: Data on cardiovascular risk factors in primary SS patients and controls were collected prospectively using a standardized pro forma.
9238,1003,Cardiovascular risk factors were defined according to established definitions.
9239,1003,The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the primary SS group was determined and compared to that in the control group.
9240,1003,RESULTS: Primary SS patients had a higher prevalence of hypertension (2850% versus 15.525.6%; P < 0.01) and hypertriglyceridemia (21% versus 9.5%; P = 0.002) than age- and sex-matched healthy controls.
9241,1003,"Furthermore, a significant percentage (56%) of hypertensive patients expected to be on antihypertensive treatment according to best practice was not receiving it."
9242,1003,CONCLUSION: Primary SS patients are more than 2 times more likely to experience hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia than age- and sex-matched healthy controls.
9243,1003,"Additionally, hypertension is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in primary SS."
9244,1004,"BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca, xerostomia, and extraglandular abnormalities."
9245,1004,The precise etiology remains unclear.
9246,1004,Previous studies have revealed that the apoptosis played an important role in the pSS.
9247,1004,"Herein, we investigated the expression and effect of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac) in patients with pSS and associated the expression with clinicopathological parameters."
9248,1004,"METHODS: Smac expression was checked in labial salivary glands of surgical specimens from cases of pSS using immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, and Western blot."
9249,1004,The results of immunohistochemistry were analyzed for clinicopathological parameters.
9250,1004,"In addition, the content of Smac in cytoplasm and mitochondria were examined."
9251,1004,"RESULTS: The mRNA of Smac, the content of Smac in cytoplasm, the Smac protein in the pSS patients increased significantly compared with the healthy controls (p < 0.05)."
9252,1004,The content of Smac in mitochondria decreased significantly compared with the healthy controls (p < 0.05).
9253,1004,"The integral optical density of Smac protein levels were positively correlated with IgG (r = 0.7435, p < 0.05) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (r = 0.7925, p < 0.05)."
9254,1004,CONCLUSION: Smac plays an important role in the development of pSS.
9255,1005,"The diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is complex, and the saliva test is a potential method to improve the existing diagnostic criteria."
9256,1005,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of salivary anti-SSA/B antibodies in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), and to analyze their correlations with clinical and laboratory profiles."
9257,1005,"STUDY DESIGN: This study enrolled 100 pSS patients and 140 non-pSS controls, including 40 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, 40 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and 60 healthy controls."
9258,1005,Unstimulated whole saliva and stimulated parotid saliva samples were collected from the subjects.
9259,1005,Salivary anti-SSA/B antibodies were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
9260,1005,Clinical and laboratory data were retrieved from the medical records.
9261,1005,"RESULTS: In the pSS group, the sensitivity of anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies in whole saliva was 49% and 29%, respectively, and the specificity was 87.5% and 95%."
9262,1005,"The sensitivity of anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies in parotid saliva was 32% and 8%, respectively, and the specificity was 95.52% and 97.86%, respectively."
9263,1005,"In the pSS group, the diagnostic accuracy of anti-SSA/B antibodies in whole saliva was significantly higher than in parotid saliva (p<0.05), but was significantly lower than in serum (p<0.05)."
9264,1005,The salivary flow rate in the pSS group positive for whole salivary anti-SSA was significantly lower than in the negative group (p<0.05).
9265,1005,The prevalence of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear factor were significantly higher in salivary SSB-positive pSS patients than in SSB-negative patients (p<0.05).
9266,1005,"CONCLUSIONS: Compared to parotid saliva, whole saliva is a more suitable diagnostic fluid."
9267,1005,Using salivary anti-SSA/B antibodies as a single test item is insufficient given the relatively low sensitivity.
9268,1005,Further studies should investigate the possibility of combining tests for different salivary autoantibodies as a method for diagnosing pSS.
9269,1006,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an update on infections in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjgren's syndrome, particularly addressing their role as triggers of autoimmunity, their impact on mortality, the main microorganisms, the approaches to differential diagnosis with disease flares and recommendations for vaccination."
9270,1006,RECENT FINDINGS: New mechanisms for autoimmunity triggered by Epstein-Barr virus and human commensal microbiota have been described.
9271,1006,The increased risk for tuberculosis was recently demonstrated for the first time in Sjgren's syndrome.
9272,1006,C-reactive protein was reported to be a more sensitive and specific marker for bacterial infections in SLE than procalcitonin and phagocyte-specific S100A8/A9 protein.
9273,1006,Inactivated vaccines are well tolerated and efficacy was demonstrated for influenza vaccine.
9274,1006,Immunogenicity is generally reduced but adequate in SLE.
9275,1006,"Prednisone or immunosuppressants are associated with decreased vaccine serological response, whereas hydroxicloroquine seems to improve vaccine immunogenicity."
9276,1006,Other infection-preventive measures for these diseases include antimalarials and prophylaxis for tuberculosis or Pneumocystis jirovecii.
9277,1006,SUMMARY: Advances in the role of infectious agents as triggers for SLE and Sjgren's syndrome have provided new insights into disease development.
9278,1006,"Knowledge on vaccine immunogenicity, safety and efficacy has improved with evidence of a generally reduced but adequate response for inactivated vaccines in SLE."
9279,1006,Other preventive measures comprise infection prophylaxis and antimalarials.
9280,1007,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a rare autoimmune disease, especially in children."
9281,1007,Juvenile primary SS with interstitial nephritis is rare in Japan.
9282,1007,"We report on a 12-year-old girl in whom salivary gland swelling had recurred from the age of 5 years, SS was diagnosed at the age of 10 years, and interstitial nephritis developed at the age of 12 years."
9283,1007,The patient presented with a chief complaint of swelling of both parotid glands.
9284,1007,"The patient had a history of recurrent parotitis from 5 years of age, with episodes recurring 5 to 6 times a year and resolving within 3 days each time."
9285,1007,"However, at the age of 11 years, the patient had continuous mild swelling of the parotid glands."
9286,1007,"Examination on admission showed bilateral nontender parotid gland swelling; mild swelling of the lower extremities, xerostomia, and xerophthalmia but no exanthem."
9287,1007,"Laboratory findings were as follows: serum protein, 10.1 g/dL; immunoglobulin (Ig) G, 3,828 mg/dL; antinuclear antibodies, 1,280-fold; anti-Ro/SS-A antibody, 512-fold; anti-Ro/SS-B antibody, 4-fold; creatinine, 0.45 mg/dL; blood 2-microglobulin, 2.2 mg/L (slightly elevated); and cystatin C, 0.86 mg/L."
9288,1007,"Urinalysis showed proteinuria and a 2-microglobulin concentration of 11,265 mg/L."
9289,1007,"Thus, this patient had low molecular weight proteinuria."
9290,1007,"Schirmer's test showed decreased tear secretion (5 mm), and fluorescein staining showed marked bilateral superficial punctate keratitis."
9291,1007,"A lip biopsy showed infiltration by small round cells (mild to moderate), interstitial fibrosis, loss of salivary gland parenchyma, and atrophy, with no obvious epimyoepithelial islands, leading to a diagnosis of SS."
9292,1007,"Light microscopic examination of the renal biopsy specimens showed expansion of mononuclear cell infiltration in the renal interstitium, inflammatory cell infiltration of interstitial areas with edema and mild fibrosis, and tubulitis and mononuclear cell infiltration that included many lymphocytes and plasma cells."
9293,1007,There were no pathological findings of glomerulonephritis.
9294,1007,Small arteries showed no obvious abnormalities.
9295,1007,"Immunofluorescent staining showed slight, nonspecific deposition of IgM, but no deposition of IgG, complement 1q, 3, or 4."
9296,1007,"On the basis of the renal biopsy showing nonspecific chronic interstitial nephritis, renal tubular atrophy, and interstitial enlargement, tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with SS was diagnosed."
9297,1008,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to review the frequency and types of inflammatory systemic diseases in a cohort of patients with dry eye, and identify clinical features suggesting the presence of these."
9298,1008,METHODS: Consecutive new patients with a primary diagnosis of dry eye evaluated at a tertiary dry eye center between January 2010 and December 2011 were reviewed retrospectively.
9299,1008,"Standardized questionnaires were used to obtain data regarding systemic symptoms, previous medical diagnoses, and family history."
9300,1008,"Dry eye evaluations included Schirmer testing, tear film break-up time, corneal fluorescein staining, and bulbar conjunctival lissamine green staining."
9301,1008,Clinically significant dry eye was defined as having a Schirmer test score without anesthesia of 10 mm or conjunctival lissamine green staining of 1 using the Oxford scale.
9302,1008,RESULTS: A total of 228 new patients were analyzed.
9303,1008,"Of these, 47.4% (108/228) presented with a known diagnosis of inflammatory disease."
9304,1008,"Based on a review of systems and ocular examination, 81 patients (81/228) underwent a further work-up that revealed 25 additional diagnoses that were not known on presentation."
9305,1008,"The most common newly identified conditions included occult thyroid eye disease (n = 20), primary Sjgren Syndrome (4), and Sjgren Syndrome suspect (1)."
9306,1008,"Female gender, family history of autoimmune disease, self-reported joint pain or dry mouth, external signs of orbital inflammation, and conjunctival chemosis were more common in patients with inflammatory systemic disease as compared with that in patients with no identifiable condition (P < 0.05 for all)."
9307,1008,CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammatory diseases are frequently associated with dry eye in patients evaluated at a tertiary academic center.
9308,1008,Diagnostic evaluations may help uncover previously undiagnosed significant conditions in about one-third of tested patients.
9309,1009,OBJECTIVE: To estimate levels of salivary and serum free light chains (FLCs) and explore its utility as a biomarker in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
9310,1009,METHODS: Patients with pSS classified by American European Consensus group 2002 or American College of Rheumatology 2012 criteria between January 2015 and August 2015 were included.
9311,1009,Healthy staff and non-first degree relatives of patients constituted controls.
9312,1009,"Serum and salivary FLCs were measured by immunoturbidometry using FREELITE() Human Kappa() and Lambda() Free Kit (Binding site, Birmingham, UK), on a Roche Modular P800."
9313,1009,FLCs were compared between cases and controls using the Mann-Whitney U-test.
9314,1009,The receiver operator characteristic curve was constructed to analyze the discriminating ability of salivary and serum kappa and lambda FLCs.
9315,1009,"RESULTS: Salivary and serum FLCs were assayed in 15 patients and 13 patients, respectively, and in 15 controls."
9316,1009,Median age of cases and controls was 34 years.
9317,1009,"Salivary kappa and lambda FLCs were higher in pSS as compared to controls (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively)."
9318,1009,Serum kappa and lambda FLCs were also higher in pSS (both P < 0.05).
9319,1009,Salivary lambda levels were higher in pSS with ocular signs; serum kappa and lambda levels were higher in those with ocular symptoms.
9320,1009,"A cut off of  1.1 mg/L for salivary lambda FLC had a sensitivity and specificity of 73.3% and 93.3%, respectively, for the diagnosis of pSS."
9321,1009,"Serum kappa FLC  30 mg/L had a sensitivity and specificity of 92.3% and 73.3%, respectively."
9322,1009,"CONCLUSION: Serum and salivary FLCs and in particular the latter, are potential biomarkers in pSS."
9323,1009,Larger studies are required for validating the findings.
9324,1010,PURPOSE: To report vision-threatening ocular manifestations of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
9325,1010,DESIGN: Retrospective review.
9326,1010,PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients evaluated at an SS center between January 2007 and May 2011.
9327,1010,METHODS: Data collection was completed in March 2013.
9328,1010,The 2002 American-European consensus criteria were used for diagnosis of SS.
9329,1010,MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of extraglandular ocular findings and timing of their diagnosis relative to that of SS and dry eye were assessed.
9330,1010,RESULTS: One hundred sixty-three patients were included.
9331,1010,"Almost all patients (98%) had a history of dry eye for an average of 10.4 years (median, 7.9 years) before presentation."
9332,1010,"One or more extraglandular ocular manifestations were present in 40 patients (25%), and vision-threatening findings were present in 22 patients (13%)."
9333,1010,Twelve patients (55%) with a vision-threatening ocular finding did not have a diagnosis of SS at presentation.
9334,1010,Sixty-eight patients (42%) had extraglandular systemic manifestations of SS.
9335,1010,"Patients with vision-threatening ocular findings were 3.9 times more likely to have systemic involvement (95% confidence interval, 1.4-11.0; P = 0.010)."
9336,1010,"Peripheral neuropathy, interstitial nephritis, and vasculitis were more common in those with vision-threatening ocular findings compared with patients without (P < 0.05 for all)."
9337,1010,CONCLUSIONS: These results from a tertiary referral-based cohort demonstrate that primary SS frequently is associated with ocular and systemic complications.
9338,1010,Dry eye precedes these findings on average by 1 decade.
9339,1010,"Therefore, ophthalmologists should consider assessing for SS in patients with clinically significant dry eye."
9340,1011,OBJECTIVE: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a condition characterized by a higher mortality rate in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
9341,1011,"However, factors influencing the outcome of patients with pSS-associated ILD remain unclear."
9342,1011,The aim of the present study was to evaluate predictive factors associated with a worse prognosis in pSS-ILD.
9343,1011,METHODS: This retrospective study included 99 consecutive patients with pSS-ILD.
9344,1011,"Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and pulmonary function tests at the time of diagnosis were analyzed."
9345,1011,Chest HRCT images were reviewed by two experienced chest radiologists.
9346,1011,"Prognostic factors were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses, using Cox proportional hazards regression model."
9347,1011,RESULTS: Median age was 68 years (73% women).
9348,1011,"In the total patient population, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 89.8% and 79.0%, respectively."
9349,1011,"Univariate analysis revealed a significant association between prognosis and age, serum Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) levels, and %FVC."
9350,1011,None of the chest HRCT findings were related to patient outcomes.
9351,1011,"Based on multivariate analyses adjusted by age and gender, lower levels of %FVC and higher levels of KL-6 were significantly associated with poor outcomes."
9352,1011,"Using optimal cutoff levels, according to receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, KL-6 > 800 U/mL were significantly associated with worse prognosis (HR: 2.91, 95% CI: 1.04-8.10)."
9353,1011,Patients with elevated serum KL-6 levels (>800 U/mL) showed a higher mortality rate than those without elevated serum KL-6 levels (p=0.02).
9354,1011,CONCLUSIONS: Lower %FVC and higher serum KL-6 levels are predictive factors for poor outcome in patients with pSS-ILD.
9355,1012,"OBJECTIVE: We propose new classification criteria for Sjgren's syndrome (SS), which are needed considering the emergence of biologic agents as potential treatments and their associated comorbidity."
9356,1012,These criteria target individuals with signs/symptoms suggestive of SS.
9357,1012,METHODS: Criteria are based on expert opinion elicited using the nominal group technique and analyses of data from the Sjgren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance.
9358,1012,"Preliminary criteria validation included comparisons with classifications based on the AmericanEuropean Consensus Group (AECG) criteria, a model-based gold standardobtained from latent class analysis (LCA) of data from a range of diagnostic tests, and a comparison with cases and controls collected from sources external to the population used for criteria development."
9359,1012,RESULTS: Validation results indicate high levels of sensitivity and specificity for the criteria.
9360,1012,"Case definition requires at least 2 of the following 3: 1) positive serum anti-SSA and/or anti-SSB or (positive rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody titer >1:320), 2) ocular staining score >3, or 3) presence of focal lymphocytic sialadenitis with a focus score >1 focus/4 mm2 in labial salivary gland biopsy samples."
9361,1012,Observed agreement with the AECG criteria is high when these are applied using all objective tests.
9362,1012,"However, AECG classification based on allowable substitutions of symptoms for objective tests results in poor agreement with the proposed and LCA-derived classifications."
9363,1012,CONCLUSION: These classification criteria developed from registry data collected using standardized measures are based on objective tests.
9364,1012,"Validation indicates improved classification performance relative to existing alternatives, making them more suitable for application in situations where misclassification may present health risks."
9365,1013,Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate in vitro at temperatures <37C but that redissolve if heated; they are broadly divided into 3 classes.
9366,1013,"Cryoglobulinemia has a plethora of clinical manifestations, but it typically presents a vasculitic syndrome, most notably a triad of purpura, arthralgia, and weakness secondary to cryoglobulin deposition in small or medium-sized blood vessels."
9367,1013,The highly variable clinical presentation and inconsistent laboratory isolation of cryoglobulins mean that the diagnosis may be one of exclusion or of retrospective review.
9368,1013,"We describe a case of a 67-year-old woman whose principal symptom was recurrent perioral edema, which was characteristically induced by cold."
9369,1013,Raised cryoglobulins combined with a positive autoantibody screen suggested mixed cryoglobulinemia secondary to Sjgren syndrome.
9370,1013,"However, in the subsequent 6 years, she has remained generally well, having developed no autoimmune, neoplastic, or other disease, suggesting the diagnosis is one of ""essential"" mixed cryoglobulinemia."
9371,1013,No treatment other than symptomatic analgesia has been required.
9372,1014,OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the value of FDG-PET/CT to assess disease activity in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
9373,1014,METHODS: Thirty-two patients with SS who underwent PET/CT were retrospectively analyzed.
9374,1014,"PET/CT activity score was measured using a 6-point scale including the 6 following items (0/1: absence or presence of an item): lymphadenopathy on CT, high-resolution CT (HRCT) evidence of interstitial lung disease (ILD), parotid glands SUVmax >3, submandibular glands SUVmax >3, lymph node uptake, ILD uptake."
9375,1014,Combined PET/CT score was correlated to ESSDAI (EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index) score and other parameters of SS activity.
9376,1014,"RESULTS: Pathological FDG uptake was observed in 75% of patients (24/32): lymph-nodes (n=19, 60%), salivary glands (n=17, 53%), lungs (n=9, 28%), and thyroid (n=2)."
9377,1014,"Median ESSDAI and PET/CT activity scores were 9.5 [5-12] and 2 [0-3], respectively."
9378,1014,"PET/CT activity score correlated with ESSDAI (r=0.49, p=0.005), unlike SUVmax."
9379,1014,"Patients with a high ESSDAI score had a higher PET/CT activity score than patients with a low ESSDAI score (3 vs 1, p=0.004)."
9380,1014,"PET was also correlated with gammaglobulin levels (r=0.43, p=0.02), but not with the presence of cryoglobulinemia, activated complement or beta-2 microglobulin levels."
9381,1014,"The FDG uptake in patients with lymphoma (n=4) was higher than in patients without lymphoma (SUVmax=5.4 vs. 3.2, p=0.05)."
9382,1014,"CONCLUSION: We described a new PET/CT activity score, which correlates to ESSDAI and could help to assess disease activity in SS patients."
9383,1014,"PET can also help in the diagnosis of lymphoma, even if inflammatory lymph nodes can be frequently observed in SS patients."
9384,1015,"BACKGROUND: Smoking is reported to affect the risk of a number of chronic disorders, including rheumatic diseases."
9385,1015,Previous cross-sectional studies have shown a lower frequency of smoking in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
9386,1015,The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of smoking and socioeconomic status on the risk of subsequent diagnosis of pSS in a nested case-control study.
9387,1015,METHOD: Participants in two large population-based health surveys who were later diagnosed with pSS were identified through linkage with the Malm Sjgren's Syndrome Register.
9388,1015,Matched controls were obtained from the health surveys.
9389,1015,RESULTS: Sixty-three patients with pSS with pre-diagnostic data from the health surveys were identified.
9390,1015,Current smoking was associated with a significantly lower risk of later being diagnosed with pSS (odds ratio (OR) 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.6).
9391,1015,"Furthermore, former smoking was associated with an increased risk of subsequent pSS diagnosis (OR 4.0; 95% CI 1.8-8.8) compared to never smoking."
9392,1015,Similar results were found in a sub-analysis of patients with reported symptom onset after inclusion in the health surveys.
9393,1015,Socioeconomic status and levels of formal education had no significant impact on the risk of later being diagnosed with pSS.
9394,1015,"CONCLUSION: In this nested case-control study, current smoking was associated with a reduced risk of subsequent diagnosis of pSS."
9395,1015,"In addition, former smoking was associated with an increased risk."
9396,1015,Whether this reflects a biological effect of cigarette smoking or other mechanisms should be further investigated in future studies.
9397,1016,"A 57-year-old Japanese woman developed skin eruption, pleuritis, pancytopenia, parotid gland swelling and glomerulonephritis after 7-month treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C. Disease-specific autoantibodies such as anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-Sm and anti-dsDNA antibodies became positive."
9398,1016,The diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjgren's syndrome was made and treatment with glucocorticoid pulse followed by oral glucocorticoid was started.
9399,1016,It is highly probable that interferon-alpha-induced systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjgren's syndrome in this case.
9400,1016,Interferon-alpha might be important pathogenically in these diseases.
9401,1017,"BACKGROUND: Despite men being less prone to develop autoimmune diseases, male sex has been associated with a more severe disease course in several systemic autoimmune diseases."
9402,1017,"In the present study, we aimed to investigate differences in the clinical presentation of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) between the sexes and establish whether male sex is associated with a more severe form of long-term pSS."
9403,1017,METHODS: Our study population included 967 patients with pSS (899 females and 68 males) from Scandinavian clinical centers.
9404,1017,The mean follow-up time (years) was 8.87.6 for women and 8.56.2 for men (ns).
9405,1017,Clinical data including serological and hematological parameters and glandular and extraglandular manifestations were compared between men and women.
9406,1017,"RESULTS: Male patient serology was characterized by more frequent positivity for anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB (p=0.02), and ANA (p=0.02)."
9407,1017,"Further, men with pSS were more frequently diagnosed with interstitial lung disease (p=0.008), lymphadenopathy (p=0.04) and lymphoma (p=0.007)."
9408,1017,"Conversely, concomitant hypothyroidism was more common among female patients (p=0.009)."
9409,1017,CONCLUSIONS: We observe enhanced serological responses and higher frequencies of lymphoma-related extraglandular manifestations in men with pSS.
9410,1017,"Notably, lymphoma itself was also significantly more common in men."
9411,1017,These observations may reflect an aggravated immune activation and a more severe pathophysiological state in male patients with pSS and indicate a personalized managing of the disease due to the influence of the sex of patients with pSS.
9412,1018,"OBJECTIVE: Although high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is useful for the characterization of minute morphological changes in the lungs, no study has investigated risk factors for lung involvement detected by HRCT in patients with Sjgren's syndrome with or without respiratory symptoms."
9413,1018,"The aim of the current study was to investigate risk factors for lung involvement in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome detected by HRCT, with a particular focus on airway and interstitial lung diseases."
9414,1018,METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome and investigated risk factors for lung involvement detected by HRCT.
9415,1018,A total of 101 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome with initial HRCT examinations were enrolled.
9416,1018,"RESULTS: Higher age, dry mouth, and higher labial gland biopsy focus scores (4) were risk factors for airway diseases (odds ratio [OR] 1.064 confidence interval [CI] 1.026-1.102, OR 8.795 CI 2.317-33.378 and OR 3.261 CI 1.100-9.675, respectively) in the multivariable analysis."
9417,1018,"Higher age, male sex, and higher labial gland biopsy focus scores (4) were risk factors for interstitial lung diseases (OR 1.078 CI 1.032-1.127, OR 12.178 CI 1.121-132.307 and OR 3.954 CI 1.423-10.987, respectively) in the multivariable analysis."
9418,1018,The presence of anti-T-lymphotropic virus type 1 antibodies was significantly more common in patients with airway diseases.
9419,1018,CONCLUSIONS: This study showed significant associations of labial gland biopsy focus scores and dry mouth with pulmonary manifestations in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome.
9420,1018,Focus scores as well as dry mouth may reflect lymphoproliferative activity in the lungs in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome.
9421,1019,A patient with primary Sjgren's syndrome complicated with primary biliary cirrhosis and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia is presented.
9422,1019,"She was 38 years old and was admitted to our hospital for generalized pruritus, xerostomia, xerophthalmia, fatigue, and reticulonodular changes on her chest X-ray."
9423,1019,"With the findings of ground-glass attenuation and centrilobular nodules in high resolution computerized tomography, the diagnosis of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia was made."
9424,1019,Oral methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day and ursodeoxycholic acid 15 mg/kg/day were started.
9425,1019,"At the 6th month follow-up, she had no complaints, and pulmonary function tests and high resolution computerized tomography were normal."
9426,1019,"This is the first case of Sjgren's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia in the English literature."
9427,1020,The objective of this study is to document a series of cases of occupationally derived autoimmune disease.
9428,1020,Individuals with occupational exposure to acrylamides were evaluated clinically and biochemically/immunologically for evidence of autoimmune disease.
9429,1020,Symptoms and signs and immuno-reactivity were monitored during exposure-free and re-exposure as part of the individuals' clinical evaluation.
9430,1020,"Six individuals with occupational acrylamide exposure had clinical and laboratory alterations characteristic of drug-induced autoimmune disease, specifically lupus, anti-phospholipid syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, and polymyositis."
9431,1020,The similarity of the full spectrum of disease in the reported patients to that found with procainamide strongly suggests the effects of occupational exposure.
9432,1020,"This uncontrolled study suggests the need for a full epidemiologic analysis of all individuals working with such occupational exposure, including full clinical and immunological examination."
9433,1021,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate, by musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS), articular involvement in primary SS (pSS) patients by analysing hand and wrist changes, and to correlate them with clinical evaluation and laboratory tests."
9434,1021,"METHODS: Thirty-two pSS patients underwent clinical and laboratory examinations, including the SS Disease Damage Index (SSDDI) and the SS Disease Activity Index (SSDAI)."
9435,1021,"MSUS was performed in all patients in both hands and wrists, evaluating the presence of inflammation within joints and periarticular tissues, and the existence of permanent joint damage."
9436,1021,"For synovial hypertrophy, joint effusion and Doppler signal findings, a semi-quantitative score (0-3) was used indicating the degree of involvement (0 = normal; 1 = mild change; 2 = moderate change; and 3 = severe change)."
9437,1021,"For tenosynovitis and bone erosions, a dichotomous score (0 = absent and 1 = present) was applied."
9438,1021,RESULTS: Sonographic signs of synovitis of the radio-ulno-carpal joint were found in 17 (26.5%) out of 64 wrists.
9439,1021,Wrist synovitis was found in 12 (37.5%) out of 32 patients.
9440,1021,Ultrasonographic examination of the hand did not show significant changes.
9441,1021,A statistically significant correlation was found between SSDDI score and the degree of sonographic signs of synovial proliferation in the wrist (P = 0.04).
9442,1021,The correlation between the incidence of clinical involvement and the presence of pathological ultrasonographic findings was not significant.
9443,1021,Patients with synovitis had a higher median age and higher median SSDDI (P = 0.004).
9444,1021,"CONCLUSIONS: In pSS patients, MSUS may be considered a useful tool for detecting synovitis since articular involvement can often be silent but correlated with SSDDI."
9445,1022,BACKGROUND: Rheumatologic diseases may cause neurologic disorders that mimic multiple sclerosis (MS).
9446,1022,A panel of serum autoantibodies is often obtained as part of the evaluation of patients suspected of having MS.
9447,1022,"OBJECTIVES: To determine, in light of recently revised diagnostic criteria for MS, neuromyelitis optica, and Sjogren's Syndrome, if testing for autoantibodies in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MS would reveal a frequency or demonstrate a clinical utility divergent from previous reports or lead to identification of undiagnosed cases of Sjogren's Syndrome."
9448,1022,METHODS: Convenience sample cross-sectional study of MS patients recruited from the OHSU Multiple Sclerosis Center.
9449,1022,RESULTS: Autoantibodies were detected in 38% (35/91) of patients with MS and were not significantly associated with disease characteristics or severity.
9450,1022,"While four patients had SSA antibodies, none met diagnostic criteria for Sjogren's Syndrome."
9451,1022,CONCLUSIONS: Rheumatologic autoantibodies are frequently found in MS patients and are not associated with disease severity or systemic rheumatologic disease.
9452,1022,Our demonstration of the low specificity of these autoantibodies suggests that the diagnostic utility and cost-effectiveness of testing is not supported when there is strong clinical suspicion of MS and low clinical suspicion of rheumatologic disease.
9453,1023,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic chronic autoimmune disorder affecting the lacrimal and salivary glands.
9454,1023,"SS may manifest as primary SS (pSS) or secondary SS (sSS), the latter occurring in the context of another autoimmune disorder."
9455,1023,"In both cases, the dry eyes and mouth affect the patient's quality of life."
9456,1023,"Late complications may include blindness, dental tissue destruction, oral candidiasis and lymphoma."
9457,1023,"This paper reports two cases of SS, each of them presenting unusual oral nodular lesion diagnosed as relapsed MALT lymphoma and mucocele."
9458,1023,"The importance of the diagnosis, treatment and management of the oral lesions by a dentist during the care of SS patients is emphasized, as the oral manifestations of SS may compromise the patient's quality of life."
9459,1024,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze bone marrow stromal antigen-2 (BST-2) levels in labial glands, total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and PBMC subpopulations from primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients and determine the correlation between BST-2 expression and clinical characteristics."
9460,1024,MATERIALS AND METHODS: PBMC subsets were positively separated using magnetic microbeads.
9461,1024,"BST-2 mRNA levels in labial glands, total PBMCs and PBMC subsets of 30 pSS and 30 healthy control (HC) subjects were investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)."
9462,1024,Distribution of BST-2-positive cells in the labial glands was assessed by immunohistochemistry.
9463,1024,RESULTS: BST-2 was significantly increased in pSS labial glands and was positively correlated with the VAS value for parotid gland swelling and rheumatoid factor and 2-microglobulin serum levels.
9464,1024,BST-2 levels were statistically different between pSS patients with positive and negative expression of anti-SSA antibody.
9465,1024,"Positive focal infiltrating lymphocytes and adjacent ductal epithelial cells were observed in labial glands from pSS patients, while there were a few scattered positive ductal epithelial cells in controls."
9466,1024,BST-2 was also up-regulated in CD19+B cells and the remaining CD4-CD8-CD19- PBMCs.
9467,1024,"CONCLUSION: BST-2 was aberrantly expressed in pSS patients, and expression in labial glands was positively correlated with important clinical characteristics; thus, it may be a potential biomarker of pSS activity."
9468,1025,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands leading to qualitatively altered and diminished or absent salivary and lachrymal secretion, and by marked B-cell hyperreactivity."
9469,1025,Many efforts have been made to define a panel of salivary and lachrymal markers helpful to design diagnostic tests able to replace blood tests and tissue biopsies for the diagnosis of primary and secondary SS.
9470,1025,"Several proteomic-based studies have indicated that a number of proteins and peptides can be considered SS biomarkers, being 2-3-fold up- or down-regulated compared to normal subject or having an exclusive presence in the saliva or tears of SS patients."
9471,1025,"Unfortunately, several factors make it difficult to define a comprehensive salivary and lachrymal panel of markers of SS, as the lack of a comprehensive proteomic analysis of human tears and saliva of healthy subjects, the lack of uniform protocols to collect and treat these samples, and the high grade of posttranslational modification of the proteins in these fluids."
9472,1026,Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M(3) (M3R) is a GPCR on exocrine gland cells involved in fluid secretion.
9473,1026,"In the last two decades, evidence has been accumulated arguing for a role of autoantibodies (aab) against M3R in the development of Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
9474,1026,"In this review, we provide an updated overview on this issue and critically discuss the relation between autoimmunity to M3R and SS pathogenesis."
9475,1026,"Clinical data as well as findings from experimental disease were summarized in categories addressing the presence of aab against M3R in SS patients, the function of anti-M3R aab, the association of aab against M3R with SS-related phenotypes, in vivo pathogenicity of transferred aab against M3R in mice, and mouse models induced via immunization with M3R."
9476,1026,"Based on these comprehensive data, we propose a hypothetic model for the role of aab against M3R in the pathogenesis of SS."
9477,1027,The presence of autoantibodies is characteristic of autoimmune diseases.
9478,1027,It is widely accepted that autoantibodies provide crucial diagnostic and prognostic information for autoimmune diseases.
9479,1027,"Indeed, numerous studies have demonstrated that the appearance of autoantibodies precedes the clinical onset of autoimmune diseases."
9480,1027,"We performed a literature review regarding the appearance of autoantibodies that preceded the clinical onset of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjgren's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis."
9481,1027,Herein we review and comment on the major findings of these studies.
9482,1028,The treat-to-target (T2T) strategy improved long-term survival of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
9483,1028,Little was known about applying the T2T strategy in primary Sjogren's syndrome-associated PAH (pSS-PAH).
9484,1028,We investigated how to identify patients who are more likely to reach the treatment goals in a cohort of pSS-PAH.
9485,1028,"In this way, we explored the possibility of implementing T2T in pSS-PAH."
9486,1028,Data were retrospectively collected from patients visiting our center between 2007 and 2017.
9487,1028,PAH was confirmed by right heart catheterization (RHC).
9488,1028,Patients were treated following the T2T strategy.
9489,1028,PAH treatment goals were defined by the 5th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension.
9490,1028,The primary end point was reaching the PAH treatment goals.
9491,1028,"Of the 62 patients enrolled, 98.4% were female, with a mean age of 38.99.1years at the diagnostic RHC."
9492,1028,"The median disease duration of pSS was 46months (0-365), while the median disease duration of PAH was 12months (0-149)."
9493,1028,"Following the T2T strategy, 32 (50%) patients achieved the treatment goals."
9494,1028,"The 1-, 3-, and 5- year cumulative rates of reaching the goals were 40.6, 67.4, and 73.9%, respectively."
9495,1028,"Predictive factors included using immunosuppressants (HR 4.715, 95% CI 1.101-20.192, p=0.037) and right ventricular anterior-posterior diameter (RV-APD) >30mm at baseline (HR 0.426, 95% CI 0.188-0.968, p=0.042)."
9496,1028,The results provide strong evidence that patients who received immunosuppressants are more likely to reach the treatment goals.
9497,1028,"In contrast, impaired RV structure correlates to worse treatment response."
9498,1028,The T2T strategy is effective in pSS-PAH.
9499,1029,Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is rarely associated with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
9500,1029,This is the first documented case of a patient undergoing chronic hemodialysis with SS who developed TMA.
9501,1029,"TMA is an infrequent, life-threatening multisystem disorder characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, accompanied by microvascular thrombosis that causes variable degrees of tissue ischemia and infarction."
9502,1029,It is important to make a quick diagnosis of TMA to cure the reported case as early as possible.
9503,1029,"The patients with TMA should be diagnosed quickly, and in this case plasma exchange and corticosteroids in combination with cyclophosphamide have been associated with a recurrence free period."
9504,1029,Cyclophosphamide has led to the development of treatment protocols using alternative immunosuppressive agents in patients with SS showing a poor response to plasmapheresis and potentially life-threatening manifestations.
9505,1029,"Further research is required to ascertain the sensitivity, specificity, efficacy, timing, cost-benefit ratio, and necessity of cyclophosphamide in the setting of TMA complicating SS."
9506,1030,INTRODUCTION: Modern knowlegde defines Mikuliczs disease as a part of immunoglobulin G4-related disease.
9507,1030,"The main feature is the presence of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, immunoglobulin G4 plasma cells positivity, distinctive storiform fibrosis and moderate eosinophilia."
9508,1030,CASE REPORT: A 59-years old male presented with a mild keratoconjuctivitis sicca and enlarged lacrimal and salivary glands during the last two years.
9509,1030,"Althought clinical presentation of the patient was typical, earlier testing did not pinpoint Mikulicz s disease."
9510,1030,"By typical clinical presentation, elevated serum immunoglobulin G4 level and histopathological finding of lacrimal glands tissue we diagnosed Mikuliczs disease successfully treated with corticosteroid therapy."
9511,1030,CONCLUSION: We reported the first case of IgG4-related Mikuliczs disease in Serbia.
9512,1030,Our report highlights IgG4-related Mikulicz` s disease as an important differential diagnosis with Sjgren`s syndrome and lymphoproliferative disease in rheumatological practice.
9513,1031,Purpose.
9514,1031,"To determine the effectiveness of autologous platelet lysate (APL) eye drops in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (SS) dry eye, refractory to standard therapy, in comparison with patients treated with artificial tears."
9515,1031,We focused on the effect of APL on cornea morphology with the in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM).
9516,1031,Methods.
9517,1031,"Patients were assigned to two groups: group A used autologous platelet lysate QID, and group B used preservative-free artificial tears QID, for 90 days."
9518,1031,"Ophthalmological assessments included ocular surface disease index (OSDI), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Schirmer test, fluorescein score, and breakup time (BUT)."
9519,1031,"A subgroup of patients in group A underwent IVCM: corneal basal epithelium, subbasal nerves, Langerhans cells, anterior stroma activated keratocytes, and reflectivity were evaluated."
9520,1031,Results.
9521,1031,"60 eyes of 30 patients were enrolled; in group A (n = 20 patients) mean OSDI, fluorescein score, and BUT showed significant improvement compared with group B (n = 10 patients)."
9522,1031,The IVCM showed a significant increase in basal epithelium cells density and subbasal nerve plexus density and number and a decrease in Langerhans cells density (p < 0.05).
9523,1031,Conclusion.
9524,1031,APL was found effective in the treatment of SS dry eye.
9525,1031,IVCM seems to be a useful tool to visualize cornea morphologic modifications.
9526,1032,"The article reviews literature on relationships between polymorphic variants of the genes THBS1, GTF2I, MUC1, TRIM21, STAT4, PTPN22 with clinical features of dry keratoconjunctivitis in rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome."
9527,1032,The development and implementation of a method for analyzing polymorphic gene variants used to diagnose dry keratoconjunctivitis in rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome will allow assessment of the possibility of developing dry keratoconjunctivitis and/or its progression in patients with autoimmune diseases or in people at risk.
9528,1032,"Determination of clinical and morphological regularities of dry keratoconjunctivitis in accordance with the revealed molecular and genetic changes will contribute to better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of ophthalmological manifestations of autoimmune diseases, and will also help improve the diagnostics and prognosis of dry keratoconjunctivitis."
9529,1033,PURPOSE: To describe the clinical features and outcomes of corneal melt associated with Boston type I keratoprosthesis (KPro) implantation.
9530,1033,METHODS: Medical records of patients who experienced corneal melt following KPro implantation were reviewed retrospectively.
9531,1033,RESULTS: Sixty-six adult patients had KPro implantation from January 2004 to November 2010.
9532,1033,Six patients had an underlying inflammatory ocular surface disorder.
9533,1033,Four experienced corneal melt (6.1%) 5-42 months after the initial surgery.
9534,1033,One patient was diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome as a result of diagnostic workup following melt.
9535,1033,Three patients were treated with systemic immunomodulatory therapy; two experienced fungal keratitis and subsequent endophthalmitis.
9536,1033,KPro had to be explanted and replaced with donor cornea in all cases.
9537,1033,"CONCLUSIONS: KPro-associated corneal melt is uncommon and appears to occur in patients with preexisting inflammatory disorders, which might not have been previously diagnosed."
9538,1033,Timely explantation of KPro and replacement with donor cornea may prevent a poor outcome.
9539,1034,OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for accurately diagnosing immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing sialadenitis (IgG4-SS).
9540,1034,STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
9541,1034,METHODS: We reviewed the records of 64 patients with IgG4-SS (35 male and 29 female patients) and 10 patients with clinically suspected IgG4-SS.
9542,1034,"Pathological diagnoses of patients clinically suspected with IgG4-SS included four cases of malignant lymphoma, one case of multicentric Castleman disease, one case of Sjgren's syndrome, and four cases of sialadenitis."
9543,1034,All patients underwent submandibular gland (SMG) biopsies and baseline FDG-PET/CT evaluation.
9544,1034,"Clinical, serological, pathological, and PET/CT findings were analyzed."
9545,1034,We also investigated maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) in the salivary glands of 15 patients with malignant disease of the salivary glands during the same period.
9546,1034,"RESULTS: Increased FDG uptake in the SMG and parotid gland was found in 63 (98%) and 23 (35%) patients with IgG4-SS, respectively."
9547,1034,"FDG uptake of the bilateral SMG and unilateral SMG was recorded in 57 patients (89%) and six patients (9%), respectively."
9548,1034,Mean SUVmax in patients with malignant disease of the salivary glands was significantly higher than that in patients with IgG4-SS (P = .035).
9549,1034,"We defined a positive test for IgG4-SS diagnosis as high SMG FDG uptake and serum IgG4 level 135 mg/dL, resulting in a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 96.9%, 90.0%, and 86.4%, respectively."
9550,1034,CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET/CT findings in combination with serological and clinical findings may have the capacity to diagnose IgG4-SS and lead to less-invasive biopsy procedures.
9551,1034,LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.
9552,1034,"Laryngoscope, 128:1120-1125, 2018."
9553,1035,"Examination of biopsy-obtained salivary gland tissue provides valuable insights for the diagnosis, classification and treatment of patients with primary Sjgren syndrome."
9554,1035,Could the study of biomarkers present in saliva provide a noninvasive alternative?
9555,1036,"OBJECTIVE: To determine excess productivity losses and costs of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and Sjgren's syndrome (SS) at the population level."
9556,1036,"METHODS: Administrative databases from the province of British Columbia, Canada, were used to establish population-based cohorts of SLE, SSc, and SS, and matched comparison cohorts were selected from the general population."
9557,1036,"Random samples from these cohorts were surveyed about time absent from paid and unpaid work and working at reduced levels/efficiency (presenteeism), using validated labor questionnaires."
9558,1036,"We estimated excess productivity losses and costs of each diagnosis (over and above nonsystemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases [non-SARDs]), using 2-part models and work disability rates (not employed due to health)."
9559,1036,"RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 167 SLE, 42 SSc, and 90 SS patients, and by 375 non-SARDs (comparison group) participants."
9560,1036,"Altogether, predicted excess hours of paid and unpaid work loss were 3.5, 3.2, and 3.4 hours per week for SLE, SSc, and SS patients, respectively."
9561,1036,"Excess costs were $86, $69, and $84 (calculated as 2015 Canadian dollars) per week, or $4,494, $3,582, and $4,357 per person annually, respectively."
9562,1036,"Costs for productivity losses from paid work stemmed mainly from presenteeism (SLE = 69% of costs, SSc = 67%, SS = 64%, and non-SARDs = 53%), not from absenteeism."
9563,1036,"However, many working-age patients were not employed at all, due to health (SLE = 36%, SSc = 32%, SS = 30%, and non-SARDs = 18%), and the majority of total productivity costs were from unpaid work loss (SLE = 73% of costs, SSc = 74%, SS = 60%, and non-SARDs = 47%)."
9564,1036,"Adjusted excess costs from these unpaid production losses were $127, $100, and $82 per week, respectively, among SLE, SSc, and SS patients."
9565,1036,"CONCLUSION: In this population-based sample of prevalent SLE, SSc, and SS, lost productivity costs were substantial, mainly from presenteeism and unpaid work impairments."
9566,1037,"In different bioassays, functional antibodies reacting with the human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3(mAchR3) have been detected in sera from patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS), and there is strong evidence that those antibodies may have pathogenetic relevance."
9567,1037,"However, depending on the method of detection, their prevalence varied."
9568,1037,"Furthermore, those bioassays are difficult to standardize."
9569,1037,We report on the development and optimization of a novel test system based on a luminometric method to determine downstream signalling of mAchR3 which produces specific and reproducible results.
9570,1037,Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells were transfected with plasmids encoding mAchR3 and a green fluorescence protein (GFP)/aequorin fusion protein.
9571,1037,"Incubation of cells with carbachol resulted in an increase in intracellular [Ca(2+)], which was detected by measuring light emission with a luminometer, and the effect of incubation with patients' immunoglobulins (Ig) was evaluated."
9572,1037,"Optimal cell density, Ig preparation and time of incubation with patients' sera were determined."
9573,1037,"Sera from patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS; n=40), systemic sclerosis (SSc; n=47), myasthenia gravis (MG; n=133) and 50 blood donors were analysed."
9574,1037,"Optimal assay conditions were obtained with a cell density of 100000 cells/ml, isolation of Ig by ammonium sulphate precipitation and short-term incubation."
9575,1037,"Based on this highly reliable assay, 50% of the pSS patients had antibodies which inhibited carbachol-induced activation of mAchR3; none of the SSc patients, 6% of the patients with MG and 12% of the blood donors had antibodies which reacted with the mAchR3."
9576,1037,"This method facilitates the determination of functional anti-mAchR3 antibodies in patients' sera, confirmed their high prevalence in pSS patients and may, therefore, help to analyse their pathogenetic and clinical relevance in more detail."
9577,1038,OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the Sjgren's syndrome B (SSB)-positive/Sjgren's syndrome A (SSA)-negative antibody profile is associated with key phenotypic features of SS.
9578,1038,"METHODS: Among registrants in the Sjgren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) with possible or established SS, we compared anti-SSA/anti-SSB reactivity profiles against concurrent phenotypic features."
9579,1038,"We fitted logistic regression models to explore the association between anti-SSA/anti-SSB reactivity profile and each key SS phenotypic feature, controlling for potential confounders."
9580,1038,"RESULTS: Among 3297 participants, 2061 (63%) had negative anti-SSA/anti-SSB, 1162 (35%) had anti-SSA with or without anti-SSB, and 74 (2%) anti-SSB alone."
9581,1038,"Key SS phenotypic features were more prevalent and had measures indicative of greater disease activity in those participants with anti-SSA, either alone or with anti-SSB, than in those with anti-SSB alone or negative SSA/SSB serology."
9582,1038,"These between-group differences were highly significant and not explained by confounding by age, race/ethnicity or gender."
9583,1038,Participants with anti-SSB alone were comparable to those with negative SSA/SSB serology in their association with these key phenotypic features.
9584,1038,"Among SICCA participants classified with SS on the basis of the American-European Consensus Group or American College of Rheumatology criteria, only 2% required the anti-SSB-alone test result to meet these criteria."
9585,1038,"CONCLUSIONS: The presence of anti-SSB, without anti-SSA antibodies, had no significant association with SS phenotypic features, relative to seronegative participants."
9586,1038,The solitary presence of anti-SSB antibodies does not provide any more support than negative serology for the diagnosis of SS.
9587,1038,This serological profile should thus be interpreted cautiously in clinical practice and potentially eliminated from future classification criteria.
9588,1039,"In the past, there were no studies to evaluate the incidence of Sjogren's syndrome and its relationship with sex and age in patients with systemic sclerosis."
9589,1039,"In this study, we enrolled 2217 patients with systemic sclerosis and 6485 controls from Taiwan's Registry of Catastrophic Illness database and National Health Insurance Research Database."
9590,1039,"Every patient with systemic sclerosis was matched to at most three controls by sex, age, month, and year of first diagnosis of systemic sclerosis."
9591,1039,Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of Sjogren's syndrome in patients with systemic sclerosis and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated.
9592,1039,Cox hazard regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR).
9593,1039,"Both male and female patients with systemic sclerosis had higher incidences of Sjogren's syndrome (SIR: 7.59, 95% CI=2.97-19.51; SIR: 7.59, 95% CI=5.56-10.42, respectively)."
9594,1039,The incidence of Sjogren's syndrome in patients with systemic sclerosis was still higher compared with control when stratified according to age.
9595,1039,"Age at diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome was earlier in patients with systemic sclerosis in both male and female groups (p=0.018; p<0.001, respectively)."
9596,1039,"Systemic sclerosis was associated with Sjogren's syndrome after adjusting for age, sex, and various autoimmune diseases (HR: 5.98, 95% CI=4.79-7.47, p<0.001)."
9597,1039,"Common cytokines, overlapping antibodies, and similar risk alleles were all potential causes of increased incidence of Sjogren's syndrome in systemic sclerosis."
9598,1040,PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of 2% rebamipide suspension in treatment of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) in patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS) with or without punctal occlusions.
9599,1040,"METHODS: Thirty patients with SS, diagnosed based on the presence of autoantibodies and/or focus score >1 on lip biopsies, with corneal fluorescein staining scores (FSS) >3, and conjunctival lissamine green-staining scores (LSS) >3, were treated 4 times daily for 4 weeks with 2% rebamipide ocular suspension."
9600,1040,"Ocular examinations were performed before treatment and 2 and 4 weeks after treatment to evaluate FSS (0-9), LSS (0-6), and tear film break-up time (BUT)."
9601,1040,Hyaluronate and/or artificial tears were not discontinued.
9602,1040,"The patients were interviewed regarding the 5 major KCS symptoms, foreign body sensation, dry eye sensation, photophobia, ocular pain, and blurred vision, with each graded from none (0) to very severe (4)."
9603,1040,"RESULTS: Of the 30 patients, 3 failed to attend all sessions, leaving 27 (25 females, 2 males, mean age 62.5  10.8 years) to be studied."
9604,1040,"FSS and LSS showed improvement at week 2, but BUT showed improvement later, at week 4."
9605,1040,All 5 symptoms improved significantly.
9606,1040,"When the patients were divided into 3 groups according to the presence of punctal occlusions, FSS and LSS were found to improve in all groups, but BUT improved only in patients with both puncta occluded at week 4."
9607,1040,"CONCLUSIONS: Rebamipide ophthalmic suspension was effective in treating KCS of patients with SS, probably by increasing mucins and suppressing inflammatory cytokines."
9608,1040,Punctal occlusions resulted in sufficient retention of tear fluid to enhance the activities of rebamipide and improve BUT.
9609,1041,OBJECTIVE: To identify numbers of participants in the UK Primary Sjgren's Syndrome Registry (UKPSSR) who would fulfil eligibility criteria for previous/current or potential clinical trials in primary SS (pSS) in order to optimize recruitment.
9610,1041,METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of UKPSSR cohort data of 688 participants who had pSS with evaluable data.
9611,1041,"RESULTS: In relation to previous/current trials, 75.2% fulfilled eligibility for the Belimumab in Subjects with Primary Sjgren's Syndrome study (Belimumab), 41.4% fulfilled eligibility for the Trial of Remicade in primary Sjgren's syndrome study (Infliximab), 35.4% for the Efficacy of Tocilizumab in Primary Sjgren's Syndrome study (Tocilizumab), 31.6% for the Tolerance and Efficacy of Rituximab in Sjgren's Disease study (Rituximab), 26.9% for the Trial of anti-B-cell therapy in pSS study (Rituximab) and 26.6% for the Efficacy and Safety of Abatacept in Patients With Primary Sjgren's Syndrome study (Abatacept)."
9612,1041,"If recent measures of outcome, such as the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) score 5 (measure of patient symptoms) and the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) score 5 (measure of systemic disease activity) are incorporated into a study design, with requirements for an unstimulated salivary flow >0 and anti-Ro positivity, then the pool of eligible participants is reduced to 14.3%."
9613,1041,"CONCLUSION: The UKPSSR identified a number of options for trial design, including selection on ESSDAI 5, ESSPRI 5 and serological and other parameters."
9614,1042,"AIM: Patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) have at least 60% probability of having an autoimmune extrahepatic condition, with the most common being Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
9615,1042,"The impacts of SS on the response and outcomes in ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)-treated patients with PBC, however, remain unclear."
9616,1042,The aim of this study was to document the biochemical responses and clinical outcomes of UDCA-treated patients with concomitant SS and to compare the findings to those of patients with PBC alone.
9617,1042,METHODS: Data from consecutive patients with PBC who visited West China Hospital affiliated with Sichuan University between October 2013 and October 2017 were reviewed retrospectively.
9618,1042,RESULTS: The study populations consisted of 226 patients with PBC alone and 56 with PBC/SS.
9619,1042,"The median ages, proportions of female patients, Fib-4 scores, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/platelet ratio index (APRI) at baseline in the two cohorts were similar."
9620,1042,"At presentation, patients with PBC/SS had higher serum IgG levels and positive rates for serum antinuclear antibody (ANA) than patients with PBC alone (all P < 0.05)."
9621,1042,There was no statistically significant difference between the rate of biochemical response to UDCA at 1 year in the PBC/SS and PBC alone groups.
9622,1042,The UK-PBC risk scores and GLOBE scores in UDCA-treated patients in the two cohorts were also similar.
9623,1042,"During the follow-up period, the differences in the liver enzyme levels, Fib-4 scores, APRI, and incidence of liver-related adverse events were not significant."
9624,1042,"CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective, single-center study suggest that the response and clinical outcomes of UDCA-treated patients with PBC are not adversely affected by concomitant SS."
9625,1043,The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of sicca complex (SC) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and its association with clinical and laboratory features of liver disease.
9626,1043,Subjective and objective criteria of xerophthalmia and xerostomia were investigated in 120 HCV Egyptian patients.
9627,1043,"The lacrimal gland function was assessed by: tear film break-up time and lid parallel conjunctival folds test (LIPCOF), dacroscintigraphy (DSG) for lacrimal drainage and that of salivary glands by sialoscintigraphy."
9628,1043,Sixty six of 120 patients (55%) had SC; all (100%) were proved to have xerostomia by sialoscintigraphy and xerophthalmia detected by ophthalmologic tests.
9629,1043,Using dacroscintigraphy all SC patients (100%) were positive for lacrimal drainage abnormalities.
9630,1043,Only 10.1% were symptomatic for SC.
9631,1043,None of our patients had anti-Ro or anti-La antibodies.
9632,1043,"The presence of SC was associated with older age (r=0.28, p=0.00), female gender (p=0.001), cirrhosis (r=0.34, p=0.00), thrombocytopenia (r=-0.72, p=0.00), and rheumatologic manifestation (p=0.000), but not with viral load (r=0.19, p=0.06)."
9633,1043,"DSG showed significant statistical correlation with ophthalmologic tests (r=0.87, p=0.00)."
9634,1043,High prevalence of SC in HCV Egyptian patients was detected.
9635,1043,"LIPCOF and DSG are objective and noninvasive methods for early diagnosis of xerophthalmia and assessment of the nasolacrimal drainage, respectively."
9636,1043,Hindrance of lacrimal drainage proved by DSG was frequently encountered in HCV patients with SC (100%) and strongly correlated with xerophthalmia.
9637,1044,"An 80-year-old man presented with a mildly decreased renal function and increased anti-double-stranded-DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels, and met the diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)."
9638,1044,"However, the incremental increase in creatinine levels and the mild proteinuria were inconsistent with lupus nephritis."
9639,1044,"We performed a renal biopsy, which revealed interstitial nephritis and minor glomerular abnormalities."
9640,1044,Further examinations determined that the renal lesion was due to Sjgren's syndrome secondary to SLE.
9641,1044,"Following treatment with oral prednisolone, the patient's renal function improved as his anti-dsDNA antibody levels decreased."
9642,1044,"This case report indicates that renal biopsy should be considered even in elderly individuals when it may assist in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the patient."
9643,1045,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were (1) to assess the effect of rituximab (RTX; anti-CD20) treatment in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) based on sequential parotid biopsies obtained in a placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial, and (2) to assess the prognostic value of the histological characteristics of parotid gland tissue with regard to responsiveness to RTX treatment."
9644,1045,"METHODS: In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, sequential parotid gland biopsies were taken from 20 RTX-treated and 10 placebo-treated patients with pSS, at baseline and 12weeks after treatment."
9645,1045,"The relative amount of lymphocytic infiltrate (stained for CD45), absolute number of T cells and B cells per mm(2) parenchyma (stained for CD3 and CD20, respectively), focus score, number of germinal centres and of lymphoepithelial lesions per mm(2) in parotid gland parenchyma were assessed."
9646,1045,Histopathological data were compared between clinical responders (decrease in European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) score of 3 at 12weeks compared with baseline) and non-responders (change in ESSDAI<3) to RTX treatment.
9647,1045,"RESULTS: In RTX-treated patients, a significant reduction in the number of CD20+ B cells/mm(2) parenchyma was observed, while no such reduction was observed in placebo-treated patients."
9648,1045,The number of CD3+ T cells/mm(2) in parenchyma did not change in either group.
9649,1045,"Furthermore, the number and the severity of lymphoepithelial lesions/mm(2) and number of germinal centres/mm(2) was significantly reduced in RTX-treated patients, but did not change in placebo-treated patients."
9650,1045,"When comparing the pretreatment characteristics of clinical responders with non-responders, the median number of CD20+ B cells/mm(2) parenchyma at baseline was significantly higher in responders (1871 vs 353 cells/mm(2), p<0.05)."
9651,1045,Other histopathological baseline characteristics were not predictive for response to RTX treatment.
9652,1045,"CONCLUSIONS: RTX treatment in pSS leads to a major reduction of lymphocytic infiltration and to fewer B cells, germinal centres and lymphoepithelial lesions in parotid gland parenchyma."
9653,1045,A high pretreatment number of CD20+ B cells/mm(2) parotid gland parenchyma predicts better responsiveness of patients with pSS to RTX treatment.
9654,1045,Pretreatment parotid gland histopathological characteristics could therefore contribute to a more personalised treatment approach to pSS.
9655,1046,This study compared the performance of the newly proposed 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria to the 2002 American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and 2012 ACR classification criteria for primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) in well-characterized Korean patients.
9656,1046,Patients with pSS from 12 university-affiliated hospitals in Korea were enrolled from October 2013 to January 2017.
9657,1046,Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed.
9658,1046,"For the validation set, patients who underwent evaluation tests to rule out pSS at Seoul St. Mary's hospital from November 2016 to December 2017 were analyzed."
9659,1046,"Baseline registry data were available in 458 patients, and 328 patients had sufficient data to determine the fulfillment of each criteria set."
9660,1046,All three sets of criteria were met by 307 patients (93.6%).
9661,1046,The newly proposed 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria were met by 325 patients (99.1%).
9662,1046,"The 2002 AECG and 2012 ACR criteria were met by 325 (99.1%) and 310 patients (94.5%), respectively."
9663,1046,"In a validation cohort consisting of 161 patients with pSS-related symptoms/signs, the sensitivity and specificity of the 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria were 100% [95% confidence interval (CI), 96.11-100.00] and 81.8% [95% CI, 76.15-94.26], respectively."
9664,1046,"Agreement between the 2016 criteria and 2012 or 2002 criteria was high (Cohen's kappa 0.736 and 0.769, respectively)."
9665,1046,The newly proposed 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria were met by most patients diagnosed with pSS according to previous criteria and showed higher sensitivity and lower specificity compared with both previous criteria sets.
9666,1047,"PURPOSE: To demonstrate the conjunctival alterations in patients with Sjgren's (SSDE) and non-Sjgren's syndrome dry eye (NSSDE) using a new generation confocal microscope (HRTII/ RCM; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany), in a prospective controlled study."
9667,1047,"METHODS: Twenty-eight right eyes of 28 patients with SSDE (28 women; mean age, 58.2 +/- 14.3 years), 7 right eyes of patients with NSSDE (7 women; mean age, 66.1 +/- 14.4 years), and 14 right eyes of 14 age- and sex-matched control subjects were studied."
9668,1047,"All subjects underwent the Schirmer test, tear film breakup time (BUT), vital staining, and confocal microscopy of the temporal bulbar conjunctiva."
9669,1047,"The density of conjunctival epithelial cells, epithelial microcysts, and conjunctival and corneal inflammatory infiltrates were also assessed."
9670,1047,"RESULTS: The tear quantity, stability, and vital staining scores were significantly worse in patients with SSDE or NSSDE than in control subjects (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively)."
9671,1047,Eyes of the patients with SSDE or NSSDE had a significantly higher density of conjunctival and corneal inflammatory infiltrates than did the control eyes (P < 0.001).
9672,1047,Conjunctival inflammatory cell densities showed a negative correlation with tear stability and tear quantity and a positive correlation with the vital staining scores.
9673,1047,Conjunctival epithelial cell densities were significantly lower in SSDE and NSSDE compared with control subjects (P < 0.05).
9674,1047,The density of epithelial cysts was significantly higher in SS than in healthy control eyes (P < 0.001).
9675,1047,"CONCLUSIONS: Confocal scanning laser microscopy was an efficient and a noninvasive tool for the quantitative assessment of the conjunctival inflammation and epithelial cell densities as well as evaluation of conjunctival morphologic alterations, such as microcysts in patients with SSDE and NSSDE dry eye disease."
9676,1048,"OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS)-associated lymphoma in a multicenter cohort of patients, with analysis of the predictive power of previously reported risk factors, including the presence of ectopic germinal center (GC)-like structures in minor salivary gland (MSG) biopsy tissue."
9677,1048,"METHODS: One hundred fifteen patients with primary SS were included, and MSG biopsy tissue from these patients was retrospectively examined, focusing on the presence of ectopic GC-like structures."
9678,1048,"Epidemiologic, clinical, biologic, immunologic, and histologic data were collected at the time of diagnosis of primary SS."
9679,1048,"Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were compared with those without NHL during the follow-up period, using a Cox proportional hazards multiple regression model."
9680,1048,"RESULTS: NHL was diagnosed in 8 patients (6.96%), and ectopic GC-like structures in 19 patients (16.5%)."
9681,1048,The presence of ectopic GC-like structures was associated with a 7.8-fold increased risk of lymphoma occurrence (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.73-34.86 [P = 0.0075]).
9682,1048,"Other independent predictors included a positive cryoglobulin test result (hazard ratio [HR] 7.10, 95% CI 1.74-28.92 [P = 0.006]), male sex (HR 28.73, 95% CI 4.46-144.87 [P = 0.0004]), sensorimotor neuropathy (HR 35.48, 95% CI 5.79-217.39 [P = 0.0001]), and splenomegaly (HR 19.9, 95% CI 4.4-90 [P = 0.0001])."
9683,1048,CONCLUSION: The presence of ectopic GC-like structures in MSG biopsy tissue is associated with the risk of lymphoma in patients with primary SS.
9684,1048,"These data reinforce the major role of MSG biopsy tissue in primary SS, for the identification a priori of a subgroup of patients with the highest risk of lymphoma."
9685,1049,OBJECTIVE: A standardization of minor salivary gland (MSG) histopathology in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) has been recently proposed.
9686,1049,"Although there is strong agreement that germinal center (GC)-like structures should be routinely identified, due to their prognostic value, a consensus regarding the best protocol is still lacking."
9687,1049,Aim of this study was to compare the performance of different histological techniques and operators to identify GC-like structures in pSS MSGs.
9688,1049,MSG biopsies from 50 pSS patients were studied.
9689,1049,"METHODS: Three blinded operators (one pathologist and two rheumatologists with different years of experience in pSS MSG assessment) assessed 50 MSGs of which one slide was stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and consecutive slides were processed to investigate CD3/CD20, CD21 and Bcl-6 expression."
9690,1049,"RESULTS: By assessing 225 foci, the best agreement was between H&E-stained sections evaluated by the rheumatologist with more years of experience in pSS MSG assessment and CD3/CD20 segregation."
9691,1049,"In the foci with CD21 positivity, the agreement further increased."
9692,1049,"Bcl-6- foci could display a GC, detected with other staining, but not vice versa."
9693,1049,"CONCLUSION: GC assessment on H&E-stained sections should be performed with caution, being operator-dependent."
9694,1049,"The combination of H&E with CD3/CD20 and CD21 staining should be recommended as it is reliable, feasible, able to overcome the bias of operator experience and easily transferrable into routine practice."
9695,1050,"OBJECTIVE: To compare systemic disease activity by validated tools, i.e., the European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) and the Clinical ESSDAI (ClinESSDAI) scores, between primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) with positive serum cryoglobulins and pSS without serum cryoglobulins."
9696,1050,METHODS: There were 825 consecutive patients with pSS who were retrospectively evaluated.
9697,1050,"RESULTS: The ESSDAI and the ClinESSDAI scores were significantly higher in cryoglobulin-positive patients (p < 0.0001, for both scores)."
9698,1050,"Cryoglobulinemia was significantly associated with these domains: constitutional (p = 0.003), lymphadenopathy (p = 0.007), glandular (p = 0.0002), cutaneous (p < 0.0001), peripheral nervous system (p < 0.0001), hematological (p = 0.004), and biological (p < 0.0001)."
9699,1050,CONCLUSION: Cryoglobulin-positive patients show the highest systemic activity in pSS.
9700,1051,AIM: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease affecting exocrine glands.
9701,1051,"Both autoreactive T cells and B cells are involved in the development of pSS, but their exact contribution to the pathogenesis is not clear."
9702,1051,"Here, we aimed to investigate the association of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and interleukin (IL)-17A with subphenotypes of pSS."
9703,1051,METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 31 pSS patients and 28 healthy controls.
9704,1051,The serum levels of BAFF and IL-17A were quantified by sandwich ELISA.
9705,1051,"RESULTS: The increased circulating BAFF levels are associated with higher immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels (P=0.0167) and anti-Ro/SS antigen A autoantibody (P=0.032), while the elevated circulating levels of IL-17A are associated with lower C3 levels (P=0.0213) and higher focus score of salivary gland tissue (P=0.002)."
9706,1051,"CONCLUSION: Our results show that BAFF and IL-17A are associated with different subphenotypes of pSS, suggesting both humoral and cellular immune response are involved in the pathogenesis of pSS."
9707,1052,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate systemic involvement in primary SS in a large cohort of Spanish patients using the EULAR-SS disease activity index (ESSDAI) definitions.
9708,1052,"METHODS: Systemic involvement was characterized using ESSDAI definitions for the 10 clinical domains (constitutional, lymphadenopathy, glandular, articular, cutaneous, pulmonary, renal, peripheral nervous system, central nervous system and muscular)."
9709,1052,"ESSDAI scores at diagnosis, during follow-up and cumulated at the last visit were calculated."
9710,1052,RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 921 patients.
9711,1052,"After a mean follow-up of 75 months, 77 (8%) patients still had an ESSDAI score of zero at the last visit."
9712,1052,"Organ by organ, the percentage of patients who developed activity during the follow-up (ESSDAI score  1 at any time) ranged between 1.4% and 56%, with articular, pulmonary and peripheral neurological involvement being the most common."
9713,1052,"Logistic multivariate regression analysis showed the following features at diagnosis and had the closest association with systemic activity (statistically significant independent variables in at least two domains): cryoglobulinaemia in five domains; anaemia, lymphopenia and low C3 levels in three domains each and age <35 years in two domains."
9714,1052,"Sicca features, ANA and RF at diagnosis were not associated with a higher cumulated activity score in any clinical domain."
9715,1052,"CONCLUSION: Primary SS is undeniably a systemic disease, with the joints, lungs, skin and peripheral nerves being the most frequently involved organs."
9716,1052,"Cytopenias, hypocomplementaemia and cryoglobulinaemia at diagnosis strongly correlated with higher cumulated ESSDAI scores in the clinical domains."
9717,1052,Clinically the ESSDAI provides a reliable picture of systemic involvement in primary SS.
9718,1053,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is an important cause of renal tubular dysfunction in adults, mainly due to acquired type 1 distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA 1) and concentration defects (CD)."
9719,1053,"This cross-sectional study evaluated renal tubular function of patients with pSS, by detecting proximal tubular injury (through measurements of urinary 2 microglobulin and albumin), RTA 1 (through an acidification protocol using furosemide and fludrocortisone), and CD (through water deprivation test, WDT)."
9720,1053,"A total of 25 patients with pSS were evaluated and despite a preserved renal function (eGFR 92.5  26.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), 24% were diagnosed as RTA 1."
9721,1053,"On the other hand, CD was diagnosed in 28% of the patients who presented worse renal function (eGFR 68.6  27.7 mL/min/1.73 m(2))."
9722,1053,"Increased 2 microglobulin was found in 16% of the patients, and all of them had impaired renal function (eGFR 39.5  11.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2))."
9723,1053,"These data showed a high prevalence of tubular dysfunction, mainly RTA 1 and CD, in patients with pSS, and suggest that patients with this disorder should be evaluated by the acidification protocol used in this study and WDT for proper diagnosis."
9724,1053,"Proximal tubular injury was less common, and probably associated with worsening of renal function."
9725,1054,Primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the exocrine (salivary and lachrymal) glands that results in sicca symptoms (dryness of the eyes and mouth).
9726,1054,"Systemic complications can occur in pSS, but renal involvement is rare, affecting <10% patients."
9727,1054,"The most frequent form of nephropathy in pSS is tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), in which infiltration of the kidney by plasma cells is a key feature and shows similarity to the lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the salivary glands."
9728,1054,"Electrolyte disturbances may occur in pSS, such as renal distal tubular acidosis, diabetes insipidus, Gitelman syndrome or Fanconi syndrome."
9729,1054,"Glomerular involvement is less frequently detected in patients with pSS, but usually takes the form of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis secondary to cryoglobulinaemia."
9730,1054,"The renal prognosis in patients with pSS and TIN or glomerular disease is usually favourable, but the risk of chronic kidney disease remains high in patients with TIN."
9731,1054,Appropriate screening must be performed at least once a year in patients with systemic pSS in order to facilitate the early detection of renal complications.
9732,1054,"In this Review we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis and treatment of renal disease in pSS."
9733,1055,"In the course of pSS, inflammatory cell infiltration consists mainly of lymphocytes infiltrating exocrine glands, which leads to their impaired function."
9734,1055,The characteristic feature is generalized dryness.
9735,1055,The aim of this study was to attempt to answer the question whether it is possible to distinguish between patients with pSS and individuals with dryness caused by other pathologies without applying invasive studies.
9736,1055,The study included 68 patients with pSS and 43 healthy controls with dryness.
9737,1055,"FS1 was observed in 90% of patients with pSS (with or without dryness), and only in 23% of the control group (only with xerostomia)."
9738,1055,"In the pSS group, anaemia (p = 0.0085), lymphocytopenia (p = 0.0006), elevated ERS (p = 0.001), higher RF titer, and ANA antibodies were noted."
9739,1055,Configuration of anti-SSA+SSB+Ro52 antibodies was characteristic for the pSS group.
9740,1055,"Considering the clinical symptoms, statistically significant differences were noted between pSS patients and the control group in frequency (p = 0.02) and severity (p = 0.042) of fatigue, lymphadenopathy, major salivary gland involvement, and photosensitivity to UV light."
9741,1055,"In conclusion, invasive methods are pivotal in pSS diagnosis in this salivary gland biopsy."
9742,1055,Chronic fatigue syndrome is more common in pSS patients and can be subjective distinguishing factor in the group of people with dryness.
9743,1056,PURPOSE: To evaluate lower tear meniscus and corneal sub-basal nerve plexus in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and Sicca syndrome patients.
9744,1056,METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 116 patients with Sicca syndrome associated with pSS and not associated with Sjgren's syndrome (non-SS Sicca) and 20 normal control subjects.
9745,1056,"Tear meniscus height and area were measured using anterior segment optical coherence tomography; corneal sub-basal nerve plexus density, length, and tortuosity were evaluated using in vivo confocal microscopy."
9746,1056,Data analysis was performed using IBM-SPSS Statistics 24.0.
9747,1056,"RESULTS: Corneal sub-basal nerve plexus density and length were significantly lower, and tortuosity was significantly higher in pSS and non-SS Sicca groups than in normal control subjects (P < 0.001; P = 0.018, respectively)."
9748,1056,Corneal sub-basal nerve plexus presented a strong association with Schirmer test I and tear breakup time.
9749,1056,Cutoff values of sub-basal nerve plexus density (36.5 nerve/mm) and length (12.5 mm/mm) presented 80.2% to 81.9% sensitivity and 85% specificity for detecting Sicca syndrome patients.
9750,1056,No significant differences were found between the 3 groups regarding tear meniscus height and area.
9751,1056,"CONCLUSIONS: Corneal sub-basal nerve plexus in vivo confocal microscopy may be a useful tool in the assessment of dry eye disease in Sicca syndrome, complementing the information provided by the conventional modalities used in dry eye disease evaluation."
9752,1057,INTRODUCTION: There is evidence that interferon is involved in the pathogenesis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
9753,1057,"The interferon-inducible IFI16 protein, normally expressed in cell nuclei, may be overexpressed, mislocalized in the cytoplasm and secreted in the extracellular milieu in several autoimmune disorders."
9754,1057,This leads to tolerance breaking to this self-protein with consequent development of anti-IFI16 antibodies.
9755,1057,The aim of this study was to identify the pathogenic and clinical significance of IFI16 and anti-IFI16 in pSS.
9756,1057,METHODS: IFI16 and anti-IFI16 were assessed in the serum of 67 pSS patients and over 100 healthy donors by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
9757,1057,"IFI16 was also evaluated by immunohistochemistry in minor salivary glands of 15 pSS patients and 10 subjects with sicca symptoms but without any clinical, serological or histological features of pSS."
9758,1057,RESULTS: pSS patients display higher serum levels of both IFI16 and anti-IFI16 compared to healthy donors.
9759,1057,IFI16 concentration was directly correlated with disease duration and focus score and inversely correlated with age at diagnosis.
9760,1057,"Moreover, IFI16 positivity was associated with concurrent positivity for rheumatoid factor."
9761,1057,"Interestingly, the direct correlation between IFI16 positivity and focus score was independent of disease duration and age at diagnosis."
9762,1057,pSS minor salivary glands display marked expression and cytoplasmic mislocalization of IFI16 by acinar and ductal epithelial cells as well as infiltrating lymphocytes and peri/intralesional endothelium compared to minor salivary glands with normal architecture or nonspecific chronic sialadenitis.
9763,1057,"Within the mononuclear cell infiltrate, IFI16 expression appears to parallel the distribution of T lymphocytes."
9764,1057,CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the IFI16 protein may be involved in the pathogenesis of glandular inflammation occurring in pSS.
9765,1058,"Sjgren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease that, apart from exocrine glands, may affect every organ or system."
9766,1058,Involvement of different sections of the peripheral nervous system results in a wide spectrum of neuropathic manifestations.
9767,1058,"Based on distinct clinical, electrophysiological and histological criteria, the types of neuropathies seen in Sjgren's syndrome include: a) pure sensory which presents with distal symmetric sensory loss due to axonal degeneration of sensory fibers; sensory ataxia due to loss of proprioceptive large fibers (ganglionopathy); or with painful dysethesias (small fiber sensory neuropathy) due to degeneration of cutaneous axons."
9768,1058,"The latter appears to be the most common neuropathy in Sjgren's syndrome and requires skin biopsy for diagnosis to document loss or reduction of nerve fiber density; b) sensorimotor polyneuropathy affecting sensory and motor axons, often associated with severe systemic or pro-lymhomatous manifestations, such as palpable purpura and cryoglobulinemia, and c) rare types that include autoimmune demyelinating neuropathy, mononeuropathy, mononeuropathy multiplex and autonomic neuropathy."
9769,1058,"In this review, the frequency, prevalence and diagnostic criteria for each neuropathy subset are discussed and possible pathogenetic mechanisms are outlined."
9770,1059,"Sjgren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by immune- mediated injury of exocrine glands, as well as a diverse array of extraglandular manifestations."
9771,1059,"B cell over-activation is a key feature of the disease, attested by the wide spectrum of autoantibodies detected in these patients."
9772,1059,"Up to date, anti- Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies are traditional biomarkers for disease classification and diagnosis."
9773,1059,"On the other hand, the detection of novel autoantibodies in SS has increased in the last years, opening a window of opportunity to denote particular stages of the disease, to establish clinical phenotypes, and to predict long-term complications such as lymphoma."
9774,1059,"For instance, anti-SP-1, anti-CA6 and anti-PSP antibodies occur in an earlier stage than anti-Ro/La antibodies, and may identify a subset of primary Sjgren's syndrome patients with mild or incomplete disease, whereas anti-cofilin-1, anti- alpha-enolase and anti-RGI2 antibodies are potential biomarkers of MALT lymphoma."
9775,1059,"Antibody detection is also important to elucidate new aspects of SS pathophysiology, and in the future to permit a phenotype-specific patient approach."
9776,1059,"Herein we review the literature regarding new autoantibodies in SS and attempt to dissect their usefulness as diagnostic tools, pathogenic role, identification of clinical phenotypes and as predictors of an overlap syndrome."
9777,1060,"A 68-year-old woman was admitted to our institution's respiratory section because of dyspnea on effort in January, 2007."
9778,1060,She had previously received a diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome because of dryness in her eyes in 1991.
9779,1060,Chest radiography and chest CT in 2001 revealed diffuse multiple cystic lesions in both lungs which had progressed gradually for 6 years.
9780,1060,Biopsy specimens obtained by video-assisted thoracoscopy showed lymphoid hyperplasia with follicular bronchiolitis and lymphocytic alveolitis.
9781,1060,Narrowing of the small airways and obstructive lung disease with multiple bullae were observed and we suspected them to be related to peribronchiolar lymphocytic infiltration.
9782,1060,These were lung involvements associated with Sjgren's syndrome.
9783,1060,The patient's cystic lesions gradually worsened despite the administration of corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide.
9784,1060,Cystic lesions in Sjgren's syndrome may be a treatment-resistant finding.
9785,1061,We experienced a case of a 63-year-old woman with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) complicated with inflammatory myopathy and interstitial lung disease (ILD).
9786,1061,She had suffered from morning stiffness and dry mouth for 1 year without being medically examined.
9787,1061,A chest CT scan demonstrated ground glass opacity and a reticular shadow in the lower lung field.
9788,1061,"A diagnosis of SS was made based on positive findings from Schirmer's test, sialography of the parotid gland, a labial salivary gland biopsy and the presence of anti-SS-A antibody."
9789,1061,"Musculoskeletal symptoms were absent; however, the elevation of creatine kinase (CK) as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-proven inflammatory change of bilateral muscles of the thigh was evident."
9790,1061,"Histological examination of the thigh revealed diameter variation, degeneration of muscle fibers and inflammatory cell infiltration in the perivascular area, corresponding to the inflammatory myopathy of pSS."
9791,1061,"Oral prednisolone 30 mg/day was introduced, and serum CK rapidly decreased within 2 weeks."
9792,1061,ILD also responded well to prednisolone without relapse.
9793,1061,These clinical outcomes are consistent with extraglandular organ involvement of pSS.
9794,1062,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) levels and clinical and laboratory parameters reflecting expression of disease between female patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and age-matched healthy women and to examine in pSS patients the correlation of these variables with fatigue, well-being, and functioning."
9795,1062,METHODS: Comparisons were made between 60 female pSS patients and 60 age-matched healthy women.
9796,1062,"We assessed questionnaire scores of general fatigue, depressed mood, mental wellbeing, and physical functioning, tear production (Schirmer I test), tender point counts, serum DHEAS level, haemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum immunoglobulin G. RESULTS: As compared to healthy participants, patients had more fatigue and depressed mood, reduced well-being and functioning, more dryness and pain, lower serum DHEAS levels, and more expression of disease as reflected by laboratory assessments (p0.001)."
9797,1062,"In pSS patients, fatigue, well-being, and functioning correlated with tender point counts, but not with the extent of dryness and also not with laboratory assessments including serum DHEAS levels."
9798,1062,CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of fatigue and reduced functioning in pSS patients might suggest a mediating role of generalised autoimmune processes.
9799,1062,"In the present study, clinical observations and laboratory assessments are not correlated with persistent fatigue and reduced functioning."
9800,1062,"Our results suggest that treatment of fatigue, well-being, and functioning, should target other variables than those examined in this study, preferably psychological variables or perhaps specific immunologic parameters."
9801,1063,"Sjogren's syndrome (SS), a chronic autoimmune disease, typically causes or involves inflammation in the salivary and lacrimal glands."
9802,1063,"Although recent genetic association studies have contributed to the discovery of SS susceptible genes, few studies have reported on the Korean population."
9803,1063,"Here, we did a genetic association study of SS in Korean patients using whole-exome sequencing data of 15 patients and 100 healthy controls."
9804,1063,"In addition to confirming previously described SS susceptibility loci MSH5 (p=1.6710-5) and RELN (p=4.9110-6), we also validated PRAMEF13 (p=2.2810-5), TARBP1 (p=1.8710-5), UGT2B28 (p=1.3310-5), TRBV5-6 (p=2.2710-5) and NAPB (p=3.7310-5) as novel susceptibility loci for SS."
9805,1063,"Furthermore, we identified UGT2B28, TARBP1 and PRAMEF13 as associated with human immune function."
9806,1063,These findings may provide useful insight into to the pathways and pathogenesis contributing to SS susceptibility in the Korean population.
9807,1064,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of low-dose rituximab (RTX) for patients in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) with thrombocytopenia.
9808,1064,"METHODS: Four pSS patients, 2 with refractory thrombocytopenia and 2 with glucocorticoid-dependent thrombocytopenia, were treated with rituximab at 100 mg, intravenous, weekly for a total of two cycles, together with prednisone 1 - 2 mgkg(-1)d(-1), and the counts of platelets and B-cells were evaluated."
9809,1064,RESULTS: Efficacy of treatment was observed in all patients.
9810,1064,"The counts of platelets, at (3 - 39)  10(9)/L baseline, increased in 1 - 2 weeks, and went up to (107 - 241)  10(9)/L in 3 - 8 weeks."
9811,1064,Sustained remission had been achieved for 27 - 52 weeks.
9812,1064,The doses of prednisone were tappered to 3.75 - 7.50 mg/day in 12 weeks.
9813,1064,"One patient who relapsed at the 27th week (platelet count 47  10(9)/L), was retreated with 100 mg of RTX and still had good efficacy."
9814,1064,"The counts of B-cells reduced to (0.007 - 0.010)  10(9)/L, but they did not achieved the depletion."
9815,1064,There were no severe adverse events during RTX therapy.
9816,1064,CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown good efficacy and tolerability of low-dose RTX for pSS with thrombocytopenia.
9817,1064,"Low-dose RTX allows for reduction in corticosteroid doses and B-cells, while large-scale randomized double-blind controlled trials are needed to confirm the results."
9818,1065,"OBJECTIVES: Herein, we investigate the presence and prognostic value of autoantibodies against carbamylated proteins (anti-CarP) in the serum of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
9819,1065,"PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum levels of anti-CarP antibodies were measured in Norwegian patients with pSS (n=78) and corresponding controls (n=74) using ELISA and analysed in relation with exocrine gland function, degree of salivary gland inflammation, signs of ectopic germinal centre (GC) formation and immunological markers."
9820,1065,"For univariate comparisons, the Mann-Whitney U test and (2) or Fisher's exact tests were used."
9821,1065,Correlations were assessed with Spearman's rank testing.
9822,1065,Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the effect of anti-CarP positivity on clinical manifestations.
9823,1065,"RESULTS: Of the patients with pSS, 27% were positive for anti-CarP IgG antibodies."
9824,1065,"Levels of anti-CarP correlated positively with total IgG, IgM, rheumatoid factor and 2-microglobulin."
9825,1065,"Importantly, after adjusting for confounding factors, patients positive for anti-CarP had significantly higher focus score."
9826,1065,"Furthermore, positive anti-CarP status coincided with 9.2-fold higher odds of having developed GC-like structures in the minor salivary glands."
9827,1065,"As a patient group considered having worse disease outcome, individuals with ectopic GC-like structures also presented with significantly higher levels of anti-CarP antibodies."
9828,1065,"CONCLUSIONS: Presence of anti-CarP in patients with pSS is strongly associated with increased focal lymphocytic infiltration, formation of ectopic GC-like structures in minor salivary glands, and diminished salivary gland function."
9829,1065,Even taking into consideration our relatively small cohort we believe that anti-CarP antibodies offer new possibilities for identifying patients with more active disease and at risk of developing additional comorbidity.
9830,1066,Glomerular involvement in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) has rarely been reported.
9831,1066,"Among them, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and membranous nephropathy are the more common types."
9832,1066,"We report a middle-aged female presenting concurrently with nephrotic syndrome and microscopic hematuria, and her pSS was diagnosed by positive anti-Ro (SSA)/anti-La (SSB) autoantibodies, dry mouth, severely diffuse impaired function of both bilateral parotid and submandibular glands, and a positive Schirmer test."
9833,1066,Renal pathology revealed minimal change disease and thin basement membrane nephropathy.
9834,1066,The patient's nephrotic syndrome resolved after treatment with corticosteroids.
9835,1066,"To our knowledge, this is the first report of minimal change disease in a patient with pSS."
9836,1067,"To determine the prevalence of pulmonary complications in primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS), and to identify the risk factors and the prognosis associated with pulmonary involvement in pSS patients.A total of 1341 hospitalized patients (853 with pSS and 488 with secondary Sjgren syndrome [sSS]) were retrospectively reviewed."
9837,1067,"Of these, 165 hospitalized patients with pSS-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) were analyzed and recruited as a study group."
9838,1067,Eighty-four pSS patients without organ damage were included as a control group.One hundred and sixty-five patients (19.34%) from the pSS group and 126 patients (25.82%) from the sSS group presented with lung involvement.
9839,1067,"Of the 165 pSS patients with lung complications, 151 (91.5%) were women."
9840,1067,"The mean age was 61.259.79 years, and the median disease duration was 84 (24-156) months."
9841,1067,Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; 39.1%) was the predominant pattern on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).
9842,1067,The total HRCT score was 9.714.77.
9843,1067,Impairment in diffusion capacity was the most common (74.3%) and severe complication (predicted value of TLCO was 57.521.2%).
9844,1067,The 5-year survival rate for all patients with pSS-ILD was 88.5%.
9845,1067,"Age, disease duration, rheumatoid factor (RF), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher than in controls, whereas anti-SSA was less common."
9846,1067,"Age, RF, and CRP were independent predictors of ILD after adjustment for confounders.Lung involvement is a common and severe complication of Sjgren syndrome."
9847,1067,Age and disease activity are correlated with pulmonary involvement in pSS patients.
9848,1068,OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic value of salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) for IgG4-related sialadenitis.
9849,1068,"METHODS: Ultrasonography examination of major salivary glands was conducted for 48 IgG4-related sialadenitis patients and 50 Sjgren's syndrome patients, whose ages and disease duration were matched."
9850,1068,"The imaging features were graded using two different scoring systems (0-16 and 0-48, respectively) obtained from the grades of bilateral parotid and submandibular glands."
9851,1068,The scores were used to further evaluate the features of salivary gland ultrasonography in IgG4-related sialadenitis and to compare them with Sjgren's syndrome patients.
9852,1068,The association of SGUS scores of IgG4-related sialadenitis group with serological tests was analyzed.
9853,1068,"RESULTS: The mean age of IgG4-related sialadenitis group and Sjgren's syndrome group was 49.23 years and 50.44 years, respectively."
9854,1068,"The serum IgG4 level of the patients in the IgG4-related sialadenitis group was increased, with an average (9.606.43) g/L."
9855,1068,And the serum IgE level was at a median of 251.5 (123.4-543.6) IU/mL.
9856,1068,"In the 0-16 system, the scores of submandibular glands of the patients in IgG4-related sialadenitis and Sjgren's syndrome were 6.0 (6.0-8.0) and 4.0 (2.0-8.0), and the scores of the total four glands were 10.0 (8.0-14.0) and 8.0 (4.0-12.0) respectively."
9857,1068,"In the 0-48 system, the scores of submandibular glands with IgG4-related sialadenitis and Sjgren's syndrome were 18.0 (14.5-20.0) and 11.0 (7.0-14.0), and the scores of the total four glands were 26.0 (18.5-34.0) and 21.5 (15.0-26.3) respectively."
9858,1068,"It suggested that in the 0-16 system and the 0-48 system, scores of submandibular glands and the total of four glands of IgG4-related sialadenitis were higher than those of Sjgren's syndrome."
9859,1068,"Meanwhile, the association analysis of 0-48 system showed a positive correlation of SGUS scores with serum IgG4, which also showed a positive correlation of SGUS scores with serum IgE in 0-16 system."
9860,1068,"CONCLUSION: Semi-quantitative ultrasonography scoring systems can evaluate and quantify the lesions of salivary glands, which can be helpful in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of IgG4-related sialadenitis combined with the clinical manifestations, serological indicators and/or histopathological manifestations."
9861,1068,Ultrasonography can also assess the activity of IgG4-related sialadenitis preliminarily.
9862,1069,"BACKGROUND: The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) has been used to assess parotid gland abnormalities in Sjgren's syndrome (SS) patients; however, few data exist on the influence of region of interest (ROI) methods on ADC measurements."
9863,1069,"PURPOSE: To assess the influence of ROI methods on ADC measurement, and their diagnostic ability in detecting parotid gland abnormalities in early SS patients."
9864,1069,MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen early SS patients underwent parotid gland diffusion-weighted imaging scans at a 3.0T MR unit.
9865,1069,"Two readers independently measured the parotid gland ADC value using three different ROIs (whole-gland [WG], single-slice [SS], and reader-based circular [RBC])."
9866,1069,"The ADC value based on three different ROIs (ADC-ROI(WG), ADC-ROI(SS), ADC-ROI(RBC)) were compared between the SS group and a matched healthy control (HC) group (n=19)."
9867,1069,Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to determine the diagnostic ability and reproducibility of the parameters.
9868,1069,"RESULTS: The ADC-ROI(WG), ADC-ROI(SS), and ADC-ROI(RBC) in the SS group were all significantly higher than those in HC group (all P<0.05)."
9869,1069,"The ADC-ROI(WG) showed better diagnostic ability than did ADC-ROI(RBC) (P=0.0200), while no significant difference was found between ADC-ROI(WG) and ADC-ROI(SS) (P=0.4636)."
9870,1069,"The ROI(WG) method showed the best inter- and intra-reader agreement (ICC, 0.902 and 0.928, respectively), followed by ROI(SS) and ROI(RBC)."
9871,1069,CONCLUSION: The ROI methods can influence the parotid gland ADC measurements and their diagnostic ability.
9872,1069,"Considering our results, we suggest using in clinical practice single-slice ROIs to measure the ADC of the parotid gland."
9873,1070,"Skin lesions occur, often at very early stages, in many of the most frequent inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis (DM), systemic sclerosis (SSc), Sjgren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and psoriatic arthritis."
9874,1070,"It is important to recognize the different specific cutaneous lesions in SLE (e.g., ""butterfly"" rash in acute, annular or psoriasiform photosensitive lesions in the subacute form, and discoid lesions in the chronic form) for an early diagnosis and to estimate the associated risks of internal disease, whereas nonspecific lesions (exanthema, vasculitis, and alopecia) can be part of SLE flares."
9875,1070,"Cutaneous lesions in DM (Gottron's papules and sign, heliotrope rash, dystrophic cuticles, and nailfold capillary abnormalities) may occur before any clinically evident muscular or systemic organ involvement and are of utmost importance for early diagnosis."
9876,1070,"The pattern of cutaneous lesions and associated autoantibodies also allow the distinction of different phenotypes, either more prone to life-threatening interstitial lung disease (MDA-5) or with higher risk for neoplasia (TIF1-)."
9877,1070,"Many other skin lesions, although not specific, require further investigation to look for a possible underlying inflammatory rheumatic disease: non-pruritic urticarial lesions in anti-C1q-associated urticarial vasculitis, Still's disease or hereditary auto-inflammatory syndromes, transient macular purpura of vasculitis in Sjgren's syndrome, Behet's disease, or RA, Raynaud's phenomenon in SSc and mixed connective tissue disease, erythema nodosum or other panniculitis in RA, Behet's disease and SLE, pustular eruptions in Behet's disease, psoriasis, and hereditary auto-inflammatory syndromes."
9878,1070,"After reviewing in detail the cutaneous manifestations of the most frequent inflammatory rheumatic diseases, we describe a topographic and morphological approach to skin rashes, calling attention to facial rashes, hand involvement, scalp, nail, or leg lesions or to some morphological aspects of skin lesions (annular, pustular, urticarial, or exanthematous) that may be the initial manifestations of inflammatory rheumatic diseases."
9879,1070,The importance of skin lesions is confirmed by their presence as part of the classification criteria of many inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
9880,1070,"They also contribute to early diagnosis, to characterize disease phenotypes, to aid in effective patient management, and, ultimately, to impact on disease prognosis."
9881,1071,Abstract Objective.
9882,1071,To assess the efficacy and safety of abatacept for secondary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
9883,1071,Methods.
9884,1071,"The primary endpoint of this 1-year, open-labeled, prospective, observational multicenter study of RA-associated secondary SS was the rate of SDAI remission at 52 weeks after initiation of abatacept therapy."
9885,1071,The secondary endpoints included that of Saxson's test and Schirmer's test.
9886,1071,Adverse events during the study period were also analyzed.
9887,1071,Results.
9888,1071,Thirty-two patients (all females) were enrolled in this study.
9889,1071,Interim analysis at 24 weeks included assessment of efficacy (n = 31) and safety (n = 32).
9890,1071,The mean SDAI decreased from 19.8  11.0 ( SD) at baseline to 9.9  9.9 at 24 weeks (P < 0.05).
9891,1071,"Patients with clinical remission, as assessed by SDAI, increased from 0 patient (0 week) to 8 patients (25.8%) at 24 weeks."
9892,1071,Saliva volume (assessed by Saxson's test) increased slightly from 2232  1908 (0 week) to 2424  2004 (24 weeks) mg/2 min (n = 29).
9893,1071,"In 11 patients with Greenspan grading 1/2 of labial salivary glands biopsy, saliva volume increased from 2945  2090 (0 week) to 3419  2121 (24 weeks) mg/2 min (P < 0.05)."
9894,1071,Schirmer's test for tear volume showed increase from 3.6  4.6 (0 week) to 5.5  7.1 (24 weeks) mm/5 min (n = 25; P < 0.05).
9895,1071,"Five adverse events occurred in five of 32 patients (15.6%), and three of these events were infections."
9896,1071,Conclusion.
9897,1071,Abatacept seems to be effective for both RA and RA-related secondary SS.
9898,1072,Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma arising from the thymus is extremely rare.
9899,1072,Only 33 cases of thymic MALT lymphoma have been reported to date.
9900,1072,We present the case of a 53-year-old Japanese woman with Sjgren's syndrome who was diagnosed with thymic MALT lymphoma.
9901,1072,"In addition, the patient had the characteristic clinical and pathological features of thymic MALT lymphoma, as found in most of the 33 previous cases, except that there was an immunoglobulin G (IgG) phenotype, i.e."
9902,1072,"Sjgren's syndrome, epithelial cysts, lymphoepithelial lesions, and marked plasmacytic differentiation."
9903,1072,The serum IgA levels were also elevated with IgA kappa M protein.
9904,1072,This hypergammaglobulinemia remained unchanged after operation.
9905,1072,The serological abnormalities may not arise from MALT lymphoma itself and may arise from the immune system hyper-reactivity evoked by Sjgren's syndrome.
9906,1072,Of further interest were marked accumulations of CD68-positive histiocytes containing abundant eosinophilic globular inclusions in their cytoplasm.
9907,1072,"These inclusions were immunopositive for IgG-kappa, suggesting immunoglobulin inclusion bodies."
9908,1072,The globular immunoglobulin inclusion bodies have been reported in non-crystallized immunoglobulin-storing histiocytosis in only one patient with multiple myeloma.
9909,1072,"To our knowledge, this is the first case of thymic MALT lymphoma with marked accumulation of histiocytes with immunoglobulin inclusions in a patient with Sjgren's syndrome."
9910,1073,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the differential expression of miR-17-92 cluster, which encodes 6 microRNAs (miR-NAs) including miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-92a, among varying histological stages of labial minor salivary gland (MSG) tis- sues in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
9911,1073,METHODS: Fifty-seven pSS patients and 13 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study.
9912,1073,The pSS patients were allocated to 3 subgroups of advanced clinical stages according to the histological findings of the MSG biopsies.
9913,1073,"Salivary flow rate, Schirmer test and some laboratory indexes were also tested."
9914,1073,The expression levels of the 6 miRNAs in MSG were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with TaqMan miRNA assay.
9915,1073,"RESULTS: The differences between the healthy individuals and the 3 pSS subgroups were statistically significant for positive findings of salivary flow rate, Schirmer test and laboratory indexes."
9916,1073,"In the labial MSG tissues, we observed that the expression level of miR-18a was significantly up-regulated in patients of the 3 pSS subgroups compared to healthy individuals, while the expression level of miR-92a was significantly down-regulated."
9917,1073,"We also observed that there was no notable difference in the expression levels of miR-17, miR-19a, miR-19b, and miR-20a."
9918,1073,"Furthermore, we distinguished that miR-18a was progressively up-regulated along the advanced histological stages of the 3 pSS subgroups, while the miR-92a was progressively down-regulated."
9919,1073,CONCLUDIONS: This is the first study on the expression of the miR-17-92 cluster in MSG of pSS patients.
9920,1073,The association of increased expression levels of miR-18a and reduced expression levels of miR-92a with advanced clinical stages of pSS could significantly reduce the substantial subjectivity of scoring inflammatory infiltrates and may aid in the diagnosis of pSS.
9921,1074,OBJECTIVE: SS is an autoimmune disease characterized by salivary and lacrimal gland dysfunction leading to dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (xerophthalmia).
9922,1074,Anti-muscarinic acetylcholine type-3 receptor (anti-M3R) autoantibodies have been shown to be a good serum marker in primary SS (pSS).
9923,1074,The aim of this study was to assess the clinical correlations of anti-M3R-derived peptide antibodies in patients with pSS.
9924,1074,METHODS: Sequences of the first to fourth cycle-M3R (c1M3R-c4M3R)-derived peptide was synthesized by a solid-phase technique on an Applied Biosytems Peptide Synthesizer.
9925,1074,Synthesized cM3R peptide (cM3RP) was used as substrate in an ELISA to detect IgG anti-cM3RP antibodies in serum samples of patients and controls.
9926,1074,The clinical and biological parameters of the diseases were also evaluated.
9927,1074,The EULAR SS disease activity index (ESSDAI) score was used to measure disease activity in patients with primary SS.
9928,1074,"RESULTS: (i) Anti-c2M3RP antibodies were highly prevalent in pSS patients, and the titre is much higher than anti-c1,3,4M3RP antibodies."
9929,1074,"(ii) The prevalence of anti-c2M3RP antibodies in pSS, SLE, RA and healthy controls was 62.2, 7.1, 5.3 and 1.6%, respectively."
9930,1074,"The prevalence of anti-linear-2-M3RP antibodies in pSS, SLE and RA patients and healthy controls were 56.1, 20.0, 14.7 and 9.4%."
9931,1074,"(iii) The specificity of anti-c2M3RP antibodies was 95.1%, much higher than that of linear polypeptide (84.7%) for pSS diagnosis."
9932,1074,"(iv) In pSS patients, anti-c2M3RP positivity had significantly increased frequency in patients who were RF or ANA positive, and had several haematological abnormalities, such as leucopenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia."
9933,1074,"Furthermore, the ESSDAI score was significantly higher in anti-c2M3RP-positive pSS patients (P< 0.05)."
9934,1074,CONCLUSION: Anti-c2M3RP antibody was highly specific for patients with pSS.
9935,1074,The presence of anti-c2M3RP antibody in pSS indicates that c2M3RP may act as an autoantigen that may play a role in the pathogenesis of pSS.
9936,1075,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of salivary and lacrimal glands.
9937,1075,The diagnosis of SS can be challenging due to lack of a specific test for the disease.
9938,1075,The purpose of this study is to examine the accuracy of using gene expression profile for diagnosis of SS.
9939,1075,We identified 9 publically available datasets that included gene expression data from saliva and salivary gland biopsy samples of 52 patients with SS and 51 controls.
9940,1075,"Out of these datasets, we compiled and pooled data from three datasets that included 37 and 29 samples from SS patients and healthy controls, respectively, which were designated as ""training set."""
9941,1075,"Then, we performed cross-listing in a group of independent gene expression datasets from patients with SS to identify consensus gene list of differentially expressed genes."
9942,1075,"We performed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to quantify the accuracy of discriminating genes to predict SS in both the ""training set"" and an independent group of datasets that was designated as ""test set."""
9943,1075,We identified 55 genes as potential classifier genes to differentiate SS from healthy controls.
9944,1075,"An LDA by leave-one-out cross-validation method identified 19 genes (EPSTI1, IFI44, IFI44L, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, MX1, OAS1, SAMD9L, PSMB9, STAT1, HERC5, EV12B, CD53, SELL, HLA-DQA1, PTPRC, B2M, and TAP2) with highest classification accuracy rate (95.7 %)."
9945,1075,"Moreover, we validated our results by reproducing the same gene expression profile as a discriminatory test in the ""test set,"" which included data from salivary gland samples of 15 patients with SS and 22 controls with 94.6 % accuracy."
9946,1075,We propose that gene expression profile in the saliva or salivary glands could represent a promising simple and reproducible diagnostic biomarker for SS.
9947,1076,PURPOSE: To define a combination of the Schirmer I and phenol red thread (PRT) tests that improves the screening of patients with ocular sicca syndrome.
9948,1076,"METHODS: The PRT test was performed before (PRT1) and after (PRT2) the Schirmer I test, in both eyes of 143 patients complaining of ocular dryness secondary to Sjgren's syndrome or sicca asthenia polyalgia syndrome (SAPS; 72 and 71 patients, respectively), and in 40 control patients."
9949,1076,Groups were matched by age and sex.
9950,1076,"After determining the best cutoff values using the receiver operating characteristic procedure, several combinations of PRT and Schirmer I were assessed to improve the predictive values of the procedure."
9951,1076,"RESULTS: The best cutoff value for PRT2, estimated at 15 mm, provided a satisfying match between sensitivity and specificity indexes (68% and 90%, respectively), similar to those obtained with the Schirmer I test."
9952,1076,"If PRT1 alone was ineffective to screen SGS from control patients, the comparison between PRT1 and PRT2 (so-called ""DeltaPRT"") was found as a good marker to detect patients with persistent tear reflex."
9953,1076,"Interestingly, the combination of positive Schirmer I, PRT 2, and/or PRT tests was found to be highly predictive of severe ocular sicca syndrome."
9954,1076,CONCLUSIONS: The combination of the Schirmer I and PRT tests strongly improves the screening procedure to detect patients with ocular dryness related to Sjgren's syndrome or SAPS.
9955,1076,"It could be more widely used in daily clinical practice, aside from the Schirmer I test, to optimize the work-up of patients presenting with dry-eye subjective signs."
9956,1077,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare complication, but a significant prognostic factor in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SjS)."
9957,1077,"Despite its efficacy, the long-term use of intravenous epoprostenol is sometimes complicated by adverse effects, such as catheter-related infection."
9958,1077,This case involves a 38-year-old woman with PAH associated with SjS (PAH-SjS) who was transitioned from treatment with long-term intravenous epoprostenol therapy to combination oral therapy containing bosentan and tadalafil.
9959,1077,She has remained in stable condition for more than two years following epoprostenol discontinuation.
9960,1077,The details of this report suggest that long-term epoprostenol therapy can be safely tapered off and replaced with combination oral therapy in carefully selected patients with PAH-SjS.
9961,1078,"This study was conducted to generate and validate a cross-culturally adapted Korean version of the xerostomia inventory (XI), an 11-item questionnaire designed to measure the severity of xerostomia."
9962,1078,The original English version of the XI was translated into Korean according to the guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation of health-related quality-of-life measures.
9963,1078,"Among a prospective cohort of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) in Korea, 194 patients were analyzed."
9964,1078,"Internal consistency was evaluated by using Cronbach's alpha, and test-retest reliability was obtained by using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis."
9965,1078,Construct validity was investigated by performing a correlation analysis between XI total score and salivary flow rate (SFR).
9966,1078,"Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency was 0.868, and the ICC for test-retest reliability ranged from 0.48 to 0.827, with a median value of 0.72."
9967,1078,"Moderate negative correlations between XI score and stimulated SFR, unstimulated SFR, and differential (stimulated minus unstimulated) SFR were observed (Spearman's rho,  = -0.515, -0.447, and -0.482, respectively; P < 0.001)."
9968,1078,"The correlation analysis between the visual analogue scale (VAS) score of overall dryness and SFR indicated a smaller  value (-0.235 [P = 0.006], -0.243 [P = 0.002], and -0.252 [P = 0.003], respectively), which supports that XI more accurately reflects the degree of xerostomia in the pSS patients."
9969,1078,"In conclusion, the Korean version of the XI is a reliable tool to estimate the severity of xerostomia in patients with pSS."
9970,1079,"OBJECTIVES: Impaired sleep and psychological disorders are increasingly recognised as prevalent comorbidities in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), as well as important contributors of atherosclerosis in the general population."
9971,1079,In the current study we sought to explore a potential role of psychological comorbidities in the pronounced atherosclerotic risk of pSS patients.
9972,1079,"METHODS: Fifty-nine pSS patients fulfilling the ACR/EULAR criteria completed specific validated questionnaires assessing fatigue, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances."
9973,1079,"Clinical, laboratory and histopathological characteristics together with traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis were documented in all enrolled patients."
9974,1079,Subclinical atherosclerosis defined either as carotid and/or femoral plaque formation or increased intima media thickness (IMT) levels were assessed by Doppler ultrasound.
9975,1079,Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed.
9976,1079,RESULTS: Plaque formation and high IMT levels were detected by ultrasound in 41(69.5%) out of the 59 pSS patients.
9977,1079,"In univariate analysis, age and higher triglyceride serum levels were associated with both plaque formation and high IMT levels."
9978,1079,Hypertension was associated only with high IMT levels.
9979,1079,"While increased rates of both state anxiety and impaired sleep were detected in pSS patients with plaque formation in a univariate model, only impaired sleep proved to be independently associated with plaque formation among pSS patients (OR = 4.2, 95% CI =1.1-15.6, p=0.03)."
9980,1079,CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study showing impaired sleep to confer a significantly higher risk of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with pSS.
9981,1079,Clinicians should take psychological disturbances into account when trying to assess and manage the cardiovascular disease risk of pSS patients.
9982,1080,Id3-/- mice represent a model for T cell mediated primary Sjogren's syndrome (PSS).
9983,1080,An intriguing feature of this disease model is the early appearance of impaired salivary function or exocrinopathy prior to lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary glands.
9984,1080,This phenomenon prompted us to examine the role of cytokines produced by T cells in the systemic regulation of gland function.
9985,1080,A comprehensive examination of serum cytokine profiles revealed elevated levels of IL-13 in Id3-/- mice.
9986,1080,We found that the increase in serum IL-13 levels in Id3-/- mice was largely dependent on  T cells.
9987,1080,"Removal of  T cells in Id3-/- mice also eliminates disease symptoms, including lymphocytic infiltration in the gland tissues, and impaired saliva production."
9988,1080,"We further show that the number of mast cells in the salivary glands of Id3-/- mice is significantly increased, in a trend inversely related to the saliva production."
9989,1080,This increase in the number of mast cells is also dependent on the presence of  T cells.
9990,1080,"Treatment of young Id3-/- mice with anti-IL-13 antibodies over a two-month period resulted in a reduction of both serum IL-13 levels and the number of mast cells in the salivary gland tissues, as well as correspondingly improved saliva production."
9991,1080,These findings indicate a potentially important role for IL-13 in gland regulation and disease pathology.
9992,1081,A known case of primary Sjogren's syndrome with chronic kidney disease presented with respiratory symptoms and subsequent altered sensorium.
9993,1081,Chest imaging suggested cavitating lung lesions in both the lungs.
9994,1081,Serum c-ANCA was positive without any upper respiratory tract involvement or active urinary sediments.
9995,1081,Treatment with appropriate anti-microbials produced no improvement in the respiratory or neurological parameters.
9996,1081,MRI brain revealed tell-tale signs of CNS vascultis.
9997,1081,A diagnosis of GPA was made as per European Medical Agency algorithm and the patient was started on immune-suppressants to which there was dramatic response.
9998,1081,Her respiratory and neurological parameters started recovering steadily.
9999,1081,However her stay at hospital was complicated by severe hospital acquired pneumonia to which she succumbed.
10000,1081,"We review the intricacies of the case, discussing the diagnostic conundrum and treatment dilemma we faced, as well as the systematic approach employed to manage the patient."
10001,1082,This study was set to investigate whether serum markers of lymphocytic activity are associated with patient-reported outcomes in Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
10002,1082,Forty-six patients with SS were included in this cross-sectional study.
10003,1082,"Patients with monoclonal gammopathy, history of malignant lymphoma, or with secondary SS were excluded."
10004,1082,"Serum levels of IgG, 2-microglobulin (2M), soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL2-R), and free light chains (FLC) were assessed."
10005,1082,Systemic disease activity was measured by the EULAR SS disease activity index (ESSDAI).
10006,1082,"Patient-reported symptoms were recorded by visual analogue scales (VAS) of pain, fatigue, and dryness, as compiled in the EULAR SS patient-reported index (ESSPRI)."
10007,1082,Depressive symptoms were determined by the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9).
10008,1082,"Serum concentrations of FLC (r=0.491, p=0.001), FLC (r=0.326, p=0.027), and 2M (r=0.421, p=0.004) correlated with the ESSDAI, whereas sIL-2R and IgG did not."
10009,1082,"No correlations between serum markers of lymphocytic activity and the ESSPRI, or single VAS measures of pain, dryness, or fatigue, were found."
10010,1082,"In patients with VAS fatigue scores in the upper quartile, sIL-2R serum levels were even decreased (p=0.019)."
10011,1082,"Only depressive symptoms as determined by PHQ-9 were positively correlated with fatigue (r=0.536, p<0.001)."
10012,1082,"In this well-defined cohort of patients with SS, serological lymphocytic activity was not correlated with patient-reported outcomes and sIL-2R levels were even decreased in patients with high fatigue scores."
10013,1082,Only depressive symptoms were correlated with fatigue.
10014,1082,This highlights the need to further understand the link between inflammation and disease characteristics in SS.
10015,1083,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal findings in Sjgren's syndrome are arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, myositis, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue."
10016,1083,Enthesis zones are important in the formation of pain in the musculoskeletal system.
10017,1083,Musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) may show subclinical enthesitis in the synovial joints and in the axial skeleton before joint swelling in inflammatory diseases characterized by arthritis.
10018,1083,"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to determine the presence of enthesopathy using the Madrid sonographic enthesitis index (MASEI) in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS)."
10019,1083,PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with PSS and age-matched healthy controls were included in this study.
10020,1083,All the patients met the 2002 American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism classification criteria for PSS.
10021,1083,The demographic characteristics of the patients were recorded.
10022,1083,"Six enthesis sites were evaluated using gray-scale and Doppler US with a linear transducer, and they were scored using the MASEI."
10023,1083,They were assessed by the EULAR Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI).
10024,1083,RESULTS: We evaluated 40 patients with PSS (average age 48.6711.23years) and 30 healthy controls (average age 45.408.24years).
10025,1083,Patients with PSS had significantly higher MASEI scores than the healthy controls.
10026,1083,"Plantar fascia, Achilles tendon, and distal patellar tendons were significantly thicker in the PSS group than in the healthy controls."
10027,1083,The MASEI total score had a positive correlation with age.
10028,1083,There was no correlation between MASEI total score and BMI and ESSDAI.
10029,1083,"CONCLUSION: In this study, it was shown that the MASEI scores assessed by US were significantly higher in patients with PSS than in healthy controls."
10030,1083,"Plantar fascia, Achilles tendon, and distal patellar tendon were significantly thicker in the PSS group than in the healthy controls."
10031,1083,This result suggests that PSS may be one of the causes of musculoskeletal pain that can be seen in patients with PSS.
10032,1083,Our study was the first study to use an enthesis index ultrasonographically in patients with PSS.
10033,1083,"In addition, it is the first study to investigate the relationship between the presence of enthesopathy and disease activity by means of US."
10034,1084,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of salivary and lacrimal glands resulting in diminished production of saliva and tears.
10035,1084,The pathophysiology of SS has not yet been fully deciphered.
10036,1084,Classically it has been postulated that sicca symptoms in SS patients are a double step process whereby lymphocytic infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands (SG) is followed by epithelial cell destruction resulting in keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia.
10037,1084,"Recent advances in the field of the pathophysiology of SS have brought in new players, such as aquaporins (AQPs) and anti AQPs autoantibodies that could explain underlying mechanistic processes and unveil new pathophysiological pathways offering a deeper understanding of the disease."
10038,1084,"In this review, we delineate the link between the AQP and SS, focusing on salivary glands, and discuss the role of AQPs in the treatment of SS-induced xerostomia."
10039,1085,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate volumetric BMD (vBMD), microarchitecture and strength and vertebral fractures (VFs) in primary SS (pSS)."
10040,1085,"METHODS: We evaluated 71 female pSS patients and 71 gender-, age-, and race-matched controls."
10041,1085,Clinical data including risk factors for osteoporosis (OP) and fractures were collected through a standardized protocol.
10042,1085,Areal BMD and VFs were analysed by DXA.
10043,1085,"Bone microarchitecture, vBMD and bone strength were assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT), a non-invasive method."
10044,1085,"RESULTS: pSS patients and controls were comparable for age, BMI, calcium intake, smoking, menopause, sedentary lifestyle and family history of fractures (P > 0.05)."
10045,1085,OP or low BMD for the patient's age (33.8 vs 5.6%; P < 0.0001) and VFs (19.7 vs 5.6%; P = 0.043) were more frequent in patients than controls.
10046,1085,"HR-pQCT showed deterioration of cortical and trabecular components and strength at the radius, and of cortical components and strength at the tibia (P < 0.05) in patients compared with controls."
10047,1085,"pSS patients and controls were also analysed by multivariate analysis adjusted for age, ethnicity, prednisone use, weight and height, which showed that the pSS group had lower values of cortical vBMD, cortical thickness and apparent modulus (P < 0.05) at the radius and cortical vBMD and apparent modulus (P < 0.05) at the tibia."
10048,1085,Patients with VFs had more cortical bone deterioration (cortical vBMD/cortical thickness) at the tibia compared with patients without VFs (P < 0.05).
10049,1085,CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first to assess bone microarchitecture in pSS and demonstrated that cortical deterioration is the most important abnormality observed in pSS patients with VFs.
10050,1085,"This novel finding shows that this compartment contributes to vertebral fragility, suggesting that this non-invasive evaluation may be useful in the clinical practice."
10051,1086,OBJECTIVE: To investigate cognitive deficits in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS).
10052,1086,"METHOD: Eighteen patients with PSS, aged between 25 and 61 years, were subjected to a short neuropsychological battery and compared with 18 patients with multiple sclerosis and 18 healthy controls."
10053,1086,"RESULTS: The analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that the clinical groups had significantly worse performance than the control group on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 3; (F(2,53) =3.500, p=0.038) and 7 (F(2,53) =5.068, p=0.010)."
10054,1086,The clinical groups had elevated levels of depression on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); (p=0.003).
10055,1086,The analysis of the data from the Trail Making Test B-A revealed a significant difference between the clinical and control groups (p=0.023).
10056,1086,"The analysis of covariance with BDI score as a covariate, did not change the outcome."
10057,1086,CONCLUSION: Our study revealed cognitive deficits in patients with PSS detectable by a short neuropsychological battery.
10058,1087,We visualized the intraparotid facial nerve and parotid duct at 3 tesla using 3-dimensional reversed fast imaging with steady-state precession (FSIP) (3D-PSIF) with diffusion weighting.
10059,1087,"Excellent fat suppression by water-selective excitation, sufficient T(2)-weighting of 3D-PSIF, vessel suppression by diffusion weighting, and high spatial resolution allowed the simultaneous visualization."
10060,1087,We also present volumetric representation of the facial nerve and duct.
10061,1088,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the sleep quality in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients and evaluate its relationship with the disease, quality of life and mood disorders."
10062,1088,METHODS: The sleep quality of 29 pSS women and 29 matched controls was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
10063,1088,"Seven domains are grouped according to three factors: F1 perceived sleep quality (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, use of sleeping medication), F2 sleep efficiency (sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency) and F3 daily disturbances (sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction)."
10064,1088,These domains are scored as a single factor of global sleep quality.
10065,1088,"The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) fatigue scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were also administered."
10066,1088,"Disease activity and damage were evaluated with the EULAR Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI), the Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity and Damage Indexes (SSDAI, SSDDI)."
10067,1088,RESULTS: The mean PSQI global score had higher pathological values (8.64.6) compared with controls (5.62.2) (p=0.002).
10068,1088,"F1 and F3 were significantly worse in cases (p=0.01, p=0.009)."
10069,1088,"A negative correlation was found between SF-36 subscales and the global PSQI, F2 and F3."
10070,1088,"The anxiety HADS correlated with F2 and F3, while depression only with F3."
10071,1088,No correlation with FACIT and disease indexes emerged.
10072,1088,"CONCLUSIONS: Using PSQI, an impaired sleep quality was demonstrated in pSS patients, especially with perceived quality and the daily disturbances."
10073,1088,It is associated with a reduced quality of life but not with disease-related variables.
10074,1089,"OBJECTIVE: In daily practice, we noticed that hand osteoarthritis (OA) was commonly associated with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS)."
10075,1089,"Therefore, we aimed to investigate its prevalence in patients with pSS in a controlled study."
10076,1089,METHODS: The study included patients with pSS and controls with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
10077,1089,Standard hand/wrist radiographs were obtained and classified according to the Kellgren-Lawrence system.
10078,1089,"""Erosive hand OA"" was defined according to the Verbruggen-Veys classification."
10079,1089,"RESULTS: There were 114 patients with pSS (110 women, 51.0 yrs) and 34 patients with SLE (33 women, 42.4 yrs)."
10080,1089,"Among 114 patients with pSS, 42.7% had radiographic, 30.3% symptomatic, and 16.0% erosive hand OA."
10081,1089,"The prevalences of radiographic (45.5%) and erosive hand OA (14.4%) in 90 patients with pSS with age- and sex-matched patients with SLE were significantly higher than those in patients with SLE (14.7% and 0.0%, p = 0.007 and p = 0.012, respectively)."
10082,1089,"Interobserver reliabilities for diagnosing radiographic and erosive OA were found to be good ( = 0.780 and  = 0.788, respectively)."
10083,1089,"Intraobserver reliabilities for diagnosing radiographic and erosive OA were also good ( = 0.784 and  = 0.825 for FO, and  = 0.722 and  = 0.800 for AB, respectively)."
10084,1089,The frequency of hand OA in patients with pSS was found to be increased with increasing age (r = 0.513).
10085,1089,The mean age of those with erosive hand OA was significantly higher than those without erosive OA (p < 0.001).
10086,1089,"CONCLUSION: This study suggests that pSS, conversely to SLE, is more frequently associated with hand OA."
10087,1090,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of neurological complications related to lip biopsy for SS diagnosis using conventional vs minimally invasive techniques.
10088,1090,"METHODS: We performed a systematic review and prevalence meta-analysis using the search strategy [(salivary gland biopsy OR labial biopsy OR lip biopsy) AND (Sjgren)] in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index databases."
10089,1090,"Studies were selected if they included original data for minor salivary gland biopsy, sample size, exposure of interest (technique description), number of complications and number of affected patients."
10090,1090,The prevalence of total and permanent neurological adverse effects was calculated.
10091,1090,Both fixed-effects and random-effects pooled estimates were assessed.
10092,1090,Heterogeneity was calculated using an adaptation of the DerSimonian and Laird Q test.
10093,1090,RESULTS: Sixteen articles were selected for the study.
10094,1090,"In the minimally invasive group (n = 3), the pooled prevalence of total adverse events is almost four times higher than that in the linear incision group (n = 12) (4.73% vs. 1.20%)."
10095,1090,"In contrast, the pooled prevalence of the permanent or potentially permanent neurological adverse events is 8.5 times lower in the minimally invasive technique group than in the studies using linear incisions (0.17% vs. 1.45%)."
10096,1090,"CONCLUSION: With the limitations intrinsic to the potential biases in the studies included in this meta-analysis, we conclude that the minimally invasive lip biopsy technique for SS diagnosis induces fewer permanent neurological complications than conventional approaches with large linear incisions in the lower lip."
10097,1091,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of cardiovascular involvement and analyze potential risk factors independently associated with cardiovascular involvement in primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS) patients.
10098,1091,METHODS: We recruited a cohort of 367 PSS patients and 367 age- and gender-matched controls from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University.
10099,1091,"Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, and overt cardiovascular involvement events were recorded."
10100,1091,Potential risk factors associated with cardiovascular involvement were determined by multivariate analyses.
10101,1091,RESULTS: PSS patients had a significantly higher cardiovascular involvement rate than that of the controls (61.6% versus 29.7%; p<0.01).
10102,1091,"Compared with PSS patients without cardiovascular involvement, those with cardiovascular involvement were significantly older; had higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipemia; were more likely to have extraglandular organ involvement; and had a higher level of C-reactive protein (CRP) (all p<0.05)."
10103,1091,"In the multivariate analysis, age, hypertension, and extraglandular organ involvement were found to be risk factors independently correlated with cardiovascular events in PSS patients."
10104,1091,CONCLUSIONS: PSS patients are more vulnerable to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).
10105,1091,"In addition to traditional CVD risk factors such as age and hypertension, extraglandular organ involvement was found to be independently associated with cardiovascular involvement in PSS patients, which suggests the need for early detection and prevention measures to improve the prognosis in those patients."
10106,1092,PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of lid debridement-scaling (LDS) on dry eye signs and symptoms in subjects with Sjgren syndrome (SS).
10107,1092,METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled study enrolled 14 female subjects with SS.
10108,1092,Seven subjects were randomized into the treatment group where they were selected to receive LDS; the remainder did not receive LDS and served as control subjects.
10109,1092,"Lid debridement-scaling was conducted using a stainless steel golf club spud (Hilco Wilson Ophthalmics, Plainville, MA) on both the upper and lower eyelids of both eyes."
10110,1092,Outcome variables were assessed before LDS and again 1 month later.
10111,1092,"The outcome variables were the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), Symptom Assessment iN Dry Eye (SANDE) visual analog scores, ocular staining (SICCA OSS [Sjgren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance Ocular Staining Score]), fluorescein tear breakup time (FLBUT), meibomian gland score (MGS), meibomian gland yielding liquid secretions (MGYLS) score, and line of Marx's (LOM) position."
10112,1092,RESULTS: Thirteen subjects completed the study.
10113,1092,Data from only the right eye were analyzed.
10114,1092,"For the control group (n = 6; mean [ SD] age, 62.3 [ 11.6] years), the pre-LDS, post-LDS, and significance level (pre-LDS mean [ SD] vs. post-LDS mean [ SD]; p value) were as follows: OSDI (58.3 [ 22.1] vs. 48.3 [ 29.0]; p = 0.051), SANDE (77.4 [ 22.1] vs. 89.6 [ 32.6]; p = 0.20), SICCA OSS (7.0 [ 4.5] vs. 8.2 [ 3.5]; p = 0.25), MGS (1.3 [ 1.5] vs. 1.0 [ 0.9]; p = 0.75), MGYLS (0.3 [ 0.5] vs. 0.0 [ 0.0]; p = 0.50), FLBUT (2.99 [ 1.54] vs. 2.85 [ 1.79]; p = 0.63), and LOM (2.0 [ 0.0] vs. 2.0 [ 0.0]; p = n/a)."
10115,1092,"For the treatment group (n = 7; mean [ SD] age, 58.0 [ 8.1] years), the pre-LDS, post-LDS, and significance level were as follows: OSDI (63.2 [ 13.3] vs. 46.9 [ 19.4]; p = 0.04), SANDE (72.6 [ 17.1] vs. 77.0 [ 28.0]; p = 0.54), SICCA OSS (6.6 [ 2.9] vs. 5.0 [ 3.9]; p = 0.02), MGS (1.0 [ 1.2] vs. 3.1 [ 1.7]; p = 0.01), MGYLS (0.0 [ 0.0] vs. 0.6 [ 1.0]; p = 0.50), FLBUT (3.13 [ 0.81] vs. 3.45 [ 1.03]; p = 0.53), and LOM (0.9 [ 0.9] vs. 1.0 [ 1.0]; p = 1.00)."
10116,1092,"CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study showed that LDS improved symptoms, ocular staining, and meibomian gland function for the group that received LDS."
10117,1092,This indicates that LDS can aid in the management of SS dry eye.
10118,1093,Sjgren's syndrome is the second most common rheumatic disease in which autoimmune response targets exocrine glands (salivary and lacrimal glands) result in clinical symptoms of dry mouth and dry eye.
10119,1093,"Inflammation of the lacrimal gland induces tear abnormalities that contribute to the inflammation of the ocular surface, which includes ocular mucosa."
10120,1093,Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) plays a critical regulatory role in the ocular mucosa and as such TSP-1(-/-) mice develop spontaneously chronic ocular surface inflammation associated with Sjgren's syndrome.
10121,1093,The autoimmune pathology is also accompanied by a peripheral imbalance in regulatory (T(reg) ) and inflammatory Th17 effectors.
10122,1093,"In this study, we demonstrate an in-vitro effect of a CD47-binding TSP-derived peptide in the induction of transforming growth factor (TGF)-1-secreting forkhead box protein 2 (Foxp3(+) ) T(regs) from activated CD4(+) CD25(-) T cells and the inhibition of pathogenic T helper type 17 (Th17)-promoting interleukin (IL)-23 derived from antigen-presenting cells."
10123,1093,The in-vivo administration of this peptide promotes Foxp3(+) T(reg) induction and inhibition of Th17 development.
10124,1093,"Consistent with these results, topical administration of CD47-binding TSP peptide, both before and after the onset of the disease, attenuates clinical symptoms of SS-associated dry eye in TSP-1(-/-) mice."
10125,1093,Augmented expression of Foxp3 detected in the draining lymph nodes of TSP peptide -treated mice compared to those treated with control peptide suggests the ability of TSP peptide to restore peripheral immune imbalance.
10126,1093,"Thus, our results suggest that TSP-derived peptide attenuates Sjgren's syndrome-associated dry eye and autoimmune inflammation by preventing Th17 development while promoting the induction of T(regs) ."
10127,1093,"Collectively, our data identify TSP-derived peptide as a novel therapeutic option to treat autoimmune diseases."
10128,1094,Objective: To describe baseline characteristics of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) with right heart catheterization (RHC)-confirmed pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
10129,1094,Methods: This retrospective study included consecutive patients hospitalized with pSS-PAH from Jan.2013 to June.2019 in Tianjin Medical University General Hospital.
10130,1094,All patients fulfilled the 2002 revised criteria for pSS proposed by the American-European Consensus Group.
10131,1094,PAH was defined according to RHC-based European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines.
10132,1094,Associated variables were described and analyzed.
10133,1094,Predictive factors for achieving treatment goals were explored.
10134,1094,Sub-groups(based on Anti-SSB antibody positive/negative) were analyzed.
10135,1094,"Results: Twenty patients with RHC-confirmed pSS-PAH were included (median age at onset, 54.5 years; median PAH duration, 12 months).PAH was the initial manifestation of pSS in 5 patients(26.3%), and shortness of breath was the most common symptom (17/20,85%)."
10136,1094,"Mean pulmonary arterialpressure (mPAP) was 48(38, 55.75)mmHg, pulmonary vascularresistance (PVR) was 11.23 (6.17,14.69)IU, and mean cardiac index was 2.59(2.04,2.98)Lmin(-1)m(-2) in this group."
10137,1094,"In addition, right ventricular diameter40 mm[P=0.009, HR=5.92, 95%CI(1.55, 22.59)] was predictive factor for achieving the treatment goal."
10138,1094,"Furthermore, compared with Anti-SSB antibody negative patients, patients with Anti-SSB antibody positive had a higher PVR(IU) [14.1(11.23, 22.63)vs 6.4(6.15, 12.36),P=0.025], a higher mPAP(mmHg)[5(48.5,59)vs 39(32.5,50.75),P=0.013], and a lower cardiac index (Lmin(-1)m(-2)) [2.1(1.6,2.5)vs 2.9(2.56,3.41),P=0.002]."
10139,1094,Conclusions: pSS-PAH patients are mainly middle-aged women with the most common symptom shortness of breath.
10140,1094,And PAH can be the first manifestation of pSS.
10141,1094,"More attention should be paid to patients with Anti-La/SSB antibody positive and right ventricular diameter 40 mm because of higher mPAP, PVR, worse cardiac function and prognosis."
10142,1095,BACKGROUND: SjOgren's Syndrome (SS) is a systemic and chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the exocrine glands with massive autoantibody production.
10143,1095,"Although the pathogenesis of the disorder is incompletely understood, but some studies have reported that anti-moesin antibodies have been detected in autoimmune diseases with which SS is closely associated."
10144,1095,"Here, we have investigated moesin's potential involvement in SS."
10145,1095,OBJECTIVE: This study aims to verify whether moesin is a specific autoantigen involved in Chinese Hans SS patients.
10146,1095,"METHODS: First, recombinant human moesin was expressed and purified."
10147,1095,"Next, the protein was verified as antigen by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation."
10148,1095,The positive protein band in the immunoprecipitation was identified by (MALDI-TOF/TOF).
10149,1095,"Finally, an optimized ELISA (Enzyme- Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kit was developed to measure the titer concentration of anti-moesin antibody-positive patients in a large cohort of clinical subjects."
10150,1095,"RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that the proportion of individuals positive for serum IgG against recombinant human moesin was 42 % in a group of Chinese Hans SS patients (21 of 50), 22 % in systemic lupus erythematosus patients and (11 of 50), compared to only 4 % in healthy controls (2 of 50)."
10151,1095,CONCLUSION: An association between anti-moesin antibodies and SS manifestation have been found which may be considered a suspected serum biomarker for the development of SS.
10152,1096,"OBJECTIVE: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a complex disorder, in part due to B cell abnormalities."
10153,1096,"Although anti-B cell therapy is promising in primary SS, no treatment has yet been demonstrated to modify the disease course."
10154,1096,This open-label study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of rituximab in primary SS and to investigate whether expression of specific genes is associated with efficacy of this treatment.
10155,1096,METHODS: Fifteen patients with primary SS were treated in an open-label trial.
10156,1096,"Salivary gland biopsy specimens were obtained, and total RNA was extracted and amplified."
10157,1096,"Microarray analysis with the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array was used to analyze >54,000 transcripts, and potential pathways were identified."
10158,1096,"RESULTS: With gene expression data obtained before treatment, patients could be correctly classified in terms of whether they would be responders or nonresponders to rituximab."
10159,1096,Gene pathway analysis demonstrated that the B cell signaling pathway was the most profoundly differentially expressed before treatment in the responders compared with nonresponders.
10160,1096,Subclassification of patients based on the level of infiltration also demonstrated differential expression of genes belonging to the interferon (IFN) pathway between responders and nonresponders.
10161,1096,"Furthermore, unsupervised analysis based on gene expression modification before and after treatment allowed identification of 8 genes that were differentially expressed between responders and nonresponders, with the difference remaining significant after Bonferroni correction."
10162,1096,CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the ability to elaborate a set of genes predictive of rituximab efficacy and highlight the importance of studying the differential expression of B cell and IFN pathway signaling molecules in relation to the response to anti-CD20 treatment.
10163,1096,A randomized controlled study is currently ongoing to confirm these results.
10164,1097,"Having the characteristic features of elevated serum IgG4 levels and prominent infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells with fibrosis in lesions, Mikulicz's disease (MD) has been recognized as an IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD)."
10165,1097,"Although incidence of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), one of the organ characteristics of IgG4-RD, has been internationally reported, there are only a few such reports of IgG4-related MD."
10166,1097,The limited number of reports might be attributable to the low recognition of IgG4-related MD as a clinical entity as well as its misdiagnosis as Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
10167,1097,"Thus, we compared several clinical features of MD with SS to improve proper clinical diagnosis of MD in the clinical setting."
10168,1097,A total of 70 SS and 70 MD cases evaluated at Sapporo Medical University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed.
10169,1097,"In SS patients, sicca symptoms were the most frequent (87%), followed by articular symptoms (23%), while lacrimal and salivary gland swelling were a rare (10%) and transient manifestation."
10170,1097,"In contrast, lacrimal or salivary gland swelling was observed in all patients with MD."
10171,1097,"Although nearly 60% of MD patients complained of sicca syndrome, skin rash and arthralgia were rare symptoms."
10172,1097,"Hypergammaglobulinemia was recognized in both SS and MD patients, but the occurrence of autoantibodies in patients with IgG4-related MD was low."
10173,1097,"Extraglandular organ involvement, often involving the retroperitoneum, pancreas, kidney and lung, was often discovered at the time of IgG4-related MD diagnosis."
10174,1097,"Although corticosteroid therapy tended to delay the hypofunction of salivary gland in SS patients, recovery of decreased function of salivary glands were observed in IgG4-related MD patients."
10175,1097,These results suggest the beneficial effect of aggressive corticosteroid intervention in patients with IgG4-related MD.
10176,1097,"Although SS and MD are both chronic inflammatory diseases affecting the lacrimal and salivary glands, their clinical features and corticosteroid responsiveness are different."
10177,1097,"Thus, differential diagnosis of these conditions is warranted."
10178,1098,AIM: Cognitive dysfunction is a neurologic manifestation in primary Sjgren syndrome (PSS).
10179,1098,"On the other hand, several antibodies are related to cognitive dysfunction."
10180,1098,The aim of this study is to assess the cognitive dysfunction of PSS patients via detailed neurologic tests.
10181,1098,"Moreover, its associations with antibodies were also evaluated."
10182,1098,METHOD: Twenty-eight female patients with PSS and 17 healthy controls comprised the study groups.
10183,1098,"Short-term memory, long-term memory, verbal learning, visual memory, visual spatial perception, attention, verbal frequency function, executive functions and information processing speed were evaluated with neurologic tests in both of the study groups."
10184,1098,"Furthermore, anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type anti-glutamate-receptor antibody, anti-ribosomal-p and antiganglioside antibodies were assessed in the study groups."
10185,1098,"RESULTS: The attention, data processing speed, verbal learning, short-term verbal memory and visuo-spatial perception performances were lower in the patients with PSS when compared to the healthy controls."
10186,1098,"The difference reached statistical significance in Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (P < 0.01), Serial Digit Learning Test (P < 0.01), clock drawing (P = 0.03), Auditory Verbal Learning Test immediate verbal memory (P = 0.01) and Benton Judgement of Line Orientation Test (P = 0.03)."
10187,1098,"Even if antiganglioside antibodies were more likely to be present in the PSS group when compared to the healthy controls, no relationship was found between its positivity and cognitive dysfunction."
10188,1098,CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest that cognitive dysfunction is quite prevalent in PSS patients without being associated with studied antibodies.
10189,1099,BACKGROUND/AIM: Low levels of vitamin D play a role progression of cardiovascular diseases.
10190,1099,Knowledge lacks whether a relationship exists between vitamin D levels and subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
10191,1099,PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated vitamin D levels and subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in 25 patients with pSS compared to 22 mild ostheoarthritic control patients (OCp).
10192,1099,"RESULTS: Intima-media thickness (IMT) and levels of vitamin D were significantly increased and decreased in pSS, respectively."
10193,1099,No correlation was observed between low levels of vitamin D and IMT in pSS.
10194,1099,Significant positive correlation between disease duration and IMT and negative between vitamin D levels and increased Sjgren syndrome disease activity index (SSDAI) and syndrome disease damage index (SSDDI) were also found in pSS.
10195,1099,CONCLUSION: IMT of pSS with long disease duration is significantly increased with respect to that of OCp.
10196,1099,"Vitamin D deficiency does not play a role on IMT of pSS, whereas it plays a role in disease damage and activity."
10197,1099,A long disease duration is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in pSS.
10198,1100,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that is characterized by dysfunction and destruction of the exocrine glands.
10199,1100,Exocrinopathy is associated with periductal mononuclear cell infiltrates in the affected exocrine glands and B-cell hyperreactivity.
10200,1100,"Epithelial cells are thought to play an important pathogenetic role, as suggested by the occurrence of infiltrating lesions in various epithelial tissues (described as autoimmune epithelitis) as well as the increased epithelial expression of several inflammatory proteins in the histopathologic lesions of patients."
10201,1100,The application of long-term cultured non-neoplastic salivary gland epithelial cell (SGEC) lines has permitted the more explicit investigation of the role of these cells in the pathophysiology of SS.
10202,1100,"These studies have revealed the inherent capacity of SGEC to induce and promote chronic inflammatory reactions, as corroborated by the constitutive or inducible expression of various molecules implicated in innate and acquired immune responses."
10203,1100,"Furthermore, significantly increased constitutive expression of several molecules has been observed in SGEC lines derived from SS patients, as compared to those obtained from disease control patients."
10204,1100,This fact strongly indicates the operation of intrinsic activation mechanisms in the epithelia of SS patients and further supports the active participation of these cells in the pathogenesis of the disorder.
10205,1101,We describe herein a case of hypokalemia due to proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and Fanconi's syndrome (FS) and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with DIC - a rare complication of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and brucellosis.
10206,1101,"The interesting feature of this case was the presentation with severe hypokalemia, causing acute flaccid quadriparesis with cardiac arrest which is extremely rare."
10207,1101,The patient was a 48-year-old woman who suffered cardiopulmonary arrest an hour after hospitalization.
10208,1101,"Analysis of a blood sample obtained before her cardiopulmonary arrest yielded surprising results: laboratory investigations showed profound hypokalemia (1.1mEq/L) with renal K wasting, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap, hypophosphatemia with hypouricemia, glucosuria, and proteinuria."
10209,1101,A diagnosis of RTA and FS were made.
10210,1101,"On the seventh day, she looked acutely ill, temperature 38.8C and pale, and her physical examination revealed purpuric skin lesions on both legs."
10211,1101,The serum antibrucella titration agglutination test was found to be 1 of 160 positive with a nosocomial infection.
10212,1101,The clinical and laboratory findings were consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
10213,1101,She was unable to concentrate her urine and so a diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) was reached.
10214,1101,"A thorough survey for the cause of FS, RTA and NDI revealed that she had xerophthalmia and xerostomia accompanied by high anti-Ro antibody, positive Schirmer test, confirming the diagnosis of SS."
10215,1102,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sensory neuronopathies (SN) are peripheral nervous system disorders associated with degeneration of dorsal root ganglion neurons.
10216,1102,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown abnormalities limited to T2-weighted high signal intensity in the posterior columns.
10217,1102,METHODS AND RESULTS: A 65-year-old woman with Sjgren syndrome had slowly progressive unsteadiness of gait and limb paresthesias.
10218,1102,"A blink reflex examination suggested a paramedian brainstem lesion, confirmed by MRI."
10219,1102,"CONCLUSIONS: Sjgren's syndrome-related SN may be associated with a more diffuse immune-mediated aggression, involving also the brainstem, and leading to some of the blink reflex abnormalities observed in nonparaneoplastic SN."
10220,1103,"Sjgren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by decreased exocrine gland secretions; patients may also present several hematological abnormalities, like lymphopenia."
10221,1103,"We describe the case of a 28 year old man who complained of headache a month of duration, with fever and vomiting in the last 48 hours."
10222,1103,"He also presented skin lesions on trunk and face, without neck stiffness."
10223,1103,"The diagnosis of duration infection was confirmed by culture from the skin biopsy and spinal fluid specimens; in addition, the presence of lymphopenia, positive anti Ro-SSA antibodies, poor concentration of the tracer in scintigraphy and lymphocytic infiltration in salivary glands confirmed the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome."
10224,1103,the patient was successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin and itraconazole.
10225,1103,"We report this case to emphasize that opportunistic infections, such as disseminated histoplasmosis, may be an uncommon clinical presentation of Sjgren's syndrome."
10226,1104,"Objective: To examine lymphoma subtypes, clinical characteristics, and gender differences in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and lymphoma in a population-based setting.Method: Patients with Sjgren's syndrome and lymphoma diagnoses were identified by linkage of the Swedish Patient Register 1964-2007 with the Cancer Register 1990-2007."
10227,1104,Clinical data were collected from medical records and lymphoma tissues were re-examined.
10228,1104,The lymphoma subtype distribution was compared with the Swedish Lymphoma Register.Results: We identified 105 pSS patients with lymphoma.
10229,1104,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (32%) and marginal zone lymphoma [MZL including mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma] (31%) were the most common lymphoma subtypes.
10230,1104,"The proportion of DLBCL was not increased compared to the general population reference (32%, p =1), in contrast to MZL (general population 5%, p <0.0001)."
10231,1104,"Compared to DLBCL, MALT lymphoma was diagnosed at a younger age (55 vs 67years, p =0.0001), and earlier after patient-reported sicca onset (7 vs 18years, p =0.0001) and pSS diagnosis (2 vs 9years, p =0.0005)."
10232,1104,"Sixteen of the pSS-lymphoma cases were men (15%), twice the proportion in general pSS populations."
10233,1104,"Compared to women, men had a shorter median time from pSS diagnosis to lymphoma diagnosis (1 vs 8years, p =0.0003) and more often had lymphoma in the salivary glands (56% vs 29%, p =0.04).Conclusion: DLBCL and MZL are common in pSS patients, but only MZL/MALT lymphoma occurs at an increased relative frequency in pSS compared to the general population."
10234,1104,The study supports increased awareness of signs of lymphoma in men in the first years after pSS diagnosis.
10235,1105,Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is an uncommon but clinically significant disorder in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
10236,1105,"Among 565 pSS patients hospitalized in Peking University People's Hospital from January 2000 to March 2013, 16 patients were diagnosed with AIHA (2.8% prevalence)."
10237,1105,AIHA presented at the onset of pSS without overt sicca symptoms in 3 of the 16 patients.
10238,1105,Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) was more prevalent in the patients with SS-AIHA than in those without (p=0.007).
10239,1105,"Edema, fever, and liver involvement occurred significantly more frequently in pSS patients with AIHA than those without AIHA (p=0.035, p=0.029, p=0.024, respectively)."
10240,1105,"The pSS patients with AIHA were more vulnerable to leukopenia and thrombocytopenia than those without AIHA (p=0.004 and p=0.001, respectively)."
10241,1105,"Additionally, the levels of complement component 3 (C3) and complement component 4 (C4) were significantly lower in the SS-AIHA group (p=0.008 and p=0.037, respectively)."
10242,1105,"Taken together, our results indicate that pSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of AIHA, even in the absence of sicca symptoms."
10243,1105,"Among pSS patients, the existence of PBC, cytopenia, or hypocomplementemia suggests a higher risk of suffering from AIHA."
10244,1106,"Anti-Ro(52/60) and anti-La constitute the hallmark autoantibodies in primary Sjgren's syndrome, being present in 40-70% of sera."
10245,1106,"Several anti-Ro/La assays exist, but antibody detection appears to be assay-specific, thus the aim of this study was to compare several anti-Ro/La assays."
10246,1106,"In total, 96 sera from individuals with primary Sjgren's syndrome and 114 healthy controls were tested for anti-Ro 52/60 and anti-La in 17 immunoassays."
10247,1106,"Especially the immunoassays used for detection of anti-Ro 52 differed in their sensitivity (48-79%), while only small differences in sensitivities were observed for the anti-Ro 60 (69-77%) anti-La (39-44%) assays."
10248,1106,"Concordances of 65%, 79% and 73% for the anti-Ro 52, anti-Ro 60 and anti-La assays were found, respectively."
10249,1106,"The majority of the assays yielded high specificities, primarily ranging from 97 to 100%, except from a single anti-Ro 60 assay, which yielded a specificity of 79%."
10250,1106,"Occasionally, reactivity levels were increased in a few assays, indicating that false-positive results can be obtained when applying assays of reduced specificity."
10251,1106,"In general, the commercial assays appeared to perform better than the in-house analyses."
10252,1106,"When correcting the in-house assays for background reactivity, sensitivities were reduced by approximately 7%, 17%, and 19% for anti-Ro 52, anti-Ro 60 and anti-La assays, respectively, illustrating the pitfalls when applying immunoassays for detection of autoantibodies, which in theory may apply to commercial assays as well."
10253,1106,"Finally, increased total sensitivities were obtained when combining assays."
10254,1106,"These studies contribute to clarify the clinical utility of immunoassays for detection of autoantibodies of Ro 52, Ro 60 and La and illustrate that the most efficient strategy to maximize antibody sensitivity is to combine several assays."
10255,1107,Immunologic congenital atrioventricular block is due to the presence of anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies in maternal blood.
10256,1107,This pathology is often diagnosed when the status is irreversible and is consequently associated with a high morbi-mortality.
10257,1107,Close monitoring for high risk pregnancies can help to diagnose first and second degrees heart block and treatments can be offered when the block is still reversible.
10258,1107,"Fluorocorticoids, betamimetics and hydroxychloroquine use is not consensual."
10259,1107,Studies are still in progress to prove their utility.
10260,1107,We report the antenatal managing of a patient in which Goujerot-Sjgren disease was diagnosed after the revealing of an atrioventricular block in her fetus.
10261,1107,"After a brief physiopathological description, we present the current knowledge in preventive and curative treatments."
10262,1108,We report a 30-year-old woman who presented with a hypokaliemia-related subacute quadriparesis.
10263,1108,The various causes of hypokalemia induced paresis were discussed but the association of hypokalemia with metabolic acidosis and normal anion gap was diagnostic of distal renal tubular acidosis.
10264,1108,The renal tubulopathy was the presenting manifestation of a primary Sjogren's syndrome.
10265,1108,Distal renal tubular acidosis concerns a third of the patients affected by this auto-immune disease.
10266,1109,"INTRODUCTION: Near 10 to 20% of patients with myositis have another systemic, sometimes inaugural, disease."
10267,1109,"CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old woman was admitted with progressive hypoesthesia in V2 and V3 areas on both sides, difficulties to chew and swallow and then, proximal and axial muscular deficiency, with weight loss."
10268,1109,Brain MRI showed gadolinium-enhanced trigeminal nerves and biological tests revealed anti-SSA and anti-Pm/Scl antibodies and a grade IV in Chisholm scoring system on the labial salivary gland biopsy.
10269,1109,Neurophysiological studies revealed a myogenic pattern on tibialis anterior muscles and a muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of polymyositis.
10270,1109,CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of primitive Sjogren's syndrome was suspected because of the association of bilateral trigeminal neuropathy and anti-SSA and anti-Pm/Scl antibodies.
10271,1110,"BACKGROUND: Mononuclear cell infiltration of exocrine glands, production of Ro/SSA and La/SSB autoantibodies, along with oral and ocular dryness, are characteristic features of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
10272,1110,"Non-SS sicca subjects, an underexplored group in relation to pSS, display similar sicca symptoms, with possible mild signs of inflammation in their salivary glands, yet with no serological detection of autoantibody production."
10273,1110,"In this study, we investigated inflammatory manifestations in the salivary gland tissue, tear fluid and saliva of non-SS subjects, as compared to pSS patients and healthy individuals."
10274,1110,"METHODS: Fifteen non-SS, 10 pSS and 10 healthy subjects were included in the analyses."
10275,1110,Histological evaluation of salivary gland biopsies was performed.
10276,1110,"Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was conducted on tear fluid and stimulated whole saliva, and proteomic biomarker profiles were generated."
10277,1110,Extracellular vesicle (EVs) isolation and characterisation from both fluids were also combined with LC-MS.
10278,1110,The LC-MS data were analysed for quantitative differences between patient and control groups using Scaffold.
10279,1110,"Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Functional Enrichment Analysis Tool (FunRich) were applied for functional analyses."
10280,1110,"RESULTS: Histopathological evaluation of salivary gland biopsies showed implications of milder inflammation in non-SS subjects through mononuclear cell infiltration, fibrosis and fatty replacement, as compared to pSS patients."
10281,1110,"Although unaffected in the non-SS group, upregulation of proinflammatory pathways and proteins involved in ubiquitination (LMO7 and HUWE1) and B cell differentiation (TPD52) were detected in tear fluid of pSS patients."
10282,1110,"Moreover, overexpression of proteins STOM, ANXA4 and ANXA1, regulating cellular innate and adaptive immunological pathways, were further identified in EVs from tear fluid of pSS patients."
10283,1110,"Finally, whole saliva and EVs isolated from whole saliva of pSS patients expressed proteins vital for innate MHC class I cellular regulation (NGAL) and T cell activation (CD44)."
10284,1110,"CONCLUSIONS: Non-SS sicca subjects may show implications of mild inflammation in their glandular tissue, while their protein profile was strikingly more similar to healthy controls than to pSS patients."
10285,1110,"Hence, the tear and salivary biomarkers identified could be implemented as potential non-invasive diagnostic tools that may aid in increasing diagnostic accuracy when evaluating non-SS subjects and pSS patients and monitoring disease progression."
10286,1111,"OBJECTIVES: SS is characterized by chronic inflammation of the salivary glands leading to loss of secretory function, thereby suggesting specialized pro-resolving mediators targeting inflammation to be a viable option for treating SS."
10287,1111,Previous studies demonstrated that aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1) prevents chronic inflammation and enhances saliva secretion in a SS-like mouse model when applied before disease onset.
10288,1111,"However, this therapy cannot be used in SS patients given that diagnosis occurs post-disease onset and no reliable screening methods exist."
10289,1111,"Therefore, we examined whether treatment with AT-RvD1 reduces SS-like features in a mouse model post-disease onset."
10290,1111,"METHODS: Tail vein injections were performed in a SS-like mouse model both with and without AT-RvD1 post-disease onset for 8 weeks, with salivary gland function and inflammatory status subsequently determined."
10291,1111,RESULTS: Treatment of a SS-like mouse model with AT-RvD1 post-disease onset restores saliva secretion in both females and males.
10292,1111,"Moreover, although AT-RvD1 treatment does not reduce the overall submandibular gland lymphocytic infiltration, it does reduce the number of T helper 17 cells within the infiltrates in both sexes."
10293,1111,"Finally, AT-RvD1 reduces SS-associated pro-inflammatory cytokine gene and protein expression levels in submandibular glands from female but not male mice."
10294,1111,"CONCLUSION: AT-RvD1 treatment administered post-disease onset reduces T helper 17 cells and successfully restores salivary gland function in a SS mouse model with variable effects noted by sex, thus warranting further examination of both the causes for the sex differences and the mechanisms responsible for the observed treatment effect."
10295,1112,OBJECTIVES: To analyse the influence of geolocation and ethnicity on the clinical presentation of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) at diagnosis.
10296,1112,"METHODS: The Big Data Sjgren Project Consortium is an international, multicentre registry designed in 2014."
10297,1112,"By January 2016, 20 centres from five continents were participating."
10298,1112,Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed.
10299,1112,"RESULTS: We included 7748 women (93%) and 562 men (7%), with a mean age at diagnosis of primary SjS of 53years."
10300,1112,"Ethnicity data were available for 7884 patients (95%): 6174 patients (78%) were white, 1066 patients (14%) were Asian, 393 patients (5%) were Hispanic, 104 patients (1%) were black/African-American and 147 patients (2%) were of other ethnicities."
10301,1112,SjS was diagnosed a mean of 7years earlier in black/African-American compared with white patients; the female-to-male ratio was highest in Asian patients (27:1) and lowest in black/African-American patients (7:1); the prevalence of sicca symptoms was lowest in Asian patients; a higher frequency of positive salivary biopsy was found in Hispanic and white patients.
10302,1112,"A north-south gradient was found with respect to a lower frequency of ocular involvement in northern countries for dry eyes and abnormal ocular tests in Europe (OR 0.46 and 0.44, respectively) and Asia (OR 0.18 and 0.49, respectively) compared with southern countries."
10303,1112,"Higher frequencies of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) were reported in northern countries in America (OR=1.48) and Asia (OR=3.80) while, in Europe, northern countries had lowest frequencies of ANAs (OR=0.67) and Ro/La (OR=0.69)."
10304,1112,CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence of a strong influence of geolocation and ethnicity on the phenotype of primary SjS at diagnosis.
10305,1113,PURPOSE: We present a case report and a comprehensive review of the literature concerning aseptic meningoencephalitis and Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
10306,1113,CASE REPORT: We report a 44-year-old woman of primary SS with initial presentation of aseptic meningoencephalitis and a reversible magnetic resonance image (MRI) lesion in the medulla.
10307,1113,"The diagnosis of primary SS based on ocular dryness, lacrimal hyposecretion, secretory and excretory dysfunction from sialocintigraphy, and positive anti-SS-A antibodies."
10308,1113,Corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapies reversed the neurological deficits and the MRI lesion.
10309,1113,CONCLUSION: Primary SS may have variable manifestations in the central nervous system which may precede the classic sicca symptoms.
10310,1113,SS should be investigated in cases of aseptic meningoencephalitis even without clinical signs of xerostomia or xerophthalmia.
10311,1113,MRI is useful in demonstrating brain lesions and in evaluating treatment efficacy of the SS.
10312,1114,"Primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) is usually a mild disease, but serious complications such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma-and hypothetically other malignancies-may develop."
10313,1114,The aim of this study was to evaluate both overall and specific incidence of cancer in a cohort of patients with pSS compared to the expected incidence in general population of Argentina.
10314,1114,"Retrospective analytic study of pSS patients fulfilling American-European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria, followed from the time of their diagnosis until the end of the study, death, loss of follow- up, or being given a diagnosis of cancer."
10315,1114,"Cancer incidence for the general population was obtained from GLOBOCAN 2018, and demographic information was obtained from the national institute for statistics and census."
10316,1114,Age- and sex-specific Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) were then calculated.
10317,1114,"One hundred fifty-seven patients, with a mean age of 57.8years (SD 18.3), were included."
10318,1114,"Mean patient follow-up duration was 7.37years (SD 4.2), contributing to a total of 1158 patient/years."
10319,1114,Fifteen patients developed a malignancy during follow-up.
10320,1114,Cancer incidence for pSS patients was compared with the general population's incidence through SIRs.
10321,1114,"Female patient's SIRs for overall cancer was 4.17 (95% CI 2.30-6.87), non-Hodgkin lymphoma 41.40 (95% CI 10.12-102.1), multiple myeloma 41.49 (95% CI 1.14-167.28), tongue cancer 44.4 (95% CI 1.23-177.31), uterus cancer 8.39 (95% CI 0.19-40.73), lung cancer 4.51 (95% CI 0.1-22.16), and breast cancer 3.76 (95% CI 1.04-9.45)."
10322,1114,"An increased overall cancer risk, and particularly for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, breast cancer and tongue cancer was observed in female pSS patients compared to control group."
10323,1115,AIM: The microRNA-155 (miR-155) is regarded as a central modulator of T-cell responses and could be a potential therapeutic target for certain inflammatory diseases.
10324,1115,"In our present study we analyzed the expression rate of miR-155 and its functionally linked gene, the suppressor gene of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
10325,1115,METHOD: We enrolled 23 pSS patients and 10 healthy individuals in the study.
10326,1115,The expression of miR-155 and SOCS1 gene were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
10327,1115,RESULTS: We observed the over-expression of miR-155 in the peripheral mononuclear cells of patients with pSS.
10328,1115,"Surprisingly, SOCS1 gene was also over-expressed in pSS patients."
10329,1115,"CONCLUSION: This unanticipated phenomenon might be a laboratory characteristic of Sjgren's syndrome, and presumably a consequence of the noteworthy difference in the pSS immune system reacting with Epstein-Barr virus."
10330,1116,"Our aim was to differentiate IgG4-related sialadenitis, primary Sjgren syndrome, and chronic obstructive submandibular sialadenitis by analysing clinical, radiographic, and pathological features."
10331,1116,"Fifty-five patients, 50, and 50 were enrolled, respectively and their baseline characteristics and serological, sialographic, and pathological findings compared."
10332,1116,"The male:female ratio for IgG4-related sialadenitis was 1:1.2 for primary Sjgren syndrome 1:15.7, and for chronic obstructive submandibular sialadenitis1:0.92."
10333,1116,"Numbers with enlarged salivary glands were 55, 16, and 50; with xerostomia 26, 48, and 0; with a history of allergy 26, 4, and 6, and with coexisting systemic disease 12, 19, and 0 (p=0.14)."
10334,1116,"Mean (SD) serum IgG4 concentrations were 109.1 (97.9), 4.9."
10335,1116,"(1.9) g/L, and 5.3 (1.6) g/L, p<0.001 in all cases."
10336,1116,"Sialography showed enlargement of the gland, dilatation of the duct, and slightly decreased secretory function in IgG4-related disease; obvious sialectasia and decreased secretory function in Sjgren syndrome; and dilatation of Wharton's duct and filling defects in obstructive sialadenitis."
10337,1116,"Histopathological examination showed lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with storiform fibrosis, lymphoplasmacytic inflammation and lymphoepithelial lesions, and dilatation of the duct with epithelial metaplasia in the three groups, respectively."
10338,1116,"The number of IgG4-positive plasma cells was 123 (45)/HPF, 8 (3)/HPF, and 5 (4)/HPF, while the IgG4-/IgG-positive cell ratio was 71.7 (13.9)%, 4.6 (2.5)%, 18.9 (19.7)%, respectively (p<0.001)."
10339,1116,"The three conditions have different clinical, radiographic, and pathological features that provide important clues to the differential diagnosis."
10340,1116,"Serological and histological tests are important, and comprehensive consideration is necessary."
10341,1117,"Our aim is to evaluate the complement component C4 (C4) and its fragment C4d (C4d) levels, focusing on their associations with other markers of B cells' activity in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
10342,1117,"Humoral factors C4, C4d, B cell-activating factor (BAFF),  and  free light chains (FLCs) and IgG (by immunoassay) were investigated in 58 patients with pSS and in 28 healthy controls."
10343,1117,"We observed significantly higher levels of BAFF,  and  FLC and IgG, and significantly lower level of C4 in pSS patients, while the level of C4d was similar in the both groups."
10344,1117,"Significantly higher levels of BAFF,  and  FLCs, IgG, and significantly lower C4 level were found in anti-SSA/SSB antibodies (Abs) seropositive pSS patients' group comparing with healthy controls."
10345,1117,Level of C4d was significantly lower in anti-SSA/SSB Abs seropositive pSS patients comparing with seronegative pSS patients and healthy controls.
10346,1117,"C4d correlated with C4, anti-SSB Abs level and / ratio."
10347,1117,Significantly higher  FLC and IgG levels were found in anti-SSA/SSB Abs seronegative pSS patients comparing with healthy controls.
10348,1117,Anti-SSA/SSB seropositivity in pSS patients is associated with the decreased level of C4d.
10349,1117,"These results show that C4d can be an appropriate marker of antibody response and complement activation in pSS patients with Abs, and possibly may show the more severe condition-exhaustion of C4."
10350,1117,Further studies are required to determine whether C4d assessment could be a relevant biomarker for the more severe condition and the worse prognosis of pSS.
10351,1118,"Anti-SSA/Ro and anti-La/SSB are the hallmark antibodies in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), being present in 60-70%."
10352,1118,"These antibodies have been associated with an earlier disease onset, glandular dysfunction and extraglandular manifestations as well as with other B cells activation markers."
10353,1118,"In addition an immunogenetic background is important for the autoantibody formation, having a stronger association with HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR3."
10354,1118,"Anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies are useful in the diagnosis of pSS and help to identify more ""active"" patients, however their association with response to treatment is unclear."
10355,1118,"Herein we review the evidence regarding the association of these antibodies with HLA background, demographic, clinical, glandular dysfunction, other serologic features and response to treatment in patients with pSS."
10356,1119,"OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate histopathologic, blood cellular, serologic, and clinical changes in response to abatacept treatment in patients with primary Sjgrens syndrome (SS)."
10357,1119,"METHODS: Blood, saliva, and minor salivary gland biopsy samples were obtained before and after the last of 8 doses of abatacept in 11 primary SS patients."
10358,1119,"The histologic data evaluated the numbers of lymphocytic foci and B and T cell subtypes (CD20+, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+)."
10359,1119,The numbers of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells were measured and the FoxP3:CD3 ratio was calculated.
10360,1119,Histologic data were compared with results from peripheral blood and with changes in saliva secretion.
10361,1119,RESULTS: The numbers of lymphocytic foci decreased significantly (P = 0.041).
10362,1119,Numbers of local FoxP3+ T cells decreased significantly in percentage of total lymphocytic infiltrates (P = 0.037).
10363,1119,"In the peripheral blood, B cells increased (P = 0.038)."
10364,1119,This was due to an expansion of the naive B cell pool (P = 0.034).
10365,1119,"When adjusting for disease duration, an increase was also noted for total lymphocytes (P = 0.044) and for CD4 cells (P = 0.009)."
10366,1119,"Gamma globulins decreased significantly(P = 0.005), but IgG reduction did not reach significance."
10367,1119,"Adjusted for disease duration, saliva production increased significantly (P = 0.029)."
10368,1119,"CONCLUSION: CTLA-4Ig treatment significantly reduces glandular inflammation in primary SS, induces several cellular changes, and increases saliva production."
10369,1119,"Remarkably, this increase in saliva production is significantly influenced by disease duration."
10370,1120,"Sjgren Syndrome (SS) is a systemic, autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands."
10371,1120,Different clinical associations have been described for each of the diverse autoantibodies found in SS patients.
10372,1120,"Antibodies directed against the Ro/La ribonucleoprotein complexes have been correlated with younger age, more severe dysfunction of the exocrine glands and a higher prevalence of extraglandular manifestations."
10373,1120,"Anti-nuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factors have been associated to extraglandular manifestations and an active immunological profile, while cryoglobulins are markers of more severe disease and correlate to lymphoma development and death."
10374,1120,Antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides are scarce in SS and have been linked in some cases to the development of non-erosive arthritis.
10375,1120,"Furthermore, the presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies and anti-smooth muscle antibodies in the sera of primary SS patients is considered indicative of primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis, respectively."
10376,1120,"In addition, anti-centromere antibodies have been associated with a clinical phenotype intermediate between primary SS and systemic sclerosis, while antibodies against carbonic anhydrase have been related to renal tubular acidosis."
10377,1120,"Finally, an association of anti-muscarinic antibodies with cytopenias and a higher disease activity has also been described in primary SS."
10378,1120,"In conclusion, although not all of the above mentioned antibodies are useful for predicting distinct patient subgroups in SS, knowledge of the clinical associations of the different autoantibody specificities encountered in SS can advance our understanding of the disease and improve patient management."
10379,1121,Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a diverse group of pulmonary disorders characterized by various patterns of inflammation and fibrosis in the interstitium of the lung.
10380,1121,"The underlying pathogenesis of ILDs is complex and associated with multiple rheumatologic conditions, such as systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, pollymyositis and dermatomyositis, Sjgren's syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus."
10381,1121,"As the disease progresses, excessive pulmonary fibrosis impairs alveolar gas exchange and damages pulmonary function."
10382,1121,"The common methods to diagnose ILDs, such as clinical manifestations, pulmonary function test, and radiological examinations are not specific for ILDs and not able to diagnose ILDs at the early stage due to their low sensitivity."
10383,1121,"So, the easy way is important to diagnose ILDs."
10384,1121,"One important biomarker for ILDs is the high-molecular-weight glycoprotein, Krebs von den Lungen-6(KL-6)."
10385,1121,"KL-6 encoded by the MUC1 gene is a mucin-like glycoprotein with high molecular weight and expressed predominantly on the cell surface of type II alveolar epithelial cells, and is detectable in the serum of patients with ILDs."
10386,1121,We here report a case of ILDs associated with dermatomyositis and secondary Sjgren's syndrome.
10387,1121,"A 60-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaints of debilitation, dry mouth, dyspnea and astasia."
10388,1121,"ILDs associated with dermatomyositis and secondary Sjgren's syndrome was diagnosed clinically when the following criteria were satisfied: (1) development of dyspnea within 2 months of presentation, (2) pulmonary dispersion dysfunction, (3) bilateral infiltrative shadows on chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT)."
10389,1121,"She was treated with prednisone 50 mg/d prior to admission, but the result of therapy was not good."
10390,1121,In our hospital she was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide and oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate.
10391,1121,"Subsequently, her serum KL-6 levels gradually decreased after treatment, pulmonary diffuse function improved, and the improvement in the clinical manifestation and HRCT findings were observed."
10392,1121,"Nevertheless, the combination treatment of glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide had contributed to the favourable outcomes."
10393,1121,"In conclusion, detection of serum KL-6 levels in ILDs associated with connective tissue diseases may be beneficial to making a definitive diagnosis, predicting the prognosis and monitoring the disease activity, which would be of great help in clinical practice."
10394,1121,"However, a well-designed clinical study with more patients and a longer follow-up period are required to arrive at a more conclusive judgment on the role of serum KL-6 in patients with ILDs."
10395,1122,The aim of this study was to evaluate neurological manifestations of primary Sjgrens syndrome (pSS) and investigate the etiology and pathogenesis of peripheral and central nervous complications in pSS.
10396,1122,"Thirty-two patients with pSS were enrolled in the present study, 20 of whom had neurological involvement plus sicca symptoms."
10397,1122,"The clinical features were evaluated by neurological examinations including nerve conduction study, magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and electroencephalogram."
10398,1122,The frequency of fever was significantly higher (P=0.006) in pSS with neurological involvement than in pSS without neurological involvement.
10399,1122,There was no statistical significance in other factors between the two groups.
10400,1122,"Peripheral nervous system (PNS), central nervous system (CNS), and both PNS and CNS involvements were revealed in 14, 3, and 3 patients, respectively."
10401,1122,Optic neuritis and trigeminal neuralgia were revealed frequently in cranial neuropathy.
10402,1122,Anti-aquaporin 4 antibody was detected in one patient with optic neuritis.
10403,1122,"Of the nine patients with polyneuropathy, eight patients presented pure sensory neuropathy including small fiber neuropathy (SFN)."
10404,1122,"pSS with SFN appeared to have no clinically abnormal features, including muscle weakness and decreasing deep tendon reflex."
10405,1122,Skin biopsy revealed epidermal nerve fiber degenerated in one pSS patient with pure sensory neuropathy who was diagnosed as having SFN.
10406,1122,"Our observations suggest that a number of mechanisms can be attributed to neurological involvements in pSS rather than just the mechanisms previously described (i.e., vasculitis and ganglioneuronitis)."
10407,1122,"Presumably, specific autoantibodies may directly induce injury of the nervous system."
10408,1123,The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on subjective and objective parameters of dry eye in patients with primary Sjogren's disease and to evaluate the association of tear fluid B-cell activating factor (BAFF) level with the response.
10409,1123,Thirty-two patients with primary Sjogren's disease were enrolled in this prospective study.
10410,1123,All patients included in the study completed at least a 48-month run-in period of using hydroxychloroquine.
10411,1123,Patients were then instructed to drop the treatment for 3 months.
10412,1123,"Baseline and post cessation of treatment (baseline and 3 months) evaluations included, subjective symptom scoring, fluorescein and lissamine green staining, Schirmer's test, tear break-up time (BUT) and tear fluid BAFF assessments."
10413,1123,"Significant worsening was observed in, tear break up-time (TBUT) (7.9  3.4 vs. 5.9  2.9, P < 0.001) lissamine green of staining of the ocular surface (1.3  0.9 vs. 1.8  0.8, P < 0.01) and corneal fluorescein staining scores (2.2  2.1 vs. 4.6  3.3, P < 0.003) between on and off HCQ treatment, respectively."
10414,1123,"Similarly, gritty sensation and burning sensation were significantly changed at week 12 compared to baseline evaluation (1.18  1.02 vs. 1.7  1.05, P < 0.007 and 1.1  1.0 vs. 1.6  1.2, P < 0.0, respectively)."
10415,1123,"Disease duration significantly correlated with baseline OSDI (r = 0.38, P < 0.04) and the average daily use of artificial tears (r = 0.36, P < 0.04)."
10416,1123,"The mean BAFF levels were 0.8  0.5 and 4.0  0.7 ng/ml for baseline and week 12 evaluation, respectively (P < 0.0001)."
10417,1123,The results of this study suggest that HCQ may alleviate symptoms and signs of dry eye in pSS and decreases tear fluid BAFF levels.
10418,1124,"AIMS Patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) are reported to have an increased severity of irritating bladder symptoms, including urinary frequency and urgency."
10419,1124,The mechanism remains unclear.
10420,1124,The aim of this study is to elucidate the possible etiologies underlying this problem.
10421,1124,"METHODS: Data from 23 female patients with SS (15 primary and 8 secondary) who were treated in the urology clinic for chronic, irritating bladder symptoms were studied."
10422,1124,"Evaluation of each subject is composed of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), bladder diary entries, and urodynamic studies, which also included an ice water test (IWT) to detect the presence of a C-fiber mediated micturition pathway."
10423,1124,Interstitial cystitis (IC) was diagnosed with post-hydrodilatation cystoscopic findings of glomerulations and a KCl test.
10424,1124,"RESULTS: These patients complained predominantly of overactive bladder symptoms (OAB), including frequency (n=20, 87%), nocturia (n=16, 66%), and urgency (n=12, 52%)."
10425,1124,"Based on the aforementioned evaluations, four patients (17%) had polyuria with normal bladder function, nine patients (39%) had detrusor overactivity (DO), seven patients (32%) had bladder hypersensitivity (including two patients (9%) diagnosed with IC), and three patients (13%) had negative findings."
10426,1124,"Ice water instillation neither elicited novel involuntary contractions, both in those with or without DO."
10427,1124,Five of the six patients (83%) with DO versus one of the four patients (25%) without DO responded to antimuscarinic therapy.
10428,1124,"CONCLUSIONS: Various factors contribute to the irritating bladder symptoms in patients with SS, with DO being predominant."
10429,1124,The LUTS developed in patients with SS are not due to any specific single etiology and that each patient must be individually carefully evaluated.
10430,1125,OBJECTIVE: Elevated serum IgG4 levels are an important hallmark for diagnosing IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) but can also be found and reported in other diseases.
10431,1125,The present study intended to compare the serum IgG4 levels in both IgG4-RD and non-IgG4-RD and determine the serum IgG4 levels in patients with IgG4-RD before and after glucocorticoid therapy.
10432,1125,METHODS: The study included 323 patients from Anhui Medical University Affiliated Provincial Hospital (China) and was conducted from July 2014-January 2016.
10433,1125,"A total of 25 patients were eventually diagnosed as having IgG4-RD, according to the IgG4-RD diagnostic criteria."
10434,1125,"Our study also included 108 patients with connective tissue disease, 94 patients with pancreatic lesions, 66 patients with bile duct lesions, 13 patients with carcinoma of the duodenal papilla and 20 control participants."
10435,1125,The assay for serum IgG4 detection was peformed using the nephelometric method.
10436,1125,"RESULTS: Elevated levels of serum IgG4 (>1.35g/L) were detected in all patients with IgG4-RD, and reduced levels of serum IgG4 (<1.35g/L) were found in all patients with non-IgG4-RD."
10437,1125,"The serum IgG4 level in patients with IgG4-RD after glucocorticoid therapy was significantly lower than that before glucocorticoid therapy (t = 2.426, P = 0.04)."
10438,1125,CONCLUSIONS: High levels of IgG4 were observed in IgG4-RD.
10439,1125,"However, a diagnosis of IgG4 disease can not only be dependent on the detection of elevated serum IgG4 levels but also may need clinical manifestations, serology, histopathology and other comprehensive information for verification."
10440,1126,"A 47-year-old woman presented with sicca symptoms, polyarthralgias, polymyalgias and dysphagia."
10441,1126,"She was found to have positive antinuclear, anti-SSA-Ro and anti-SSB-La antibodies."
10442,1126,"Slit lamp exam confirmed the presence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and the patient was diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome."
10443,1126,"Three years later, she was referred for evaluation of gait instability associated with recent falls."
10444,1126,"On physical examination, the patient was found to have bilateral ptosis, percussion myotonia, distal upper and lower extremity weakness, and a steppage gait."
10445,1126,Electromyography demonstrated electrical myotonia.
10446,1126,"Genetic testing revealed expanded CTG repeats (733 and 533) in the myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) protein kinase gene, confirming the diagnosis of DM1."
10447,1126,"Dysphagia, pain and eye discomfort may occur in both Sjgren's syndrome and DM1, and in this case, may have delayed the diagnosis of muscular dystrophy."
10448,1127,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review and compare the diagnostic accuracy of the screening enzyme immunoassay (SEIA) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) as anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) screening assays for patients with systemic rheumatic diseases (SRDs), including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjgren's syndrome (SS), and systemic sclerosis (SSc)."
10449,1127,"METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in the Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for articles published before August 2017."
10450,1127,A bivariate random effects model was used to calculate pooled diagnostic values.
10451,1127,"RESULTS: Thirty-three studies including 3976 combined SRDs, 2839 SLE, 610 SS, and 1002 SSc patients and 11,716 non-healthy and 8408 healthy controls were available for the meta-analysis."
10452,1127,"The summary sensitivities of SEIA vs. IIF were 87.4% vs 88.4% for combined SRDs, 89.4% vs. 95.2% for SLE, 88.7% vs. 88.4% for SS, and 85.4% vs. 93.6% for SSc, respectively."
10453,1127,"Meanwhile, the summary specificities of SEIA vs. IIF were 79.7% vs.78.9% for combined SRDs, 89.1% vs. 83.3% for SLE, 89.9% vs. 86.8% for SS, and 92.8% vs. 84.2% for SSc, respectively."
10454,1127,"Although the differences in sensitivity and specificity between SEIA and IIF were not significant in most subgroups, the summary sensitivity of SLE presented statistically significant changes."
10455,1127,CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic meta-analysis demonstrates that both SEIA and IIF are useful to detect ANAs for SRDs.
10456,1127,"Between the two assays, IIF is a more sensitive screening assay than SEIA, particularly in patients with SLE."
10457,1127,"SEIA is comparable to IIF, considering the specificity and standardization."
10458,1128,Autoimmune diseases are immune system disorders in which immune cells cannot distinguish self-antigens from foreign ones.
10459,1128,The current criteria for autoimmune disease diagnosis are based on clinical manifestations and laboratory tests.
10460,1128,"However, none of these markers shows both high sensitivity and specificity."
10461,1128,"In addition, some autoimmune diseases, for example, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), are highly heterogeneous and often exhibit various manifestations."
10462,1128,"On the other hand, certain autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren's syndrome versus SLE, share similar symptoms and autoantibodies, which also causes difficulties in diagnosis."
10463,1128,"Therefore, biomarkers that have both high sensitivity and high specificity for diagnosis, reflect disease activity and predict drug response are necessary."
10464,1128,An increasing number of publications have proposed the abnormal epigenetic modifications as biomarkers of autoimmune diseases.
10465,1128,"Therefore, this review will comprehensively summarize the epigenetic progress in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders and unearth potential biomarkers that might be appropriate for disease diagnosis and prediction."
10466,1129,INTRODUCTION: The EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) is an index of primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS) systemic activity.
10467,1129,OBJECTIVE: To perform the ESSDAI transcultural adaptation into Brazilian Portuguese.
10468,1129,METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study with 62 patients with PSS according to the criteria of the 2002 American-European Consensus.
10469,1129,"Six stages were conducted: conceptual, item, semantic, operational, functional, and measurement equivalences (interobserver reproducibility and construct validity)."
10470,1129,"For the validity assessment, the ESSDAI was compared with the Physician's Global Assessment (PhGA), the Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (SSDAI), and the Sjgren's Systemic Clinical Activity Index (SCAI)."
10471,1129,"Patients were classified by a specialist physician into two groups according to disease activity (active and inactive), and according to the intention-to-treat (increase in therapy and no increase in therapy)."
10472,1129,The ESSDAI was tested in these groups.
10473,1129,"The following statistical tests were used: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Bland-Altman plot for reproducibility, and Spearman's correlation coefficient (r s) and Mann-Whitney's test for validity (P < 0.05 and 95% CI)."
10474,1129,RESULTS: The mean ESSDAI score was 4.95  6.73.
10475,1129,The reproducibility obtained a strong ICC of 0.89 and good agreement.
10476,1129,"When compared with other indices, it showed a strong r s with PhGA (0.83; P < 0.000), a moderate r s with SSDAI (0.658; P < 0.000) and a weak r s with the SCAI (0.411; P = 0.001)."
10477,1129,"The group ""active"" and the group "" increase in therapy"" had higher ESSDAI values (P = 0.000)."
10478,1129,"CONCLUSION: The Brazilian Portuguese version of ESSDAI was shown to be adaptable, reproducible, and valid for this language."
10479,1130,The salivary glands belong to the exocrine glands.
10480,1130,"There are tree main pairs of salivary glands: parotid, submandibular, sublingual."
10481,1130,"Several modalities are used for salivary gland imaging, such as sonography, computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging."
10482,1130,The aim of these methods is mainly to present morphological impairment.
10483,1130,Parenchymal function and excretion function of all salivary glands can be quantified by scintigraphy.
10484,1130,After single intravenous injection of 99mTc-pertechnetate sequential images are acquired up to 25-40 minutes.
10485,1130,Usually about fifteen minutes postinjection 3 ml of lemon juice are administered intraorally as sialogogue.
10486,1130,"Salivary scintigraphy can estimate the severity of salivary gland involvement and function disorders, which may not be accurately reflected by the morphological damage."
10487,1130,"The clinical impact of scintigraphy has been reported in multiple salivary glands diseases, such as Sjogren's syndrome, sialolithiasis with or without parenchymal damage, iatrogenic irradiation of the salivary glands for therapy of head and neck tumors or radioiodine treatment of thyroid cancer."
10488,1130,No other method can give so much information about function of salivary glands.
10489,1130,"Scintigraphy is noninvasive examination, easy to perform, reproducible and well-tolerated by the patient."
10490,1131,Previous studies suggested a pathological role for the death decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatic arthritis (RA).
10491,1131,"Herein, the expression of DcR3 in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and the relationship with clinical characteristics were investigated."
10492,1131,The serum DcR3 levels of pSS patients and healthy controls were measured by ELISA.
10493,1131,Pearson's correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the DcR3 levels with the clinical characterstics of pSS patients.
10494,1131,"Additionally, the DcR3 expression in salivary glands of pSS patients was investigated by the immunohistochemistry method."
10495,1131,"The serum DcR3 expression in pSS patients was significantly higher than healthy controls (p<0.001), especially in new onset pSS patients (p=0.036)."
10496,1131,"Moreover, Pearson's correlation analysis show that DcR3 levels were positively correlated with age (p=0.013), platelet (PLT) (p=0.002), hemoglobin (Hb) (p=0.004), Sjgren's syndrome disease damage activity index (SSDAI) score (p=0.005), Sjgren's syndrome disease damage index (SSDDI) score (p<0.001) and EULAR Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI) score (p=0.010)."
10497,1131,"Furthermore, the DcR3 levels were significantly lower when the pSS patients were treated with the disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs."
10498,1131,"At last, DcR3 expression in salivary glands of pSS patients was significantly higher than healthy controls."
10499,1131,"The DcR3 expression was significantly elevated in the pSS patients and positively correlated with the clinical characteristics, and it might be an important factor involved in the progression of pSS patients and could be a potential therapeutic target."
10500,1132,"This article reviews the diagnostic issues and the therapeutic management of small fibre neuropathy (SFN), and a detailed literature analysis of its association with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
10501,1132,"A diagnosis of SFN should be raised in the presence of diffuse neuropathic painful manifestations (burning sensation, paresthesia, pricking, allodynia or hyperesthesia) and neurovegetative signs."
10502,1132,The neurological examination and the electroneuromyogram are usually normal.
10503,1132,"The diagnosis of SFN can be confirmed by the evidence of decreased intra-epidermal nerve fibre density after a skin punch biopsy or the presence of abnormal nonconventional neurophysiological tests exploring the A-delta and C small nerve fibres (laser-evoked potentials, quantitative sensory tests, cutaneous sympathic reflex, autonomic function tests)."
10504,1132,"The association of SFN and pSS has been scarcely evaluated, probably because of its lack of awareness and the low availability of the required diagnostic procedures."
10505,1132,"According to our literature review, pSS may be present in 9 to 30% of patients with SFN."
10506,1132,"Conversely, a pure SFN is present in 3 to 9% of patients with pSS where it may represent 25 to 35% of pSS-associated peripheral neuropathies."
10507,1132,The treatment of SFN is mainly symptomatic and based on antalgic neuropsychotropic drugs and conventional analgesics.
10508,1132,Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs are usually unsuccessful.
10509,1132,The effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulins is only supported by a few case reports.
10510,1132,SFN deserves to be separately evaluated among pSS-associated peripheral neuropathies.
10511,1132,"This requires a better availability of the appropriate diagnostic procedures, the investigation of underlying immunopathological mechanisms and the assessment of the new treatments recently proposed in pSS, mainly rituximab."
10512,1133,A 61-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjgren syndrome presented with a two-month history of symptomatic nodules on the buttocks and thighs that progressed to involve the dorsal aspects of the hands.
10513,1133,"On examination, infiltrative papules, nodules, and plaques were present in these regions."
10514,1133,"Biopsy specimens demonstrated granulomatous inflammation and acid-fast bacilli with the use of a Fite stain, although a culture and polymerase chain reaction analysis were negative."
10515,1133,The patient continues to improve on long-term clarithromycin therapy.
10516,1133,"Atypical mycobacterial infections are becoming more common, especially in immunocompromised patients."
10517,1133,"Antimicrobial therapy, either with a single agent or multiple agents, often is prolonged."
10518,1133,"A high index of suspicion is warranted in immunocompromised patients, which includes those with connective-tissue diseases that are active or that require immunosuppression."
10519,1133,"In these patients, the differential diagnosis includes infectious as well as inflammatory, reactive, or neoplastic processes."
10520,1134,"After immunosuppressive-induced infections, interstitial lung disease (ILD) is one of the most serious pulmonary complications associated with connective tissue diseases (CTD)."
10521,1134,"Although it is common for ILD to be diagnosed concurrent with or after CTD, some patients will present with ILD years prior to receiving a diagnosis of CTD."
10522,1134,The clinical approach involves an examination of the extrathoracic symptoms (suggestive of CTD) and the evaluation of respiratory disability.
10523,1134,Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia is the most common histological finding in patients with CTD.
10524,1134,The management of patients with CTD-associated ILD is optimized by multidisciplinary collaboration.
10525,1134,"ILD-CTD are treated through anti-inflammatory medication, immunosuppressants and biological agents."
10526,1135,OBJECTIVE: Clinical expression of SS shows considerable interpatient heterogeneity.
10527,1135,"Thus, the aim of this study was to assess whether individual salivary proteomic profiles provide a framework for identification of disease-phenotype-driven biomarker signatures."
10528,1135,"METHODS: Using a 187-plex capture antibody-based assay, proteomic biomarker profiles from unstimulated whole saliva were generated from a SS-cohort representing six clinically distinct disease phenotypes."
10529,1135,Discriminant function analyses identified the most powerful biomarker signatures for correct recapitulation of each patient's status with respect to hyposalivation and histopathological features of salivary gland inflammation.
10530,1135,"In addition, gene ontology-based network analyses allowed systematic interpretation of the molecular patterns underlying these specific disease features."
10531,1135,RESULTS: Presentation of hyposalivation was associated with significant alteration in 22 out of 119 reliably detectable biomarkers.
10532,1135,"Thereof, a 4-plex signature allowed accurate prediction of salivary gland function for >80% of the cases."
10533,1135,"With respect to histopathological features, the most distinct profiles were identified in conjunction with ectopic germinal centres."
10534,1135,"Selected from the 13 analytes relevant here, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, thrombospondin 1 and peptide YY would recapitulate the presence or absence of tertiary lymphoid organization for 93.8% of the patients."
10535,1135,"Whereas functional annotation of alterations associated with hyposalivation identified the IL1 system as a dominant pro-inflammatory component, changes observed in context with ectopic lymphoid organization revealed specific shifts in chemotactic profiles and altered regulation of apoptotic processes."
10536,1135,CONCLUSION: Multivariate analyses of a patient's salivary proteome could reliably recapitulate specific aspects of SS disease.
10537,1135,"Accessible and repetitively collectable, such biomarker signatures harbour great potential for patient subclassification and subsequent follow-up."
10538,1136,"Chronic inflammation of the ocular surface in Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is associated with a vision-threatening, phenotypic change of the ocular surface, which converts from a nonkeratinized, stratified squamous epithelium to a nonsecretory, keratinized epithelium."
10539,1136,This pathological process is known as squamous metaplasia.
10540,1136,"Based on a significant correlation between ocular surface interleukin (IL)-1beta expression and squamous metaplasia in patients with SS, we investigated the role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of squamous metaplasia in an animal model that mimics the clinical characteristics of SS."
10541,1136,"Using autoimmune-regulator (aire)-deficient mice, we assessed lacrimal gland and ocular surface immunopathology by quantifying the infiltration of major histocompatibility complex class II(+) (I-A(d+)) dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cells."
10542,1136,"We examined squamous metaplasia using a biomarker of keratinization, small proline-rich protein 1B."
10543,1136,We used lissamine green staining as a readout for ocular surface epitheliopathy and Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff histochemical analysis to characterize goblet cell muco-glycoconjugates.
10544,1136,"Within 8 weeks, the eyes of aire-deficient mice were pathologically keratinized with significant epithelial damage and altered mucin glycosylation."
10545,1136,"Although knockdown of IL-1 receptor 1 did not attenuate lymphocytic infiltration of the lacrimal gland or eye, it significantly reduced ocular surface keratinization, epitheliopathy, and muco-glycoconjugate acidification."
10546,1136,These data demonstrate a phenotypic modulation role for IL-1 in the pathogenesis of squamous metaplasia and suggest that IL-1 receptor 1-targeted therapies may be beneficial for treating ocular surface disease associated with SS.
10547,1137,OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of abatacept in patients with early and active primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
10548,1137,"METHODS: All 15 patients (12 women, three men) included in the open-label Active Sjgren Abatacept Pilot study met the revised American-European Consensus Group criteria for pSS and were biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug-naive."
10549,1137,"Patients were treated with eight intravenous abatacept infusions on days 1, 15 and 29 and every 4 weeks thereafter."
10550,1137,"Follow-up was conducted at 4, 12, 24 (on treatment), 36 and 48 weeks (off treatment)."
10551,1137,Disease activity was assessed with European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) and EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI).
10552,1137,"Several other functional, laboratory and subjective variables were analysed."
10553,1137,Generalised estimating equations were used to analyse parameters over time.
10554,1137,"RESULTS: ESSDAI, ESSPRI, rheumatoid factor and IgG levels decreased significantly during abatacept treatment and increased post-treatment."
10555,1137,Salivary and lacrimal gland function did not change during treatment.
10556,1137,Fatigue and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) improved significantly during treatment.
10557,1137,No serious side effects or infections were seen.
10558,1137,"CONCLUSIONS: In this open-label study, abatacept treatment is effective, safe and well tolerated, and results in improved disease activity, laboratory parameters, fatigue and HR-QoL in patients with early and active pSS."
10559,1137,TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 2009-015558-40.
10560,1138,"IgG4-related disease is a distinct clinical entity, whose characteristic features are the following; Serum IgG4 is prominently elevated, IgG4-positive plasma cells infiltrate in involved tissues, various mass-forming lesions with fibrosis develop in a timely and spatial manner and the response to corticosteroids is prompt and good."
10561,1138,IgG4-related diseases mainly target two organs.
10562,1138,"One is the pancreas (autoimmune pancreatitis; AIP), and the other comprises the lacrimal and salivary glands, the clinical phenotype is Mikulicz's disease (MD)."
10563,1138,MD has long been considered a manifestation of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
10564,1138,"However, we noticed several clinical differences in case of MD from SS; no deflection of female sex differences, mild sicca syndrome, good response to corticosteroids, no positivity of anti-SS-A/SS-B antibodies."
10565,1138,"In addition, elevated level of serum IgG4 and abundant infiltration of plasma cells expressing IgG4 were reported in MD patients."
10566,1138,Those are common features of IgG4-related diseases.
10567,1138,"MD often coexisted with IgG4-related diseases such as AIP, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and IgG4-associated nephropathy."
10568,1138,"Based on those findings, it has been considered to recognize IgG4-related diseases including MD as a new clinical entity."
10569,1138,The etiology of IgG4-related systemic diseases remains to be elucidated.
10570,1138,It is necessary to accumulate and analyze larger data from patients worldwide.
10571,1139,"OBJECTIVE: To establish a point-scoring diagnostic system for Sjgren's syndrome (SS) based on quantified SPECT imaging of salivary gland, and evaluate its feasibility and performance compared with 2002 AECG criteria and 2012 ACR criteria."
10572,1139,METHODS: 213 patients with suspected SS enrolled in this study.
10573,1139,The related clinical data of all patients were collected.
10574,1139,All patients were evaluated and grouped on a clinical basis and posttreatment follow-up by rheumatology specialists as the unified standard (SS group with 149 cases and nSS group with 64 cases).
10575,1139,"From SPECT imaging of salivary gland, Tmax, UImax, Ts and EFs were derived for bilateral parotid and submandibular glands, and compared between the groups."
10576,1139,A point-scoring diagnostic system for SS was established based on the quantified SPECT imaging of salivary gland.
10577,1139,"We estimated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy for the new diagnostic system, compared with 2002 AECG criteria and 2012 ACR criteria."
10578,1139,"RESULTS: When 7.0 was used as the cut-off point, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy for the new point-scoring system in diagnosing SS were 89.93% (134/149), 93.75% (60/64), 97.10% (134/138), 80.00% (60/75) and 91.08% (194/213), respectively."
10579,1139,"The new point-scoring diagnostic system based on quantified SPECT imaging of salivary gland keeps the specificity comparatively to 2002 AECG criteria and 2012 ACR criteria, but improves the sensitivity significantly (P<0.01)."
10580,1139,"CONCLUSION: The new point-scoring diagnostic system for SS based on quantified SPECT imaging of salivary gland may be superior to 2002 AECG criteria and 2012 ACR criteria, with higher sensitivity and similar specificity in the diagnosis of SS."
10581,1139,"Additionally, it also has good feasibility in the clinical settings."
10582,1140,"OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the pattern of oral yeast colonization of Sjgren's syndrome patients and its correlation to salivary flow rates, age, and time of the disease progression."
10583,1140,MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saliva and swab specimens were obtained from 45 patients (primary Sjgren's syndrome=15/ secondary Sjgren's syndrome=15/ healthy controls=15).
10584,1140,Yeast species were identified using culture method through chromogenic medium followed by polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing.
10585,1140,RESULTS: Eleven species from six different genera were detected.
10586,1140,"The most prevalent species found was Candida albicans followed by Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida krusei."
10587,1140,Both groups of Sjgren's syndrome showed higher counts of C.albicans (Total and CFU counts) when compared to control group.
10588,1140,"In contrast, a greater variety of yeast species was identified on samples of the control group."
10589,1140,"CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that C.albicans is the most prevalent yeast, but also that a variety of other yeast species can colonize the oral cavity of Sjogren's syndrome patients."
10590,1140,The identification of most of the colonies was not obtained by culturing-PCR methods combined.
10591,1141,Sicca complaints (sensation of dry mouth and/or eyes) are present in about a quarter of the individuals above the age of 65 years old and are mainly due to medication.
10592,1141,"However, physiological changes that occur during aging might also lead to a diminished glandular function."
10593,1141,"These age-related changes are, at least in part, to be the consequence of decreased androgen levels."
10594,1141,"In addition to these physiological effects that occur during normal aging, sicca complaints can also be caused by Sjgren's syndrome (SS): a systemic auto-inflammatory disorder mainly affecting exocrine glands."
10595,1141,"Genetic factors, lowered levels of gonadal hormones and (viral) infections appear to contribute to the etiology of the syndrome."
10596,1141,"The incidence of SS is higher among aged individuals, which might be due to earlier diagnosis, as the onset of SS in an individual with age-related exocrine gland dysfunction lowers the threshold for sicca complaints."
10597,1141,"On the other hand, physiological aging might be considered as a risk factor for development of SS, resulting in a faster development of the syndrome."
10598,1141,"Differentiating physiological sicca complaints from SS in the elderly can be challenging, since apparently healthy individuals might present with auto-antibodies and lymphocytic infiltrates in salivary glands might be present as well."
10599,1141,"The drop in the level of androgens and estrogens upon aging, immunosenescence and pro-inflammatory features of the aging immune system may all contribute to the etiology of pSS in the elderly."
10600,1141,"In this review, we describe the physiological effects of aging and the influence of SS on exocrine gland morphology and function."
10601,1142,"We present a case of acute pyelonephritis with right hydronephrosis in a middle-aged woman, who had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and Sjgren's syndrome."
10602,1142,"She had successfully treated with antibiotics, however, ureteral stenosis sustained."
10603,1142,She underwent ureteroscopy and stenting of right ureter.
10604,1142,Biopsy specimen revealed submucosal amyloid deposition in the interstitium overlying a benign urothelium.
10605,1142,Amyloid protein was positive for transthyretin (TTR) by immunohistochemistry and amyloid deposition was not demonstrated in other organs.
10606,1142,The patient's TTR genes were wild type and she was diagnosed with wild-type ATTR (ATTR wt) amyloidosis.
10607,1142,"This is the first report about symptomatic ATTR wt amyloidosis, which was also called 'systemic senile amyloidosis (SSA)' in the ureter."
10608,1142,We should aware that SSA can occur at younger age and cause symptomatic ureteral stenosis.
10609,1142,Further investigation is needed to clarify the association of autoimmune diseases to develop ATTR wt amyloidosis.
10610,1143,"OBJECTIVE: HCQ is frequently used to treat primary SS (pSS), but evidence for its efficacy is limited."
10611,1143,"HCQ blocks IFN activation, which is present in half of the pSS patients."
10612,1143,The effect of HCQ treatment on the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) was studied in pSS.
10613,1143,"Furthermore, HCQ-treated patients were stratified based on IFN activation and differences in disease activity and clinical parameters were studied."
10614,1143,"METHODS: Expression of ISGs and IFN scores was determined in 77 patients, who were previously enrolled in the placebo-controlled JOQUER trial."
10615,1143,Patients were treated for 24 weeks with 400 mg/d HCQ or placebo.
10616,1143,RESULTS: HCQ treatment reduced IFN scores and expression of ISGs compared with the placebo-treated group.
10617,1143,"HCQ reduced ESR, IgG and IgM levels independently of the patients' IFN activation status."
10618,1143,"No differences in EULAR SS disease activity index or EULAR SS patient reported index scores were observed after HCQ treatment, even after IFN stratification."
10619,1143,CONCLUSION: Treatment for 24 weeks with HCQ significantly reduced type I IFN scores and ISG-expression compared with the placebo-treated group.
10620,1143,"HCQ reduced several laboratory parameters, but failed to improve clinical response."
10621,1143,"This suggests that in pSS, type I IFN is associated to some laboratory parameters abnormalities, but not related to the clinical response."
10622,1144,"INTRODUCTION: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) are inflammatory systemic autoimmune diseases (SADs) that share several clinical and pathological features."
10623,1144,The shared biological mechanisms are not yet fully characterized.
10624,1144,The objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis using publicly available gene expression data about the three diseases to identify shared gene expression signatures and overlapping biological processes.
10625,1144,METHODS: Previously reported gene expression datasets were selected and downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database.
10626,1144,Normalization and initial preprocessing were performed using the statistical programming language R and random effects model-based meta-analysis was carried out using INMEX software.
10627,1144,Functional analysis of over- and underexpressed genes was done using the GeneCodis tool.
10628,1144,"RESULTS: The gene expression meta-analysis revealed a SAD signature composed of 371 differentially expressed genes in patients and healthy controls, 187 of which were underexpressed and 184 overexpressed."
10629,1144,"Many of these genes have previously been reported as significant biomarkers for individual diseases, but others provide new clues to the shared pathological state."
10630,1144,"Functional analysis showed that overexpressed genes were involved mainly in immune and inflammatory responses, mitotic cell cycles, cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, apoptotic processes, type I interferon-mediated signaling pathways and responses to viruses."
10631,1144,Underexpressed genes were involved primarily in inhibition of protein synthesis.
10632,1144,"CONCLUSIONS: We define a common gene expression signature for SLE, RA and SjS."
10633,1144,The analysis of this signature revealed relevant biological processes that may play important roles in the shared development of these pathologies.
10634,1145,"Bell palsy occurs in different rheumatic diseases, causes hemifacial weakness, and targets the motor branch of the 7th cranial nerve."
10635,1145,"Severe, persistent, and refractory otalgia having features of neuropathic pain (ie, burning and allodynic) does not characteristically occur with Bell palsy."
10636,1145,"Whereas aberrant regeneration of the 7th cranial nerve occurring after a Bell palsy may lead to a variety of clinical findings, hemifacial spasm only rarely occurs."
10637,1145,"We identified in 3 rheumatic disease patients (2 with Sjgren syndrome, 1 with rheumatoid arthritis) a previously unreported neurological syndrome of facial weakness, otalgia with neuropathic pain features, and hemifacial spasm."
10638,1145,"We characterized symptoms, examination findings, and response to therapy."
10639,1145,"All 3 patients experienced vertigo, as well as severe otalgia which persisted after mild facial weakness had completely resolved within 1 to 4 weeks."
10640,1145,The allodynic nature of otalgia was striking.
10641,1145,"Two patients were rendered homebound, as even the barest graze of outdoor breezes caused intolerable ear pain."
10642,1145,Patients developed hemifacial spasm either at the time of or within 3 months of facial weakness.
10643,1145,"Two patients had a polyphasic course, with recurrent episodes of facial weakness and increased otalgia."
10644,1145,"In all cases, otalgia and hemifacial spasm were unresponsive to neuropathic pain regimens, but responded in 1 case to intravenous immunoglobulin therapy."
10645,1145,No patients had vesicles or varicella zoster virus in spinal-fluid studies.
10646,1145,"We have defined a novel neurological syndrome in 3 rheumatic disease patients, characterized by facial weakness, otalgia, and hemifacial spasm."
10647,1145,"As described in infectious disorders, the combination of otalgia, facial weakness, and 8th cranial nerve deficits suggests damage to the geniculate ganglia (ie, the sensory ganglia of the 7th cranial nerve), with contiguous involvement of other cranial nerves causing facial weakness and vertigo."
10648,1145,"However, the relapsing nature and association with hemifacial spasm constitute a unique part of this neurological syndrome."
10649,1146,OBJECTIVE: Dependence on invasive procedures for classification of patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) hampers timely diagnosis and suitable patient followup.
10650,1146,The aim of this study was to recapitulate the diagnosis of SS through noninvasive means and to define the biologic state of SS patients' salivary glands.
10651,1146,"METHODS: Using a 187-plex capture antibody-based assay, salivary proteomic biomarker profiles were generated from patients with primary SS, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and asymptomatic controls."
10652,1146,Discriminant function analyses and Gene Ontology-based network analyses allowed data analyses with a reductionist approach and with a focus on systems biology.
10653,1146,"RESULTS: Characterized by significant changes in 61 and 55 proteins, respectively, the salivary proteome of SS patients appeared profoundly altered compared to that of individuals without SS."
10654,1146,"On this basis, 4-plex and 6-plex biomarker signatures, both including interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and clusterin, achieved accurate prediction of an individual's group membership for at least 94% of cases."
10655,1146,"Of note, all misclassified SS patients presented with ectopic germinal center-like structures."
10656,1146,"Systematic inference of biologic meaning identified SS-related protein patterns delineating B cell-dominated immune responses, macrophage differentiation, and signs of T cell chemotaxis."
10657,1146,"In addition, proteomic Multi-Analyte Profiles provided insight about proteins related to collagen, cytokine, and growth factor synthesis as well as lipid transport."
10658,1146,CONCLUSION: The SS-related molecular landscape conveyed by saliva showed great congruence with histopathologic features found in SS and advances understanding of this disease at a molecular level.
10659,1146,Such salivary biomarker signatures harbor great potential for improving timeliness of SS diagnosis and enabling suitable patient followup.
10660,1147,A 31-year-old woman with no significant past medical or family history was admitted with complaints of general weakness.
10661,1147,"Laboratory tests revealed: serum potassium 3.0 mEq/L, arterial blood pH 7.28, serum bicarbonate 17.8 mEq/L and urinary pH 7.0."
10662,1147,Double-labeling confocal fluorescence microscopy using H(+)-ATPase and pendrin antibodies demonstrated a decreased expression of these proteins in the patient's renal collecting duct compared to normal controls.
10663,1147,"Anti-Sjgren's-syndrome-related antigen A (Anti-Ro/SS-A) and anti-Sjgren's syndrome type B (anti-La/SS-B) antibodies were strongly positive with very high titers, consistent with Sjgren's syndrome."
10664,1147,We present a case of distal renal tubular acidosis-associated Sjgren's syndrome with a defect in H(+)-ATPase and pendrin in the renal collecting duct.
10665,1148,The purpose of this research was to study ocular surface inflammation in relation to systemic disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with or without secondary Sjgren's syndrome (SSII and non-SSII respectively).
10666,1148,The study was conducted in two phases.
10667,1148,"In phase I, 12 patients with active RA SSII and 12 with active RA non-SSII were consecutively enrolled."
10668,1148,Each completed an Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and underwent a full eye exam and invivo confocal microscopy examination of the cornea.
10669,1148,"Tear fluid samples were collected in sponges and analyzed for IL-1, -6, and -8, and TNF-."
10670,1148,When RA activity was suppressed by systemic treatment the patients entered phase II of the study in which all of the phase I examinations were repeated.
10671,1148,"In RA SSII patients, OSDI, fluorescein staining dendritic cell density, and concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 decreased significantly (P<0.01) between phases I and II."
10672,1148,Tear breakup time scores increased significantly.
10673,1148,"For RA non-SSII patients, there were no significant differences between phases I and II."
10674,1148,"Differences in the clinical, cellular and cytokine responsiveness to systemic RA treatments show that the ocular surface pathology is dissimilar for RA SSII and RA non-SSII patients."
10675,1149,Sjgren syndrome (SS) has been associated with the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).
10676,1149,"From a cohort of 584 SS patients followed in our department from 1980 to 2010, we retrospectively analyzed 53 consecutive NHL cases."
10677,1149,"Considerations included histologic type, clinical manifestation and NHL staging, treatment, response rate and overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and standardized mortality ratio (SMR).Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas constituted the majority (59%) of NHL subtypes, followed by nodal marginal zone lymphomas (NMZLs) (15%) and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) (15%)."
10678,1149,Six lymphoma patients died during the median follow-up of 40.8 months.
10679,1149,"The corresponding age/sex-adjusted SMR of SS with and without NHLs versus the general population was 3.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-6.76) and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.79-1.45), respectively."
10680,1149,"A ""watch and wait"" policy was adopted for 9 patients with asymptomatic localized salivary MALT lymphomas."
10681,1149,Eight patients with limited-stage MALT lymphomas and extraglandular manifestations were treated with rituximab.
10682,1149,Ten MALT lymphoma patients with disseminated disease received chemotherapy with or without rituximab.
10683,1149,"The 3-year OS and EFS in patients with MALT lymphomas was 97% and 78%, respectively."
10684,1149,"Rituximab plus CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) was the chosen therapeutic intervention for patients with DLBCLs."
10685,1149,"A successful outcome was recorded for this group, with 100% OS and EFS at 3 years."
10686,1149,"Patients with NMZLs had a less favorable outcome, with a 3-year OS of 80% and EFS of 53%."
10687,1149,Our results describe the course and prognosis of SS-associated NHL and highlight the need for a risk-stratified treatment approach.
10688,1150,"OBJECTIVE: We studied the risk of dementia in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) using a nationwide, population-based cohort in Taiwan."
10689,1150,METHODS: Our study analyzed the medical data of the Taiwanese population from 2000 to 2014.
10690,1150,"We identified 17,072 patients with pSS and 68,270 controls."
10691,1150,"Dementia risk was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model stratified by sex, age, and comorbidities."
10692,1150,RESULTS: A higher incidence of dementia development in the pSS group during the observation period (P=0.0001).
10693,1150,"In multivariate analysis adjusted by age groups, gender, and the comorbidities, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of developing dementia was 1.246 (95% CI 1.123-1.384) times greater in the pSS group than in the non-pSS group."
10694,1150,"When stratified by sex, age, and comorbidities, the patients with pSS less than 60years (aHR 1.67, 95% CI 1.16-2.41), and without any comorbidity (aHR 2.27, 95% CI 1.76-2.93) were particularly associated with a higher risk of dementia."
10695,1150,"Furthermore, the patients with pSS combined with any other comorbidity had an additionally higher risk of dementia (aHR: 3.978, 95% CI 3.309-4.782), also suggesting that pSS was an independent risk factor for the development of dementia."
10696,1150,INTERPRETATION: Primary Sjogren's syndrome is associated with increased dementia risk and further study is needed to understand why and what the specific dementia phenotypes are.
10697,1151,"This study aims at analyzing the Th17/Treg cell level and clinical characteristics of the peripheral blood of patients with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) complicated with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) so as to deepen the understanding of this disease and seek for its possible onset mechanism.A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 24 patients [8 (33%) males and 16 (67%) females] with SS complicated with primary biliary cirrhosis, 50 patients with primary SS and 93 healthy volunteers."
10698,1151,"These patients were divided into 3 groups: experimental group (SS+PBC), control group (SS) and healthy group."
10699,1151,"Then, peripheral blood was collected and flow cytometry was conducted to detect level of Th17 cells and Treg cells."
10700,1151,A fully automatic biochemical detector was used to detect the corresponding liver function index.
10701,1151,"The correlation analysis was made based on the clinical manifestations and biochemical characteristics.Compared with the healthy group and control group, the experimental group had the highest Th17/Treg cell ratio, and Th17 cell frequency was significantly increased (P<.05)."
10702,1151,"Furthermore, ALT, AST, ALP, -GT, TBIL, and other indexes were positively correlated to the Th17/Treg ratio (P<.05).Th17/Treg cell level and its ratio in peripheral blood of patients with SS complicated with primary biliary cirrhosis were significantly unbalanced, indicating that Th17 cells participate in the onset of this disease to a large extent."
10703,1151,"Furthermore, the Th17/Treg ratio has a certain correlation with some of the liver function indexes, on which a stratified analysis could be made furtherly according to the seriousness of the conditions."
10704,1152,"While severe adverse effects are rare, evidence suggests significant physiological effects may be associated with the use of electrical incapacitation devices, or TASERs."
10705,1152,"In this case, a 28 year old Caucasian female with chronic, stable systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was voluntarily tased in a work-related training procedure."
10706,1152,"Days later, she presented to the emergency room with an acute flare of her lupus and a constellation of symptoms that lead to new diagnoses of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), Raynaud phenomenon, acute lower left extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and diffuse bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs)."
10707,1152,"Due to the temporal relationship of these complications and this patient's history of autoimmune disorders, it is reasonable to believe that an APS was both induced by the tasing event and associated with her lupus."
10708,1153,Primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) is a prototypical autoimmune disease.
10709,1153,"The involvement of B cells in the pathogenesis of pSS has long been suspected on the basis of clinical observations that include the presence of serum autoantibodies, hypergammaglobulinaemia, increased levels of free light chains and increased risk of B cell lymphoma."
10710,1153,"Moreover, the composition of the B cell subset is altered in pSS."
10711,1153,"In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms that support the increased activation of B cells in pSS, including genetic and epigenetic factors and environmental triggers that promote B cell activation via the innate immune system."
10712,1153,"B cell activating factor (BAFF, also known as TNF ligand superfamily member 13B) is at the crossroads of this process."
10713,1153,"An important role also exists for the target tissue (exocrine glands, namely the salivary and lachrymal glands), which promotes local B cell activation."
10714,1153,This continuous stimulation of B cells is the main driver of lymphomatous escape.
10715,1153,Identification of the multiple steps that support B cell activation has led to the development of promising targeted therapies that will hopefully lead to the development of an efficient therapeutic strategy for pSS.
10716,1154,PURPOSE: The purpose of this case series was to report the detection of early markers for Sjgren syndrome (SS) in 3 patients with chronic dry eye who previously tested negative for classic SS autoantibodies.
10717,1154,METHODS: Cases of 3 patients with a history of dry eye are described.
10718,1154,Current assessments in a cornea/ocular surface specialist clinical setting and an ocular medical history review are presented in conjunction with laboratory testing for the presence of novel autoantibody markers linked to the early stages of SS.
10719,1154,RESULTS: All 3 dry eye patients described in this case series tested negative for the classic autoantibody markers [Sjgren syndrome type A (SS-A) and Sjgren syndrome type B (SS-B)].
10720,1154,"However, autoantibodies were detected in these patients indicating a likely diagnosis of early-stage SS."
10721,1154,All patients were referred to a rheumatologist for further evaluation and treatment.
10722,1154,"CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of dry eye signs/symptoms that persist despite treatment (male and female patients) may benefit from a serological evaluation for SS that is capable of detecting not only the traditional SS-A and SS-B markers, but also the recently identified autoantibodies."
10723,1155,INTRODUCTION: A growing interest has arisen in salivary proteomics as a tool for the identification of biomarkers for primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
10724,1155,"Nonetheless, only a limited number of preclinical validation studies have been performed, limiting the possibility of translating proteomic results into clinical practice."
10725,1155,The primary aim of this study was to refine the diagnostic power of a panel of candidate salivary biomarkers described in pSS with respect to both healthy volunteers and pathological controls.
10726,1155,We also explored the pathogenetic function of the detected putative biomarkers both in the local exocrinopathy and in the systemic inflammatory processes of SS.
10727,1155,METHODS: One hundred and eighty patients were included in the study overall.
10728,1155,"In the first ""exploratory phase"", we enrolled 40 females with pSS, 40 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers, 10 patients with sicca non-SS and 15 secondary SS (sSS) patients."
10729,1155,"The testing cohort of the second ""challenge phase"" of the study was represented by 75 unselected, consecutive subjects: 19 pSS, 21 healthy volunteers, 10 sicca non-SS and 25 sSS patients."
10730,1155,Salivary proteomic analysis was performed combining two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS).
10731,1155,Western blot (WB) analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were employed to validate 2DE results.
10732,1155,Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Knowledge base was adopted to associate candidate biomarkers in a signalling pathogenetic network.
10733,1155,"RESULTS: A total of 28, 6, 7 and 12 protein spots were found to be significantly different in pSS samples with respect to healthy volunteers, non-SS sicca syndrome, SSc-sSS and rheumatoid arthritis-sSS, leading to the identification of 15 differently expressed proteins."
10734,1155,"Among them, -amylases precursor, carbonic anhydrase VI, -2 microglobulin, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), epidermal fatty acid binding protein (E-FABP) and immunoglobulin k light chain (IGK-light chain) apparently showed the most significant differences in pSS when compared to healthy volunteers and non-SS pathological controls."
10735,1155,"On the other hand, as expected, pSS and sSS salivary profiles shared a great number of similarities."
10736,1155,"CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that salivary fluid might represent a novel ideal milieu for the detection of a diagnostic panel of candidate biomarkers for pSS, and to gain an insight into the pathogenetic processes underlying glandular and systemic autoimmune disorders."
10737,1156,OBJECTIVES: To identify the causes and risk factors for hospitalisation in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
10738,1156,"METHODS: We included 170 pSS patients who regularly attended our Institution (2000-2013) and retrospectively collected demographic, clinical (glandular and extraglandular features) and serological (anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, RF, low C3 or C4 and immunoglobulin levels) data."
10739,1156,"If they were hospitalised, a rheumatologist determined the primary cause."
10740,1156,"We registered the length of hospitalisation, need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, number of hospitalisations and death."
10741,1156,The Disease Damage Index (SSDDI) (excluding the oral and ocular items) and the Charlson comorbidity Index were assessed.
10742,1156,We used a logistic regression analysis and multiple imputation method for missing data.
10743,1156,"RESULTS: Fifty-five (32%) patients were hospitalised, representing 111 hospitalisations (28 patients had 1 hospital admission)."
10744,1156,The hospitalisation incidence density rate was 6.49/100 patient / years.
10745,1156,"The median length of hospital stay was 9 days (IQR 6-15), there were 7 ICU admissions and 6 deaths."
10746,1156,The main causes of admissions were disease activity (33.3%) and infection (32.4%).
10747,1156,"At the multivariate analysis, the variables associated with hospitalisation were hepatic involvement (OR=5.4; 95% CI 1.61-18.15; p=0.006), vasculitis (OR=3.8; 95% CI 1.11-13.09; p=0.03), the SSDDI (OR=1.3; 95% CI 1.01-1.66; p=0.03) and the use of antimalarials (OR=0.08; 95% CI 0.02-0.22; p<0.001)."
10748,1156,CONCLUSIONS: The major causes for hospitalisation were disease activity and infection.
10749,1156,"Patients with hepatic involvement, vasculitis and more damage accrual had the highest risk for being hospitalised, while the use of antimalarials was protective."
10750,1157,In the practice of oral surgery correspondence with the pathologist is required in order to identify the lesions in question by histologic examination.
10751,1157,By current legal regulations the histological evaluation of removed tissues is mandatory.
10752,1157,In the presentation the authors process the data obtained in their Department since 2008.
10753,1157,Coincidence of the clinical and histological diagnosis is analysed statistically such is the occurrence of various types of oral mucosa lesions and cysts.
10754,1157,In cases of presumed malignancy the biopsies were carried out in a department with adequate oncological background.
10755,1157,In indications of autoimmun deseases mainly in cases of Sjgren's syndrome the Department has been requested to carry out minor salivary gland biopsies.
10756,1157,Statistical analysis of the findings of the minor salivary gland biopsies will also be discussed.
10757,1157,"The histological diagnoses have been provided by Prof. Zsuzsanna Suba MD, DMD, PhD of the Semmelweis University, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Oral Pathology Unit."
10758,1157,"In order of prevalence the most common histologically verified lesions were: radicular cyst, fibromas and granulation tissue."
10759,1157,In 84.5% of the cases the histological findings confirmed the clinical diagnoses.
10760,1157,"In 44,5% of the cases Sjgren's syndrome was verified by the minor salivary gland biopsy."
10761,1157,"Although in most cases the histological examination supported the clinical diagnoses, close cooperation of the oral surgeon and pathologist is essential."
10762,1158,We report a unique case of periocular nonnecrobiotic necrobiotic xanthogranuloma in a 52-year-old white woman with Sjgren syndrome who was subsequently found to have an immunoglobulin G paraproteinemia and coexisting small lymphocytic lymphoma.
10763,1158,"Therapy with fludarabine, cytoxan, and rituximab (FCR) resulted in a dramatic resolution of her sicca symptoms and periocular xanthogranulomas."
10764,1158,This case further illustrates the association of hematolymphoid disorders with cutaneous xanthogranulomatous disease and the importance of additional appropriate laboratory and radiologic investigation for the accurate diagnosis of an underlying malignancy.
10765,1159,BACKGROUND: Activated T and B cells participate in the development and progression of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
10766,1159,"Metformin, a first-line anti-diabetic drug, exerts anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects by activating AMPK."
10767,1159,"We investigated the therapeutic effect of metformin in non-obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ mice, an animal model of SS."
10768,1159,METHODS: Metformin or vehicle was administered orally to the mice for 9weeks.
10769,1159,"The salivary flow rate was measured at 11, 13, 15, 17, and 20weeks."
10770,1159,Histological analysis of the salivary glands from vehicle- and metformin-treated mice was conducted.
10771,1159,CD4(+) T and B cell differentiation in the peripheral blood and/or spleen was determined by flow cytometry.
10772,1159,"Serum total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay."
10773,1159,RESULTS: Metformin reduced salivary gland inflammation and restored the salivary flow rate.
10774,1159,"Moreover, metformin reduced the interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-, IL-17 mRNA, and protein levels in the salivary glands."
10775,1159,Metformin reduced the Th17 and Th1 cell populations and increased the regulatory T cell population in the peripheral blood and spleen and modulated the balance between Tfh and follicular regulatory T cells.
10776,1159,"In addition, metformin reduced B cell differentiation into germinal center B cells, decreased the serum immunoglobulin G level, and maintained the balance between IL-10- and IL-17-producing B cells."
10777,1159,"CONCLUSION: Metformin suppresses effector T cells, induces regulatory T cells, and regulates B cell differentiation in an animal model of SS."
10778,1159,"In addition, metformin ameliorates salivary gland inflammation and hypofunction, suggesting that it has potential for the treatment of SS."
10779,1160,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disorder affecting exocrine glands and characterized in most cases by a rather mild clinical picture.
10780,1160,"However, a subgroup of pSS patients experience systemic extraglandular involvement leading to a worsening of disease prognosis."
10781,1160,"Current therapeutic options for the treatment of pSS are mainly empirical, often translated by other autoimmune diseases, and recent systematic reviews have highlighted the lack of evidence-based recommendations for most of the drugs commonly employed in the spectrum of extraglandular involvement."
10782,1160,"Because of the well-established role of B-lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of pSS, a B-cell targeting therapy may represent a new and intriguing therapeutic approach; in this context, growing evidence suggests that B-cell depletion by rituximab (RTX) is also effective in pSS."
10783,1160,"Of interest, besides clinical efficacy, RTX also showed biologic effects, consistently affecting the inflammation and the lymphoid organization that occur in target tissue."
10784,1160,"Moreover, the good results observed in the published trials after RTX treatment in pSS should represent the starting point to develop evidence-based guidelines for the use of biologic therapy in this disease."
10785,1161,The objective of the study is to prospectively evaluate the spectrum of clinical and subclinical renal involvement in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS).
10786,1161,"Of the 174 patients screened, seventy patients with pSS underwent renal function tests, urine examination, renal ultrasound, arterial blood gases, urine pH followed by urine acidification test and renal biopsy (if indicated)."
10787,1161,Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) was treated with alkali replacement and moderate-severe tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) was treated with oral prednisolone.
10788,1161,Sixty-two patients completed 1-year follow-up.
10789,1161,A comparison was made between patients with and without renal involvement.
10790,1161,Thirty-five (50%) patients had renal involvement.
10791,1161,"They had a lower baseline eGFR (71.8518.04 vs. 83.817, p=0.005)."
10792,1161,Twenty-nine patients had RTA (25 complete and 4 incomplete).
10793,1161,Eleven patients had urinary abnormalities.
10794,1161,"Patients with RTA (n=29) were younger (34.99 vs. 4211.3, p=0.006), had fewer articular (34% vs. 78%, p=0.001) and ocular sicca (62% vs. 88%, P=0.01) than those without RTA (n=41) and commonly presented with hypokalemic paralysis."
10795,1161,"On biopsy, TIN (9/17) and IgA nephropathy (3/17) were most common."
10796,1161,"On follow-up, there was no clinically significant change in eGFR; however, one patient with renal calculi and incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) progressed to complete dRTA."
10797,1161,Two patients treated with steroids had marginal improvement in eGFR.
10798,1161,Renal involvement in pSS is under-recognized with the most common manifestation being RTA presenting with hypokalemic paralysis.
10799,1161,These patients are younger with less articular and sicca symptoms.
10800,1161,Subclinical RTA may progress to complete RTA.
10801,1161,Renal biopsy should be considered in all patients with renal involvement.
10802,1162,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess intraobserver and interobserver reliability of minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) in SS.
10803,1162,METHODS: All MSGBs available from the Tolerance and Efficacy of Rituximab in Primary Sjgren's Syndrome (TEARS) study were subjected to a standardized blinded assessment by a single specifically trained pathologist twice at a 2 month interval; both the Chisholm-Mason (CM) grade and the focus score (FS) were determined.
10804,1162,Baseline histopathological reports by local pathologists at each study centre were compared with the first standardized blinded assessment.
10805,1162,"Agreement was assessed for the dichotomized FS (dFS) and dichotomized CM (dCM) grade, as well as for nine other histopathological features."
10806,1162,RESULTS: Eighty-nine MSGBs were studied.
10807,1162,"Intraobserver  values were 1 for dFS, 0.80 for dCM, 0.67 for germinal centre-like structures, 0.44 for fibrosis and 0.29 for confluent foci."
10808,1162,"Most of the local histopathological reports based their diagnosis on the CM grade, although the FS was often reported or the data needed to determine it were provided."
10809,1162,"Interobserver agreement  values were 0.71 for dFS, 0.64 for dCM, 0.46 for focal lymphocytic sialadenitis, 0.42 for non-specific chronic inflammation and 0.16 for fibrosis."
10810,1162,"CONCLUSION: Although FS reliability was good, disparities were noted in the assessment methods used by local pathologists."
10811,1162,"The protocol for FS determination was not followed routinely, with the result that the FS was often overestimated."
10812,1162,"Germinal centre-like structures, which predict lymphoma, showed good reliability but were inconsistently reported."
10813,1163,"Several studies have shown a negative association between smoking and primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), and smoking may interfere with the immune response."
10814,1163,The purpose of this study was to investigate if smoking affects disease activity and disease phenotype in pSS.
10815,1163,"In this cross-sectional study, consecutive pSS patients filled out the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) form and a structured questionnaire regarding smoking habits."
10816,1163,EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) scores were calculated and blood samples were analysed for type I interferon signature using RT-PCR.
10817,1163,"Of 90 patients (93% women, median age 66.5years), 72% were type I IFN signature positive and 6, 42 and 53% were current, former and never smokers, respectively."
10818,1163,"No significant differences by smoking status were found regarding ESSDAI total score, activity in the ESSDAI domains or type I IFN signature."
10819,1163,Patients with a higher cumulative cigarette consumption ( median) had higher scores in ESSPRI total [5.0 (3.0-6.3) vs 8.0 (6.0-8.3); p<0.01] and ESSPRI sicca and pain domains.
10820,1163,"Comparing type I IFN signature negative and positive patients, the latter had significantly lower activity in ESSDAI articular domain (7/25 vs 3/64; p<0.01) and lower scores in ESSPRI total [7.7 (5.2-8.2) vs 6.0 (4.0-7.7); p=0.04]."
10821,1163,Smoking was not associated with disease phenotype although patients with a higher cumulative cigarette consumption had worse symptoms in some disease domains.
10822,1163,Current smokers were few making it difficult to draw any firm conclusions about associations to current smoking.
10823,1164,OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the presence of minor salivary gland (SG) fibrosis in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) as a function of disease pathology or a consequence of ageing.
10824,1164,METHODS: Subjects with sicca symptoms attending a Sjgren's research clinic were classified by American European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria as either pSS or non-SS (nSS).
10825,1164,"Discovery (n=34 pSS, n=28 nSS) and replication (n=35 pSS, n=31 nSS) datasets were evaluated."
10826,1164,"Minor SG cross-sections from haematoxylin and eosin stained slides were imaged, digitally reconstructed and analysed for percent area fibrosis."
10827,1164,"Relationships between SG fibrosis, age, and clinical measures were evaluated using Spearman correlations."
10828,1164,"Association with SS was assessed by: ROC curve, Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF) and uni- and bi-variate regression analyses."
10829,1164,"RESULTS: SS subjects had significantly more fibrotic tissue in their minor labial salivary glands (median 24.39%, range 5.12-51.67%) than nSS participants (median 16.7%, range 5.97-38.65%, p<0.0001); age did not differ between groups (average  SD pSS 50.2 13.9 years, nSS 53.812.4 years)."
10830,1164,"In both the discovery and replication data sets, multiple regression models showed that the area of minor salivary gland fibrosis predicted pSS significantly better than age alone."
10831,1164,Age-corrected linear regression revealed that the area of minor salivary gland fibrosis positively associated with vanBijsterveld score (p=0.042) and biopsy focus score (p=0.002).
10832,1164,ROC curve and VSURF analyses ranked fibrosis as a significantly more important variable for subject discrimination than age.
10833,1164,CONCLUSIONS: SG fibrosis is an element of pSS pathology that is related to focus score and is not solely attributable to age.
10834,1165,Radioactive iodine ((131)I) is used effectively for the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancers.
10835,1165,"Because it is actively secreted by the salivary glands, radiation damage to these glands can occur."
10836,1165,Obstructive swellings after mealtime salivary stimulation are common occurrences.
10837,1165,Dry mouth is not usually seen if low doses of (131)I are used.
10838,1165,A subjective complaint of xerostomia in a patient treated with (131)I 75.8mCi proved to be related to the simultaneous presence of Sjgren syndrome (SS).
10839,1165,"Serologic, histologic, scintigraphic, and salivary volume findings and the patient's subjective complaints served to establish the pre-existence of SS."
10840,1166,"PURPOSE: To determine whether levels of endogenous tear protein, lacritin, are linked to altered corneal innervation and dry eye severity in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
10841,1166,METHODS: Clinical data were obtained from 10 SS and 10 age-matched controls.
10842,1166,Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to assess total tear lacritin extracted from Schirmer strips.
10843,1166,"Western blot was used to detect active lacritin monomer (25 kDa), active lacritin fragment (12-15 kDa), and inactive tissue transglutaminase-generated lacritin (40 kDa)."
10844,1166,In vivo confocal microscopy was used to assess nerve fiber density (NFD) and length (NFL).
10845,1166,Relationships between nerve morphology and tear lacritin were examined by Spearman correlation.
10846,1166,Diagnostic performance of tear lacritin was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic.
10847,1166,"RESULTS: Active tear lacritin was significantly reduced in SS patients (3.72  5.62 [SS] versus 18.17  4.57 ng/100 ng total tear protein [controls]; P < 0.001), while inactive lacritin was increased (84.99%  11.15% [SS] versus 51.04%  12.03% [controls]; P < 0.001)."
10848,1166,Nerve fiber density (21.70  18.93 vs. 31.80  9.35; P = 0.03) and NFL (4.18  3.44 vs. 6.54  2.47; P < 0.05) were significantly decreased in SS patients compared to controls.
10849,1166,"Reduced NFL (r = 0.74, P < 0.01) and NFD (r = 0.70, P < 0.01) were highly correlated with reduced tear lacritin."
10850,1166,"Similarly, total tear lacritin was highly correlated with Schirmers (r = 0.77, P < 0.01), ocular staining (r = -0.80, P < 0.01), and corneal sensitivity (r = 0.81, P < 0.01)."
10851,1166,"Tear lacritin showed equivalent or better diagnostic performance compared to traditional clinical measures for SS (100.00% sensitivity, 85.71% specificity, cutoff = 14.50 ng/100 ng tear protein)."
10852,1166,"CONCLUSIONS: Reduced tear lacritin levels in SS patients are highly correlated with clinical signs of dry eye, as well as decreased NFD and NFL."
10853,1166,Lacritin and its components provide excellent diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in SS.
10854,1167,"PURPOSE: To evaluate tear osmolarity with the recently introduced TearLab system (TearLab Corporation, San Diego, CA) in patients with non-Sjgren syndrome dry eye (NSSDE) and Sjgren syndrome dry eye (SSDE), and in healthy subjects, and to compare the results with those from classical dry eye tests."
10855,1167,"METHODS: Thirty-nine eyes of 21 patients with NSSDE, 39 eyes of 20 patients with SSDE, and 44 eyes of 22 healthy individuals were included in the study."
10856,1167,"Tear osmolarity was measured with the TearLab system, lid-parallel conjunctival folds score was examined with the slit lamp, and then the classical diagnostic tests such as Schirmer I test, tear film break-up time, and corneal staining were carried out, followed by the examination of meibomian glands and corneal transparency."
10857,1167,"RESULTS: Mean tear osmolarity was 296.77  16.48 mOsm/L in NSSDE (15% abnormal), 303.36  17.22 mOsm/L in SSDE (23% abnormal), and 303.52  12.92 mOsm/L in the control group (16% abnormal; P = 0.018, Kruskal-Wallis)."
10858,1167,"Schirmer test, corneal staining, tear film break-up time, and meibomian gland status were significantly different in the 2 patient groups when compared with those in the control group (P < 0.0001)."
10859,1167,"In the control and SSDE groups, no significant correlation was disclosed between tear osmolarity and any of the dry eye tests performed."
10860,1167,CONCLUSIONS: Tear hyperosmolarity is considered a key factor that leads to dry eye symptoms and to the progression of clinical signs.
10861,1167,Osmolarity measurements with the TearLab system disclosed no ability to distinguish between healthy individuals and patients with dry eye.
10862,1167,This suggests that the TearLab device should not be used alone but in combination with classical dry eye tests.
10863,1168,This article provides a broad overview of the complex intersection between the connective tissue diseases (CTDs) and their pulmonary manifestations.
10864,1168,"Indirect pulmonary complications - such as respiratory infection and medication-induced lung toxicity - are briefly discussed, and the importance of a comprehensive assessment of the patient with CTD with respiratory symptoms is emphasized."
10865,1168,"A concise review of the many pulmonary manifestations of each specific CTD is provided, and particular emphasis is placed on CTD-associated interstitial lung disease."
10866,1169,"Perniosis are inflammatory cutaneous lesions, located on acral skin, which present in association with cold exposure."
10867,1169,They can appear as an idiopathic dermatosis or with an underlying autoimmune disease.
10868,1169,The use of cutaneous biopsy to distinguish between both types is controversial.
10869,1169,We analyze the histological findings in 9 cases of idiopathic perniosis (IP) and compare them with those obtained from 11 cases of perniosis associated with an autoimmune disease (autoimmune perniosis).
10870,1169,"The most frequent histopathological features observed in cases of IP were a lymphocytic infiltrate with perivascular (8 cases, 89%) and perieccrine distribution (6 cases, 66%), dermal edema (5 cases, 55%), and necrotic keratinocytes (5 cases, 55%), whereas those found in perniosis associated with an autoimmune disease were lymphocytic infiltrate with perivascular distribution (11 cases, 100%) but without perieccrine distribution (3 cases, 27%), vacuolation of the basal layer (7 cases, 63%), and necrotic keratinocytes (5 cases, 45%)."
10871,1169,"The only significant difference between both groups was the perieccrine distribution of the lymphocytic infiltrate in cases of IP, which, as mentioned in previous studies, could be considered a histopathological clue to differentiate both types of perniosis."
10872,1170,"OBJECTIVES: Serum immunoglobulin free light chains (FLCs) are frequently elevated in B-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, including primary SS (pSS)."
10873,1170,"The objective of this study was to assess if serum FLCs can contribute to classification, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma detection, monitoring of disease activity and treatment response in pSS."
10874,1170,METHODS: Serum samples of 100 consecutive patients suspected of pSS were included.
10875,1170,Forty-five patients fulfilled ACR-EULAR criteria for pSS.
10876,1170,"Additionally, samples of 17 pSS patients with MALT lymphoma and longitudinal samples of pSS patients treated with rituximab (n = 20), placebo (n = 10) or abatacept (n = 15) were included."
10877,1170,Serum FLC/FLC was measured by nephelometry or turbidimetry.
10878,1170,"RESULTS: At diagnosis, FLC and FLC serum levels were significantly higher in pSS compared with non-SS sicca patients."
10879,1170,The FLC/FLC ratio was abnormal in 11% of pSS patients.
10880,1170,"In established MALT-pSS patients, without recent rituximab treatment (n = 12), 50% had abnormal FLC/FLC ratios."
10881,1170,"FLC measurement had no additional value for pSS classification, compared with IgG and anti-SSA."
10882,1170,"FLC levels correlated significantly with systemic disease activity, assessed by EULAR SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) and clinical ESSDAI, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally following treatment."
10883,1170,Treatment with rituximab or abatacept significantly lowered FLC levels.
10884,1170,FLCs show a large sensitivity to change and relative changes induced by treatment were higher compared with IgG.
10885,1170,"CONCLUSION: Serum FLCs are elevated in pSS, and abnormal FLC/FLC ratios may be indicative for the presence of MALT lymhoma."
10886,1170,FLC levels can be used as a biomarker for systemic disease activity and monitoring treatment responses.
10887,1170,FLCs are sensitive to change and have more favorable kinetics than IgG.
10888,1171,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) have an increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), particularly parotid gland mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas."
10889,1171,Presence of germinal centres (GCs) in labial gland biopsies has been suggested as predictive factor for NHL.
10890,1171,"We assessed whether presence of GCs is increased in labial gland biopsies from patients with pSS who developed parotid MALT lymphoma, the dominant NHL-subtype in pSS, compared with patients with pSS who did not develop lymphoma."
10891,1171,METHODS: Eleven labial gland biopsies from patients with pSS that were taken prior to parotid MALT lymphoma development were compared with biopsies of 22 matched pSS controls (1:2) who did not develop lymphoma.
10892,1171,Biopsies were evaluated for GCs (H&E and Bcl6).
10893,1171,"RESULTS: Labial gland biopsies of pSS MALT lymphoma patients, revealed GCs in 2/11 (18%) H&E sections and 3/11 (27%) Bcl6 stained sections."
10894,1171,"In controls, GCs were present in 4/22 (18%) of H&E sections and 5/22 (23%) of Bcl6 stained sections."
10895,1171,CONCLUSION: Presence of GCs in labial gland biopsies does not differ between patients with pSS that develop parotid MALT lymphoma and patients with pSS who do not develop lymphoma.
10896,1171,The presence of GCs in labial gland biopsies is therefore not a predictive factor for pSS-associated parotid MALT lymphomas.
10897,1172,"The interferon (IFN) signature, namely the overexpression of IFN-inducible genes is a crucial aspect in the pathogenesis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
10898,1172,"The IFN-inducible IFI16 protein, normally expressed in cell nuclei, may be overexpressed, mislocalized in the cytoplasm and secreted in the extracellular milieu in several autoimmune disorders including pSS."
10899,1172,This leads to tolerance breaking to this self-protein and development of anti-IFI16 antibodies.
10900,1172,The aim of this study was to identify pathogenic and clinical significance of IFI16 and anti-IFI16 autoantibodies in pSS.
10901,1172,IFI16 and anti-IFI16 were assessed in the serum of 30 pSS patients and one-hundred healthy donors (HD) by ELISA.
10902,1172,IFI16 was also evaluated in 5 minor salivary glands (MSGs) of pSS patients and 5 MSGs of non-pSS patients with sicca symptoms by immunohistochemistry.
10903,1172,Normal MSGs do not constitutively express IFI16.
10904,1172,"Conversely, in pSS-MSGs a marked expression and cytoplasmic mislocalization of IFI16 by epithelial cells was observed with infiltrations in lymphocytes and peri/ intra-lesional endothelium."
10905,1172,pSS patients display higher serum levels of both IFI16 and anti-IFI16 autoantibodies compared to HD.
10906,1172,Our data suggest that IFI16 protein may be involved in the initiation and perpetuation of glandular inflammation occurring in pSS.
10907,1173,"OBJECTIVES: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, mainly affecting women during the fourth decade of life."
10908,1173,"During pregnancy, the presence of anti-Ro/SSa and anti-La/SSb antibodies increases the risk of congenital heart block (CHB)."
10909,1173,Foetal and pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with pSS compared with the general population are difficult to evaluate because of confounding factors including age and body mass index (BMI).
10910,1173,METHOD: The aim of this case-control study was to analyse the impact of pSS in pregnant women on foetal and pregnancy outcomes.
10911,1173,RESULTS: We enrolled 19 women with pSS (54 pregnancies) matched by age and BMI to 216 controls.
10912,1173,Patients with pSS delivered significantly earlier (38 weeks+3 days vs. 39weeks+2days) and experienced more spontaneous abortions [< 22weeks of gestation (WG)] than the controls [n=16/54 (30.0%) vs. n=1/216 (0.4%); p<0.00001].
10913,1173,"Preterm delivery ( 37(+6) WG) was significantly higher in the pSS group than in the control group (29% vs. 12%, p=0.04)."
10914,1173,"pSS activity significantly affected the birthweight percentile, which was lower in pregnancies occurring after the diagnosis of pSS than in those occurring before (32.4321.57 vs. 60.4627.37; p=0.008)."
10915,1173,No case of CHB was observed.
10916,1173,CONCLUSIONS: pSS is responsible for an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.
10917,1173,"The duration of pregnancy is lower in patients with than without pSS, with more premature deliveries."
10918,1173,Pregnancies that occur after the onset of the disease result in lower birthweight percentile children than when pSS is not clinically overt.
10919,1174,Few studies are available on the risk of ischemic stroke after a diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS).
10920,1174,"This study investigated whether PSS increased the risk of ischemic stroke in a large, nationwide cohort."
10921,1174,"Data for 4,276 patients who were newly diagnosed with PSS from 2000 to 2006 and who did not have a stroke prior to diagnosis of PSS were obtained from the Registry of Catastrophic Illness in Taiwan."
10922,1174,"For each PSS patient, data for ten controls (matched by age, gender, comorbidities, and enrollment date) without systemic autoimmune disease or previous stroke were obtained from the Longitudinal Health Insurance 2000 database."
10923,1174,"All study subjects were followed up from the date of enrollment until they developed ischemic stroke, died, or until the end of 2006, whichever was earliest."
10924,1174,"To investigate if PSS was an independent factor in determining the risk of developing ischemic stroke, a Cox regression model was used with adjustment for age, gender, and comorbid disorders."
10925,1174,"Among 4,276 PSS patients and 42,760 controls, 669 subjects (51 PSS patients and 618 controls) developed ischemic stroke during the mean 3.7-year follow-up period (interquartile range 2.2-5.2years)."
10926,1174,"Patients with PSS and controls had a similar incidence of ischemic stroke occurrence (3.17/1,000 vs. 3.90/1,000 person years)."
10927,1174,"Multivariate analysis adjusted for baseline covariates indicated that PSS did not increase the risk of ischemic stroke (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.84, 95% confidence interval: 0.63-1.12, P=0.244)."
10928,1174,PSS is not associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke subsequent to diagnosis.
10929,1175,PURPOSE: To conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic value of anti-muscarinic receptor type 3 (M3R) antibodies in Sjgren syndrome (SS).
10930,1175,"METHODS: Two databases, PUBMED and the Cochrane Library, were systematically searched."
10931,1175,"Approximately 2,000 participants from several studies were included in this research."
10932,1175,STATA 11.2 software and Meta-DiSc 1.4 was used to conduct the meta-analysis.
10933,1175,RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis.
10934,1175,"The pooled DOR was 13.00 (95% CI, 6.00-26.00)."
10935,1175,"The sensitivity was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.28-0.58) and the specificity was 0.95 (95%CI, 0.91-0.97)."
10936,1175,"The LR+ and LR- were 7.90 (95% CI, 4.70-13.40), 0.61 (95% CI, 0.46-0.79), respectively."
10937,1175,"The AUC was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86-0.92)."
10938,1175,CONCLUSION: The anti-M3R antibody had high specificity but relatively low sensitivity for the diagnosis of SS.
10939,1176,OBJECTIVE: Environmental factors have been suggested in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases.
10940,1176,We here investigated whether infections increase the risk of developing primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
10941,1176,"METHODS: Patients with pSS in Sweden (n=945) and matched controls from the general population (n=9048) were included, and data extracted from the National Patient Register to identify infections occurring before pSS diagnosis during a mean observational time of 16.0years."
10942,1176,Data were analysed using conditional logistic regression models.
10943,1176,Sensitivity analyses were performed by varying exposure definition and adjusting for previous health care consumption.
10944,1176,"RESULTS: A history of infection associated with an increased risk of pSS (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.6-2.3)."
10945,1176,"Infections were more prominently associated with the development of SSA/SSB autoantibody-positive pSS (OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.0-3.5)."
10946,1176,"When stratifying the analysis by organ system infected, respiratory infections increased the risk of developing pSS, both in patients with (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.8-4.7) and without autoantibodies (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.8), whilst skin and urogenital infections only significantly associated with the development of autoantibody-positive pSS (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.8-5.5 and OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7-4.2)."
10947,1176,"Furthermore, a dose-response relationship was observed for infections and a risk to develop pSS with Ro/SSA and La/SSB antibodies."
10948,1176,Gastrointestinal infections were not significantly associated with a risk of pSS.
10949,1176,"CONCLUSIONS: Infections increase the risk of developing pSS, most prominently SSA/SSB autoantibody-positive disease, suggesting that microbial triggers of immunity may partake in the pathogenetic process of pSS."
10950,1177,Sjgren's syndrome is a common autoimmune disorder.
10951,1177,"Several genetic risk factors such as STAT-4, ILT6 and the haplotype HLA-B8/DR3 have been identified."
10952,1177,"In addition, there are environmental risk factors, possibly chronic viral infections."
10953,1177,In the pathophysiology of Sjgren's syndrome T and B cells infiltrate the salivary and lacrimal glands.
10954,1177,"As a consequence of the destruction of glandular cells by cytotoxic T cells, production of cytokines and autoantibodies inhibiting glandular function, the production of saliva and tears is decreased."
10955,1177,The feeling of dry eyes and mouth is frequently not noticed by the patients.
10956,1177,"Therefore, Sjgren's syndrome should also be considered when extraglandular manifestations such as vasculitis, polyneuropathy or arthritis occur, even when the patients do not complain of dry eyes and mouth."
10957,1177,"Establishing the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome requires verification of reduced glandular function, for example using Schirmer's test and the Saxon test."
10958,1177,The confirmation of Sjgren's syndrome as a cause of sicca syndrome is subsequently performed by the detection of autoantibodies against Ro (SS-A) and La (SS-B) and/or by a salivary gland biopsy.
10959,1178,"A 52-year-old woman with Sjgren's syndrome presented with multiple cerebral aneurysms, which resulted in recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) manifesting as severe headache."
10960,1178,Computed tomography (CT) showed SAH.
10961,1178,Cerebral angiography revealed aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery and the left middle cerebral artery.
10962,1178,The necks of the aneurysms were successfully clipped.
10963,1178,Postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged without neurological deficit.
10964,1178,"Thirteen years later, she suddenly lost consciousness and was brought to our hospital."
10965,1178,CT demonstrated recurrence of SAH.
10966,1178,Cerebral angiography revealed cerebral aneurysms of the right internal carotid artery and the right middle cerebral artery.
10967,1178,The clipped aneurysms were stable.
10968,1178,The internal carotid artery aneurysm was successfully treated with endovascular coil embolization.
10969,1178,"However, she regained no neurological function and died."
10970,1178,Patients with Sjgren's syndrome may develop cerebral aneurysm complicated with SAH.
10971,1179,"OBJECTIVE: To identify and describe voice, speech and swallowing abnormalities in patients with Sjgren's Syndrome (SS)."
10972,1179,MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional descriptive observational study.
10973,1179,Patients with SS were interviewed and physically explored.
10974,1179,"Nasolaryngeal endoscopy, video laryngeal stroboscopy, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing and computerized voice spectrographic analysis (PRAAT software) of voice and speech were also performed."
10975,1179,RESULTS: We included 31 patients (96.7% women).
10976,1179,Average time of evolution was 5 years; mean age was 48.4 years.
10977,1179,"Of these SS cases, 87% were secondary and 13% primary."
10978,1179,"Symptomatology: 70.9% dysphagia, 41.9% dysphonia, 35.4% dysglossia, 3.2% dysarthria."
10979,1179,"We found abnormalities principally in: one or more cranial nerves (V, VII, IX, X, XII) (67.7%), nasopharyngolaryngeal mucosa (77.4%), mucosal wave of vocal cords (90%), swallowing mechanism (90.3%), spectrogram of the vowels /e/ (58.06%) and /i/ (51.61%), and rhythm of the trisyllable ""pataka"" (35.48%)."
10980,1179,"CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SS have voice, speech and swallowing abnormalities, not only associated to xerosis, but perhaps also to neurological abnormalities, probably secondary to the syndrome."
10981,1180,"The authors present imaging anatomy of the parotid space and discuss non-neoplastic lesions, autoimmune disorders, cysts, neoplastic lesions, epithelial tumors, and nonepithelial lesions."
10982,1180,"They describe the diseases and their appearance on imaging, describing how the differential diagnoses appear, along with presenting examples of the images, primarily computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging."
10983,1181,The extraglandular manifestations and lymphoproliferative disorders are complications in pSS.
10984,1181,There are few serological markers that they are useful in these conditions.
10985,1181,"OBJETIVES: to evaluate the usefulness of the 2microglobulin level in patients with pSS and its relation to extra glands manifestations , lymphoproliferative disorders and the presence of Rheumatoid factor (RF), serum immunoglobulins (Igs), and C3 and C4 levels."
10986,1181,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: we retrospectively studied patients with pSS , OAD and healthy controls ."
10987,1181,"Ig G, Ig A and Ig M levels, serum complement C3 and C4 and RF were performed by immunoturbidimetry, and 2microglobulin protein by the ELISA technique in all patients."
10988,1181,"RESULTS: 19 patients with pSS (Group SSp), 28 patients with other autoimme diseases diferent from pSS (Group PAD) and 24 healthy controls (Group C).There was an signifcant increase of 2m values in Groups SS and OAD vs Group C (6.19 mg/dl vs. 2.53 mg/dl p<0.001) and (4.38 mg/dl vs. 2.53 mg/dl p<0.01)."
10989,1181,"On the other hand, mean 2m levels in Group SS were higher than in Group OAD (6.19 vs. 4.38 mg/dl p<0.01).There was not a relationship between 2m level and Ig G, A , M ,complement levels and the presence of RF."
10990,1181,CONCLUSION: 2m can discriminate patients with pSS from those with other autoimmune diseases and healthy subjects.
10991,1181,Increased 2m level in pattients with pSS could reflect hyperactivation of B cells and it could be a potential marker associated with extraglandular manifestations and cell lymphoproliferative disorders.
10992,1182,Amyloidosis is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by misfolding of extracellular proteins.
10993,1182,The two most common forms are light-chain (AL) and reactive (AA) amyloidosis.
10994,1182,"Pulmonary amyloidosis secondary to Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is rare, and there is a paucity of data on its clinical and radiological features."
10995,1182,"We describe the case of a 41-year-old woman with diffuse septal pulmonary AL (lambda) amyloidosis related to SS, in the absence of systemic amyloidosis."
10996,1182,A systematic search for pulmonary amyloidosis in SS yielded 37 cases.
10997,1182,Amyloidosis occurred almost exclusively in women (96.5%).
10998,1182,Cough and dyspnoea (56%) were the most common symptoms.
10999,1182,"The diagnosis of pulmonary amyloidosis was made subsequent to that of SS, with a median delay of 7 years."
11000,1182,"Radiologically, diffuse nodules with (45.5%) or without (33.3%) multiple cysts were the most common pattern."
11001,1182,Most cases were related to nodular AL amyloidosis (both kappa and lambda).
11002,1182,Diffuse septal AA amyloidosis has been reported in SS.
11003,1182,"The index patient is the first documented case of diffuse septal pulmonary AL amyloidosis in SS, without systemic amyloidosis."
11004,1182,Surgical lung biopsy (78%) is usually required to establish the diagnosis and rule out lymphoma.
11005,1182,There is no data to support any definitive therapeutic intervention for SS-related pulmonary amyloidosis.
11006,1182,Observation is sufficient for nodular amyloidosis.
11007,1182,Further studies are necessary to assess the efficacy of current therapies in diffuse septal amyloidosis secondary to SS.
11008,1183,"We report a 38-year-old woman diagnosed with tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) on renal biopsy, followed by being diagnosed with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
11009,1183,"Immunohistochemically, the cellular infiltrates in TIN were mainly composed of small lymphocytes and IgM-positive plasmacytoid large lymphocytes."
11010,1183,"IgM-positive plasmacytoid large lymphocytes were not identical with, but colocalized with CD3- or CD20-positive lymphocytes."
11011,1183,TIN in patients with PBC is very rare and little is known about immunohistochemical characteristics of infiltrating cells in this setting.
11012,1183,"To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating predominant infiltrating of IgM-positive plasmacytoid large lymphocytes in TIN due to PBC and SS."
11013,1184,BACKGROUND: Immunomodulating drugs are commonly used in treating patients with autoimmune diseases but with very different outcomes.
11014,1184,We aimed to investigate differences in cytokine and autoantibody levels with regard to patient characteristics in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) receiving oral steroids or antimalarial drugs (AM) after a longer period of time.
11015,1184,METHODS: Serum samples from 141 patients fulfilling the revised EU-US criteria and 99 healthy controls were analysed for 25 cytokines and 8 autoantibodies.
11016,1184,"RESULTS: AM-patients had lowered levels of IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-, though non-significantly."
11017,1184,"Use of prednisolone was associated with reduced levels of IL-15, IL-2, IL-4, IL-12p40, TNF-, MIP-1 and MIP-1 (p<0.05), and a trend towards decreased levels of IL-1RA and IL-1 was observed."
11018,1184,No associations were seen between AM and antibody levels.
11019,1184,Significantly higher protein levels of anti-Ro-52 and anti-Ro-60 were observed in the patients taking prednisolone (p<0.05).
11020,1184,"The proportion of patients positive for anti-Ro-52 and anti-La-48 did not differ significantly in the groups taking and not taking prednisolone, but a difference was seen for anti-Ro-60 (p<0.05)."
11021,1184,CONCLUSIONS: Prednisolone is a potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drug commonly used in autoimmune diseases.
11022,1184,"Our study shows that oral steroids are associated with reduced levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, but increased levels of pSS specific autoantibodies."
11023,1184,"The association between steroid use and increased antibody levels is not readily explained by known steroid effects, and should therefore be confirmed in further studies."
11024,1184,Lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines indicate a beneficial effect of oral steroids in this patient group.
11025,1185,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence and mortality rates, and their evolution over time, of physician-diagnosed primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) in residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota."
11026,1185,"PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients with a diagnosis or suspicion of SS in Olmsted County from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2015, were reviewed to identify incident cases of pSS (defined by physician diagnosis)."
11027,1185,These cases were combined with those from a 1976 through 2005 incident cohort (n=111) from the same population.
11028,1185,Incidence rates were age and sex adjusted to the 2010 US white population.
11029,1185,Survival rates were compared with the expected rates in the population of Minnesota.
11030,1185,"RESULTS: With 61 incident cases of pSS diagnosed in Olmsted County from 2006 through 2015, the total cohort included 172 patients with incident pSS from 1976 through 2015."
11031,1185,"Of the 172 patients, 151 (88%) were women and 161 (94%) were white, with a mean  SD age at diagnosis of 58.316.7 years."
11032,1185,"The average age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence for 2006 through 2015 was 5.9 per 100,000 population (95% CI, 4.4-7.4 per 100,000 population), and the overall incidence for the entire period was 5.8 per 100,000 (95% CI, 4.9-6.6 per 100,000)."
11033,1185,The incidence increased with calendar time over the 40-year period (P=.005).
11034,1185,"There was no difference in mortality in the pSS cohort compared with expected (standardized mortality ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.86-1.50)."
11035,1185,"CONCLUSION: The average annual incidence of pSS in this population-based cohort was 5.8 per 100,000, with a progressive increase over the 40 years of the study."
11036,1185,Overall survival of patients with pSS was not different from that of the general population.
11037,1186,OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of fatigue and daytime sleepiness in primary SS (pSS) and analyse predicting sleep disturbing factors and other potential determinants of fatigue and sleepiness.
11038,1186,METHOD: Seventy-two consecutive pSS patients and 59 age-matched healthy controls were compared.
11039,1186,"Assessment instruments were profile of fatigue (ProF), visual analogue scale fatigue, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, restless legs syndrome (RLS) Diagnostic Criteria and Lund University Sleep Questionnaire."
11040,1186,"In addition, markers of immune disturbance, inflammation and disease activity using the European League Against Rheumatism SS Disease Activity Index were analysed in patients."
11041,1186,"RESULTS: Fatigue, especially somatic fatigue, is the main problem for pSS patients."
11042,1186,Sleepiness is a minor problem.
11043,1186,"Patients had significantly more often anxiety, nocturia and woke up more frequently during the night than controls."
11044,1186,The factors that predicted daytime fatigue in pSS patients were anxiety and nightly awakenings due to pain.
11045,1186,Nocturia was frequent but was not associated with fatigue or sleepiness.
11046,1186,"RLS, depression and sicca symptoms contributed to fatigue in the univariate regression analysis only."
11047,1186,"CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating not only the presence of disturbed sleep, but also that nightly musculoskeletal pain and other sleep disturbing factors and anxiety significantly influence fatigue."
11048,1186,Management strategies aimed at these aspects should therefore be included in future trials for treatment of fatigue in pSS.
11049,1187,"OBJECTIVE: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), but the reported prevalence and risk vary considerably."
11050,1187,The objective of this study was to determine the risk of NHL in a well-defined population-based primary SS cohort in Norway.
11051,1187,METHODS: The authors examined all patients fulfilling the American-European Consensus Group criteria for primary SS from 2 Norwegian counties and compared the data to the Cancer Registry of Norway to identify the primary SS patients who had lymphoma.
11052,1187,"In addition, lymphoma patient files from the same period were reviewed for undiagnosed primary SS to ensure the quality of registry data."
11053,1187,"RESULTS: As of July 1, 2009, 443 living subjects with primary SS were identified in an area with 896,840 inhabitants, which is 18.6% of the total population of Norway."
11054,1187,"Seven cases of NHL (1.6%) were found during a total followup of 3,813 person-years, resulting in a standardized incidence ratio of 9.0 (95% confidence interval 7.1-26.3) for NHL in primary SS patients."
11055,1187,CONCLUSION: The risk of NHL in patients with primary SS in Norway is increased 9 times compared with the general population.
11056,1187,"This is in accordance with recent studies, and the quality and completeness of the registries and strict use of diagnostic criteria support the validity of the results."
11057,1188,"In this study, we report a new immunoassay platform based on yeast surface display technology for detection of autoantibodies involved in autoimmune diseases, e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
11058,1188,The autoantigens of Ro52/SSA epitope and SmD were chosen to be displayed on the yeast surface with their respective antibodies as the analytes.
11059,1188,"By using magnetic beads modified with protein G, yeast cells bound with specific target antibody can be captured."
11060,1188,The amount of analytes could be determined by counting the number of fluorescent yeast cells captured in a magnetic field.
11061,1188,The platform showed promising results in the detection of SLE autoantibodies with high sensitivity and multiplex detection capability over the traditional approaches.
11062,1189,Systemic connective tissue disorders are characterized by the presence of autoantibodies and multiorgan system involvement.
11063,1189,"Juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus with or without associated antiphospholipid syndrome; juvenile dermatomyositis; sclerodermiform syndromes, including systemic and localized sclerodermas and eosinophilic fasciitis; mixed connective tissue disease; and Sjgren syndrome are the disorders that affect children most frequently."
11064,1189,"Diagnosis is difficult, because the clinical presentation of patients is diverse, from mild to severe disease."
11065,1189,"In addition, all organs may be affected."
11066,1189,"However, a variety of imaging techniques are now available to investigate rheumatic disease in children."
11067,1189,These imaging modalities offer the potential for earlier diagnosis and improved assessment of therapeutic response.
11068,1189,"This article reviews the main connective tissue disorders that affect children, highlighting their key imaging features on images acquired with different diagnostic imaging modalities and correlating these features with clinical and pathologic findings, when available."

11070,1190,OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of B cell depletion therapy on effector CD4+ T cell homeostasis and its relation to objective measures of disease activity in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS).
11071,1190,METHODS: Twenty-four patients with pSS treated with rituximab (RTX) and 24 healthy controls (HC) were included.
11072,1190,"Frequencies of circulating effector CD4+ T cell subsets were examined by flow cytometry at baseline and 16, 24, 36, and 48 weeks after the first RTX infusion."
11073,1190,"Th1, Th2, follicular Th (TFH), and Th17 cells were discerned based on surface marker expression patterns."
11074,1190,"Additionally, intracellular cytokine staining was performed for interferon-, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-21, and IL-17 and serum levels of these cytokines were analyzed."
11075,1190,"RESULTS: In patients with pSS, frequencies of circulating TFH cells and Th17 cells were increased at baseline compared with HC, whereas frequencies of Th1 and Th2 cells were unchanged."
11076,1190,"B cell depletion therapy resulted in a pronounced decrease in circulating TFH cells, whereas Th17 cells were only slightly lowered."
11077,1190,Frequencies of IL-21-producing and IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells and serum levels of IL-21 and IL-17 were also reduced.
11078,1190,"Importantly, the decrease in circulating TFH cells was associated with lower systemic disease activity over time, as measured by the European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index scores and serum IgG levels."
11079,1190,CONCLUSION: B cell depletion therapy in patients with pSS results in normalization of the elevated levels of circulating TFH cells.
11080,1190,This reduction is associated with improved objective clinical disease activity measures.
11081,1190,Our observations illustrate the pivotal role of the crosstalk between B cells and TFH cells in the pathogenesis of pSS.
11082,1191,"BACKGROUND: There is a long-lasting need for non-invasive, more accurate diagnostic techniques when evaluating primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients."
11083,1191,Incorporation of additional diagnostics involving screening for disease-specific biomarkers in biological fluid is a promising concept that requires further investigation.
11084,1191,In the current study we aimed to explore novel disease biomarkers in saliva and tears from pSS patients.
11085,1191,"METHODS: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed on stimulated whole saliva and tears from 27 pSS patients and 32 healthy controls, and salivary and tear proteomic biomarker profiles were generated."
11086,1191,LC-MS was also combined with size exclusion chromatography to isolate extracellular vesicles (EVs) from both fluids.
11087,1191,Nanoparticle tracking analysis was conducted on joint fractions from the saliva and tears to determine size distribution and concentration of EVs.
11088,1191,"Further EV characterisation was performed by immunoaffinity capture of CD9-positive EVs using magnetic beads, detected by flow cytometry."
11089,1191,"The LC-MS data were analysed for quantitative differences between patient and control groups using Scaffold, and the proteins were further analysed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), for gene ontology overrepresentation, and the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins for protein-protein interaction network analysis."
11090,1191,"RESULTS: Upregulation of proteins involved in innate immunity (LCN2), cell signalling (CALM) and wound repair (GRN and CALML5) were detected in saliva in pSS."
11091,1191,Saliva EVs also displayed biomarkers critical for activation of the innate immune system (SIRPA and LSP1) and adipocyte differentiation (APMAP).
11092,1191,Tear analysis indicated overexpression of proteins involved in TNF- signalling (CPNE1) and B cell survival (PRDX3).
11093,1191,"Moreover, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was upregulated in saliva and tears in pSS."
11094,1191,"Consistently, DAVID analysis demonstrated pathways of the adaptive immune response in saliva, of cellular component assembly for saliva EVs, and of metabolism and protein folding in tears in pSS patients."
11095,1191,"CONCLUSIONS: LC-MS of saliva and tears from pSS patients, solely and in combination with size-exclusion chromatography allowed screening for possible novel biomarkers encompassing both salivary and lacrimal disease target organs."
11096,1191,"This approach could provide additional diagnostic accuracy in pSS, and could possibly also be applied for staging and monitoring the disease."
11097,1192,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in improving physical function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with active primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), as well as the duration and sources of HRQoL improvements."
11098,1192,METHODS: Sixteen patients with pSS received rituximab infusions (375 mg/m2) at weeks 0 and 1 and were followed up for 36 weeks.
11099,1192,"All patients fulfilled 2002 American-European Consensus Group criteria for pSS and had active disease defined as scores >50 mm on two of four 100-mm visual analogue scales (VAS) evaluating global disease activity, fatigue, pain, and dryness."
11100,1192,Standardised evaluations including the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) were conducted.
11101,1192,"SF-36 score changes from baseline to weeks 12, 24, and 36 were assessed."
11102,1192,"RESULTS: Baseline mean SF-36 scores were considerably decreased, compared to the general same-age population."
11103,1192,"Role-physical (14.1  27.4), role-emotional (12.5  29.9), vitality (26.2  14.3), and general health (32.6  11.2) were the dimensions with the worst scores."
11104,1192,"Twelve weeks after rituximab, the mental component summary score was improved in 15 patients (mean improvement, 31.2  36.4, p=0.001) and the physical component summary score in 14 patients (mean improvement, 16.9  26.2, p=0.049)."
11105,1192,"Further improvements occurred from week 12 to week 24, and most of the gains were sustained at week 36."
11106,1192,Improvements in the physical and mental component summary scores failed to correlate with improvements in the VAS scores.
11107,1192,CONCLUSIONS: Substantial alterations in HRQoL were noted in patients with pSS.
11108,1192,Rituximab infusions without corticosteroid therapy produced meaningful improvements in HRQoL.
11109,1192,Controlled studies of rituximab are needed.
11110,1193,Diffuse cystic lung disease (DCLD) is a group of heterogeneous diseases that present as diffuse cystic changes in the lung on computed tomography of the chest.
11111,1193,"Most DCLD diseases are rare, although they might resemble common diseases such as emphysema and bronchiectasis."
11112,1193,"Main causes of DCLD include lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Birt-Hogg-Dub syndrome, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, amyloidosis, light-chain deposition disease, Sjgren syndrome, and primary or metastatic neoplasm."
11113,1193,"We discuss clinical factors that are helpful in the differential diagnosis of DCLDsuch as sex and age, symptoms and signs, extrapulmonary presentations, cigarette smoking, and family history."
11114,1193,"Investigations for DCLD include high-resolution computed tomography, biochemical and histopathological studies, genetic tests, pulmonary function tests, and bronchoscopic and video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsies."
11115,1193,A proposed diagnostic algorithm would enhance ease of diagnosing most cases of DCLD.
11116,1194,OBJECTIVES: Patients with primary SS (pSS) are frequently suffering from multiple enduring disorders that raise the risk of work disability and require treatment by various health-care specialists.
11117,1194,We aimed at determining predictors of physician visits and work disability in pSS patients.
11118,1194,"METHODS: Physician visits within the past 6 months, employment status and sick leave were compared among 176 female pSS patients and 115 age-matched controls."
11119,1194,"Dryness, pain, fatigue and depression were assessed by rating scales of the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), the Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort (PROFAD) and Patient Health Questionnaire depression measurements (PHQ-9)."
11120,1194,Factors associated with an increased number of physician visits and inability to work were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis.
11121,1194,"RESULTS: Patients and controls were comparable in age and education, but differed significantly in the prevalence of depression (38.1 vs 7.9%, P<0.001), the number of physician visits [17.0 (10.0) vs 6.5 (4.5); P<0.001] and gainful employment (64 years: 52.8 vs 77.1% P<0.001)."
11122,1194,"Multivariate regression analyses revealed that depression (PHQ-9) and/or fatigue, particularly lack of stamina, but not dryness, were significantly associated with physician visits and working status in pSS patients."
11123,1194,"Patients with high ratings for the statement 'I have had difficulties to keep going, was easily worn out or lacking in energy' had a highly increased risk of not being gainfully employed (adjusted OR 4.1; 95% CI 1.5, 11.2; P<0.001)."
11124,1194,"CONCLUSION: In pSS, lack of stamina and/or depression cause a higher level of individual and societal burden than dry eyes and mouth."
11125,1194,Fatigue and depression deserve more recognition as treatment targets in pSS.
11126,1195,OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the sensitivity to change of the European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) with that of other primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) disease activity indexes.
11127,1195,"METHODS: We abstracted 96 patient profiles, including data on 3 successive visits (visits 1-3), from the medical charts of patients with primary SS."
11128,1195,"Patient profiles were scored with the ESSDAI, SS Disease Activity Index (SSDAI), and Sjgren's Systemic Clinical Activity Index (SCAI)."
11129,1195,"Thirty-nine experts assessed 5 profiles for whether disease activity had improved, worsened, or remained stable at visits 2 and 3."
11130,1195,"RESULTS: For improved patients, the standardized response means (SRMs) for all scores did not differ, and ranged from -1.08 to -1.38 between visits 1 and 2 and from -0.50 to -0.76 between visits 2 and 3."
11131,1195,"For patients with worsened activity, the SRMs between visits 1 and 2 and between visits 2 and 3 were +0.46 and +1.10 for the ESSDAI, -0.03 and +0.79 for the SSDAI, and +0.17 and +1.02 for the SCAI, respectively."
11132,1195,"For patients with stable activity, the SRMs between visits 1 and 2 and between visits 2 and 3 were 0.00 and -0.13 for the ESSDAI, -0.44 and -0.11 for the SSDAI, and -0.36 and +0.34 for the SCAI, respectively."
11133,1195,"CONCLUSION: For patients with improved activity, the 3 disease activity indexes showed similar, large sensitivity to change."
11134,1195,"However, the ESSDAI seemed to detect changes in activity more accurately than other disease activity indexes."
11135,1195,"Notably, for patients with stable activity, the ESSDAI did not show erroneous improvement."
11136,1196,Inflammatory optic neuritis (ON) represents a frequent clinical situation in neurology and ophthalmology.
11137,1196,"The most current etiology is multiple sclerosis (MS) but, when MRI and Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses are normal, ON is usually considered as ""idiopathic"" with a suspected viral etiology."
11138,1196,"In rare cases, a systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, lupus or Sjgren syndrome may be diagnosed."
11139,1196,In several cases either a recurrence or a myelitis may occur without any argument for MS.
11140,1196,"In the first case, it corresponds to relapsing inflammatory optic neuritis (RION) and in the second case to neuromyelitis optica (NMO)."
11141,1196,"In the present paper, the author successively presents the various clinical situations and complementary findings (infectious, vasculitis, NMO or idiopathic) that can lead to a differential diagnosis of MS in a context of ON."
11142,1197,Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are increasingly recognized in patients with systemic diseases.
11143,1197,Patients with early ILD changes may be asymptomatic.
11144,1197,Features of ILD overlap among systemic diseases and with idiopathic variety.
11145,1197,High-resolution computed tomography plays a central role in diagnosing ILDs.
11146,1197,Imaging features are often nonspecific.
11147,1197,Therapy- and complication-related lung changes would pose difficulty in diagnosing and classifying an ILD.
11148,1197,Biology and prognosis of secondary ILDs may differ between different disease-related ILDs and idiopathic variety.
11149,1197,"Combination of clinical features, serological tests, pulmonary and extrapulmonary imaging findings, and pathology findings may help to diagnose ILDs."
11150,1198,"OBJECTIVE: The Brief Cognitive Symptoms Inventory (BCSI) is a short, self-report scale designed to measure cognitive symptomatology in patients with rheumatic disease."
11151,1198,"To facilitate research and clinical practice, we tested the internal consistency and validity of the BCSI in patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS)."
11152,1198,METHODS: Patients who met the American-European Consensus Group criteria for SS and healthy controls completed a questionnaire assessing symptoms including cognitive complaints.
11153,1198,"We calculated Cronbach's alpha to assess internal consistency and Pearson correlation coefficients to test for association between BCSI, symptoms, and demographic variables."
11154,1198,Total score distribution was analyzed to establish cutoff criteria for differentiation of case versus non-case.
11155,1198,We compared neuropsychological outcomes of patients with SS above and below the threshold BCSI score to assess the association of cognitive symptoms with objective cognitive deficits.
11156,1198,RESULTS: Complete data were available on 144 patients with SS and 35 controls.
11157,1198,Internal consistency of the BCSI was good.
11158,1198,Scores were similar in all patient groups and patients reported more cognitive symptoms than controls (p < 0.0001).
11159,1198,"BCSI scores correlated moderately with pain, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and health quality."
11160,1198,High scores for cognitive dysfunction were reported by 20% of the patients with SS and only 3% of controls.
11161,1198,"Patients with cognitive scores > 50 had more depression, fatigue, pain (effect size all > 1), and worse performance on multiple cognitive domains."
11162,1198,CONCLUSION: The BCSI should be a useful tool for the study of cognitive symptoms in SS.
11163,1198,Both self-report and standardized tests should be considered in screening for cognitive disorders in SS.
11164,1199,OBJECTIVE: Alterations in the microbiota composition of the gastro-intestinal tract are suspected to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of two closely related systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases: primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
11165,1199,Our objective was to assess whether alterations in gut and oral microbiota compositions are specific for pSS and SLE.
11166,1199,"METHODS: 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on fecal samples from 39 pSS patients, 30 SLE patients and 965 individuals from the general population, as well as on buccal swab and oral washing samples from the same pSS and SLE patients."
11167,1199,"Alpha-diversity, beta-diversity and relative abundance of individual bacteria were used as outcome measures."
11168,1199,"Multivariate analyses were performed to test associations between individual bacteria and disease phenotype, taking age, sex, body-mass index, proton-pump inhibitor use and sequencing-depth into account as possible confounding factors."
11169,1199,"RESULTS: Fecal microbiota composition from pSS and SLE patients differed significantly from population controls, but not between pSS and SLE."
11170,1199,"pSS and SLE patients were characterized by lower bacterial richness, lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and higher relative abundance of Bacteroides species in fecal samples compared with population controls."
11171,1199,"Oral microbiota composition differed significantly between pSS patients and SLE patients, which could partially be explained by oral dryness in pSS patients."
11172,1199,"CONCLUSIONS: pSS and SLE patients share similar alterations in gut microbiota composition, distinguishing patients from individuals in the general population, while oral microbiota composition shows disease-specific differences between pSS and SLE patients."
11173,1200,"BACKGROUND: The potential efficacy of immunosuppressive (IS) treatment has been reported in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with connective tissue disease (CTD), but its positioning in the treatment algorithm remains uncertain."
11174,1200,"The aim of this study was to identify predictors of favorable responses to first-line IS treatment.MethodsandResults:This single-center retrospective study included 30 patients with PAH accompanied by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed CTD (MCTD), or primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) who received first-line IS treatment alone or in combination with pulmonary vasodilators."
11175,1200,"When short-term treatment response was defined as an improvement in World Health Organization functional class at 3 months, 16 patients (53%) were short-term responders."
11176,1200,"Simultaneous diagnosis of PAH and CTD, and the use of immunosuppressants, especially intravenous cyclophosphamide, in addition to glucocorticoids were identified as independent predictors of a short-term response (P=0.004 and 0.0002, respectively)."
11177,1200,"Cumulative rates free of PAH-related death were better in short-term responders than non-responders (P=0.04), and were best in patients with a simultaneous diagnosis of PAH and CTD who were treated initially with a combination of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants."
11178,1200,"CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a simultaneous diagnosis of PAH and CTD, including SLE, MCTD, and primary SS, should receive intensive IS treatment regimens to achieve better short- and long-term outcomes."
11179,1201,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR-) on non-obese diabetic mice (NOD mice) with Sjogren's syndrome.
11180,1201,METHODS: 22 eight-week-old female NOD mice were randomly divided into 2 groups.
11181,1201,Rosiglitazone and normal saline were administered in the PPAR- group and the control group respectively.
11182,1201,"At the age of 9, 12 and 15 weeks, one mouse in each group was sacrificed respectively, and the remaining mice were sacrificed at the age of 18 weeks."
11183,1201,"Blood were obtained by cardiac puncture, and salivary glands were resected."
11184,1201,The degree of salivary gland damage and infiltration of lymphocytes were examined by H&E staining.
11185,1201,"The level of IL-1, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF- in serum were measured by ELISA."
11186,1201,"The mRNA expression level of IL-1, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF- in MSG were detected by Real-time PCR."
11187,1201,Expression of PPAR- in the salivary glands was detected by Immunohistochemistry.
11188,1201,"RESULTS: Compared with the control group, mice in the PPAR- group showed that (1) histopathologic changes in the salivary glands were significantly ameliorated; (2) at the age of 18 weeks, IL-6 [(25.86  7.32) vs (37.41  11.34)] and TNF- [(56.88  22.19) vs (78.61  20.76)] were expressed significantly lower and IL-4 [(25.76  12.65) vs (12.11  3.70)] was expressed significantly higher in serum (P < 0.05); (3) the expression of TNF- was significantly decreased and the expression of IL-4 was significantly increased in MSG (P < 0.05)."
11189,1201,CONCLUSION: PPAR- ameliorates Sjogren's syndrome on NOD mice effectively.
11190,1201,The mechanism may be related to the reduction of Th1 cytokines and change of T helper cell balance from Th1 to Th2.
11191,1202,INTRODUCTION: Gougerot-Sjgren syndrome (GSS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of saliva and lachrymal glands.
11192,1202,About 20% of patients develop a neurological involvement.
11193,1202,CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old woman was admitted with a dysautonomic and sensorial neuropathy.
11194,1202,"Clinical manifestations (dry syndrome and positive Schirmer's test), blood (anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies) and histological (chronic sialadenitis) tests linked this neuropathy to a primary GSS."
11195,1202,"The characteristics of this case were acute onset (within a few days), severe clinical presentation (continued confinement to bed and malnutrition) and non-responsiveness to all treatments (intravenous immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, rituximab)."
11196,1202,CONCLUSION: This case illustrates various clinical signs and inconstant responsiveness to treatment of neuropathy associated with primary GSS.
11197,1203,"OBJECTIVE: For the definitive diagnosis of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), biopsies of local lesions are recommended so as to exclude other diseases, including lymphoma and cancer."
11198,1203,"However, performing biopsies of underlying organs is technically difficult."
11199,1203,"In this study, we examined the diagnostic utility of labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsy as a less invasive procedure."
11200,1203,METHODS: Sixty-six patients with suspected IgG4-RD by clinical findings or high serum IgG4 underwent LSG biopsy.
11201,1203,We examined the relationship between the number of IgG4-positive plasma cells in LSG and clinical findings.
11202,1203,"RESULTS: The final diagnosis was 45 patients with IgG4-RD, 12 with Sjgren's syndrome, four with suspected Sjgren's syndrome, three with malignant lymphoma, one with systemic lupus erythematosus, and one with Warthin's tumor."
11203,1203,"The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of LSG biopsy were 55.6%, 100.0%, and 70.0%, respectively."
11204,1203,Forty-five IgG4-RD patients were divided into two groups: 1) 25 with lesions of salivary glands (IgG4-RD S+) and 2) 20 without these lesions (IgG4-RD S-).
11205,1203,Seventeen of 25 (68.0%) IgG4-RD S+and 8 of 20 (40.0%) IgG4-RD S-patients were positive for LSG biopsy.
11206,1203,"In the IgG4-RD S-patients, the mean number of affected organs and serum IgG4 in the positive cases for LSG biopsy were significantly higher than in the negative cases."
11207,1203,CONCLUSION: A solo LSG biopsy is insufficient for the diagnosis of IgG4-RD because of its low sensitivity.
11208,1203,"However, LSG biopsy combined with clinical findings, including serum IgG4 and number of affected organs, may contribute towards a diagnosis of IgG4-RD patients with affected underlying organs."
11209,1204,The objective of this prospective cross-sectional case-control study was to examine the prevalence of dryness symptoms and its impact on quality of life (QoL) among very long-term survivors after hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) in comparison with their respective sibling donors.
11210,1204,Forty-four allogeneic HSCT recipients with a long-term survival (median: 17.5; range: 11-26 years) were included.
11211,1204,"Their respective, HLA-identical sibling donors served as controls."
11212,1204,Clinical examinations included saliva flow rates (SFR) and the Schirmer's test.
11213,1204,"The presence of sicca symptoms of mouth, eyes and skin were inquired."
11214,1204,The social functioning (SF)-36 questionnaire was applied.
11215,1204,Recipients had lower (P<0.01) unstimulated and stimulated mean SFR than donors.
11216,1204,Schirmer's test results <5 mm was found in 45% of the recipients in comparison with 27% of the donors (P = 0.07).
11217,1204,"Xerostomia (34 vs 4 subjects), xerophtalmia (23 vs 3) and dry skin (32 vs 12) were reported more often by the recipients than donors (P<0.001)."
11218,1204,Sicca symptoms and their objective findings correlated with QoL.
11219,1204,The mean SF-36 scores of the donors were significantly higher than those of the recipients for physical component summary.
11220,1204,"In conclusion, sicca symptoms are common amongst long-term survivors of HSCT and affect remarkably the QoL."
11221,1205,"The frequent association of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) with non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma (NHL) provides an example of the interplay of systemic autoimmunity and lymphoproliferative diseases, and an opportunity to study the pathogenetic steps of lymphomagenesis."
11222,1205,NHL develops in approximately 5% of SS patients.
11223,1205,"Parotidomegaly, lymphadenopathy, inflammatory neuropathy and vasculitis have been found to be predictive of the development of lymphoma."
11224,1205,A subsequent NHL is also heralded by the appearance of cryoglobulinaemia and serum or urinary monoclonal proteins.
11225,1205,The typical histological type of NHL in SS is a low-grade extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma.
11226,1205,The authors discuss the proposed key immunopathologic steps of lymphomagenesis in SS in detail.
11227,1205,"Recent results indicating the pathogenetic role of ectopic germinal centre formation in the involved exocrine glands, the potential importance of an antigen-driven clonal proliferation of autoreactive B-lymphocytes, the proposed role of the B-lymphocyte activating factor (BAFF) and of further cytokines and, finally, the changes of the chemokine milieu at the site of lymphoma development are highlighted."
11228,1206,OBJECTIVES: The overexpression of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) may decrease the efficacy of rituximab treatment in Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
11229,1206,"Anti-CD20 therapy was effective on marginal zone B cells, in the murine model for human CD20 expression only when preceded by anti-BAFF therapy."
11230,1206,The possible efficacy of a sequential anti-BAFF/anti-CD20 therapy in SS was investigated.
11231,1206,"METHODS: We treated with belimumab, a monoclonal anti-BAFF antibody, and soon after with rituximab a patient with severe, refractory SS, parotid low-grade B-cell MALT lymphoma and cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis."
11232,1206,"Previous treatments with rituximab and with rituximab plus high dose glucocorticoids, as well as with cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, plasma exchange, hyperbaric therapy, VAC therapy, prostacyclin, mycophenolate mofetil and surgery, had previously failed."
11233,1206,"Treatment with belimumab was then given, but it also failed."
11234,1206,A new course of rituximab (375 mg/m2; four weekly infusions) was started 49 days after the last infusion of belimumab.
11235,1206,"RESULTS: This sequential belimumab-rituximab treatment was followed by a marked amelioration, with the complete and persistent regression of lymphoma and healing of a refractory skin ulcer."
11236,1206,A full cycle of rituximab was then repeated 6 and 12 months later; no further treatment was given in the following 22 months up to now.
11237,1206,Serum cryoglobulins and rheumatoid factor became persistently negative and serum BAFF and C4 persistently normal.
11238,1206,"No relevant side effects were noticed, except for a marked decrease in serum IgM."
11239,1206,The follow up after belimumab-rituximab sequential therapy is now three and a half years.
11240,1206,CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with belimumab followed by rituximab may be effective for SS-related B-cell lymphoproliferation.
11241,1206,The efficacy and safety of the sequential or concomitant targeting of BAFF and CD20 deserves further evaluation in SS.
11242,1207,"Despite recent advances in the understanding of Sjgren's Syndrome (SjS), the pathogenic mechanisms remain elusive and an ideal model for early drug discovery is not yet available."
11243,1207,"To establish a humanized mouse model of SjS, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy volunteers or patients with SjS were transferred into immunodeficient NOD-scid IL-2r(null) mouse recipients to produce chimeric mice."
11244,1207,"While no difference was observed in the distribution of cells, chimeric mice transferred with PBMCs from SjS patients produced enhanced cytokine levels, most significantly IFN- and IL-10."
11245,1207,"Histological examination revealed enhanced inflammatory responses in the lacrimal and salivary glands of SjS chimeras, as measured by digital image analysis and blinded histopathological scoring."
11246,1207,"Infiltrates were primarily CD4+, with minimal detection of CD8+ T-cells and B-cells."
11247,1207,These results demonstrate a novel chimeric mouse model of human SjS that provides a unique in vivo environment to test experimental therapeutics and investigate T-cell disease pathology.
11248,1208,"OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and safety of B cell depletion with rituximab, a chimeric murine/human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial."
11249,1208,"METHODS: Patients with active primary SS, as determined by the revised American-European Consensus Group criteria, and a rate of stimulated whole saliva secretion of > or =0.15 ml/minute were treated with either rituximab (1,000 mg) or placebo infusions on days 1 and 15."
11250,1208,Patients were assigned randomly to a treatment group in a ratio of 2:1 (rituximab:placebo).
11251,1208,"Followup was conducted at 5, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks."
11252,1208,"The primary end point was the stimulated whole saliva flow rate, while secondary end points included functional, laboratory, and subjective variables."
11253,1208,RESULTS: Thirty patients with primary SS (29 female) were randomly allocated to a treatment group.
11254,1208,"The mean +/- SD age of the patients receiving rituximab was 43 +/- 11 years and the disease duration was 63 +/- 50 months, while patients in the placebo group were age 43 +/- 17 years and had a disease duration of 67 +/- 63 months."
11255,1208,"In the rituximab group, significant improvements, in terms of the mean change from baseline compared with that in the placebo group, were found for the primary end point of the stimulated whole saliva flow rate (P = 0.038 versus placebo) and also for various laboratory parameters (B cell and rheumatoid factor [RF] levels), subjective parameters (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory [MFI] scores and visual analog scale [VAS] scores for sicca symptoms), and extraglandular manifestations."
11256,1208,"Moreover, in comparison with baseline values, rituximab treatment significantly improved the stimulated whole saliva flow rate (P = 0.004) and several other variables (e.g., B cell and RF levels, unstimulated whole saliva flow rate, lacrimal gland function on the lissamine green test, MFI scores, Short Form 36 health survey scores, and VAS scores for sicca symptoms)."
11257,1208,One patient in the rituximab group developed mild serum sickness-like disease.
11258,1208,CONCLUSION: These results indicate that rituximab is an effective and safe treatment strategy for patients with primary SS.
11259,1209,"Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the systemic exocrine glands, such as salivary and lacrimal glands."
11260,1209,A variety of T-cell subpopulations maintain immune tolerance in the thymus and periphery through complex immune responses including cellular and humoral immunity.
11261,1209,The T-cell subpopulations exhibiting abnormal or unique phenotypes and impaired functionality have been reported to play important roles in the cellular mechanisms of autoimmunity in SS patients and animal models of SS.
11262,1209,"In this review, we focused on follicular helper T cells related to antibody production and regulatory T cells to control immune tolerance in the pathogenesis of SS."
11263,1209,The unique roles of these T-cell subpopulations in the process of the onset or development of SS have been demonstrated in this review of recent publications.
11264,1209,The clinical application of these T-cell subpopulations will be helpful for the development of new techniques for diagnosis or treatment of SS in the future.
11265,1210,"INTRODUCTION: Interleukin (IL)-21 is a cytokine that controls the functional activity of effector T helper cells and the differentiation of Th17 cells, and promotes B-cell differentiation."
11266,1210,"To test whether IL-21 participates in the pathogenesis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS), serum IL-21 level was measured and IL-21 expression in the labial salivary glands (LSG) was examined."
11267,1210,"METHODS: Serum IL-21 levels in 40 primary SS, 40 rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 38 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and 20 healthy controls were measured."
11268,1210,"Serum IL-21 levels of SS patients were assessed for correlations with laboratory data, including anti-nuclear antibody, anti-Ro/La antibodies, globulin, immunoglobulin (Ig) class, and IgG subclass."
11269,1210,LSGs from 16 primary SS and 4 controls with sicca symptoms were evaluated for IL-21 and IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) expression by immunohistochemistry.
11270,1210,Confocal microscopy was performed to further characterize the IL-21 positive cells.
11271,1210,"RESULTS: Primary SS patients had significantly higher serum IL-21 levels than controls, and these increments correlated positively with levels of IgG, IgG1."
11272,1210,Serum IgG1 levels correlated with anti-Ro antibody titers.
11273,1210,"Immunohistochemical analyses showed that lymphocytic foci and the periductal area of the LSGs from SS patients expressed high levels of IL-21 and lower levels of IL-21R, whereas the control LSGs showed minimal expression of both antigens."
11274,1210,"The more the lymphocyte infiltrated, IL-21 expression in LSGs showed a tendency to increase."
11275,1210,Confocal microscopic analyses revealed that IL-21 expressing infiltrating lymphocytes in the LSGs of SS patients also expressed CXCR5.
11276,1210,"CONCLUSIONS: Primary SS is associated with high serum IL-21 levels that correlate positively with serum IgG, especially IgG1, levels."
11277,1210,The expression of IL-21 is increased as more lymphocytes infiltrated in LSGs.
11278,1210,These observations suggest that IL-21 may play an important role in primary SS pathogenesis.
11279,1211,OBJECTIVE: Classification criteria for systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) are being updated jointly by the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism.
11280,1211,Potential items for classification were reduced to 23 using Delphi and nominal group techniques.
11281,1211,"We evaluated the face, discriminant, and construct validity of the items to be further studied as potential criteria."
11282,1211,"METHODS: Face validity was evaluated using the frequency of items in patients sampled from the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group, 1000 Faces of Lupus, and the Pittsburgh, Toronto, Madrid, and Berlin connective tissue disease (CTD) databases."
11283,1211,"Patients with SSc (n = 783) were compared to 1,071 patients with diseases similar to SSc (mimickers): systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 499), myositis (n = 171), Sjgren's syndrome (n = 95), Raynaud's phenomenon (RP; n = 228), mixed CTD (n = 29), and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; n = 49)."
11284,1211,Discriminant validity was evaluated using odds ratios (ORs).
11285,1211,"For construct validity, empirical ranking was compared to expert ranking."
11286,1211,"RESULTS: Compared to mimickers, patients with SSc were more likely to have skin thickening (OR 427); telangiectasias (OR 91); anti-RNA polymerase III antibody (OR 75); puffy fingers (OR 35); finger flexion contractures (OR 29); tendon/bursal friction rubs (OR 27); anti-topoisomerase I antibody (OR 25); RP (OR 24); fingertip ulcers/pitting scars (OR 19); anticentromere antibody (OR 14); abnormal nailfold capillaries (OR 10); gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms (OR 8); antinuclear antibody, calcinosis, dysphagia, and esophageal dilation (all OR 6); interstitial lung disease/pulmonary fibrosis (OR 5); and anti-PM-Scl antibody (OR 2)."
11287,1211,"Reduced carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, PAH, and reduced forced vital capacity had ORs of <2."
11288,1211,Renal crisis and digital pulp loss/acroosteolysis did not occur in SSc mimickers (OR not estimated).
11289,1211,"Empirical and expert ranking were correlated (Spearman's  = 0.53, P = 0.01)."
11290,1211,"CONCLUSION: The candidate items have good face, discriminant, and construct validity."
11291,1211,Further item reduction will be evaluated in prospective SSc and mimicker cases.
11292,1212,OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms that are also found in other conditions.
11293,1212,This study aimed to evaluate manifestations at disease onset and to compare early SLE manifestations to those of diseases mimicking SLE.
11294,1212,"METHODS: Academic lupus centers in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America collected baseline data on patients who were referred to them during the previous 3 years for possible SLE and who had a symptom duration of <1 year."
11295,1212,Clinical and serologic manifestations were compared between patients diagnosed as having SLE and those diagnosed as having SLE-mimicking conditions.
11296,1212,Diagnostic performance of the 1997 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) SLE classification criteria and the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) SLE classification criteria was tested.
11297,1212,RESULTS: Data were collected on 389 patients with early SLE and 227 patients with SLE-mimicking conditions.
11298,1212,"Unexplained fever was more common in early SLE than in SLE-mimicking conditions (34.5% versus 13.7%, respectively; P < 0.001)."
11299,1212,"Features less common in early SLE included Raynaud's phenomenon (22.1% versus 48.5%; P < 0.001), sicca symptoms (4.4% versus 34.4%; P < 0.001), dysphagia (0.3% versus 6.2%; P < 0.001), and fatigue (28.3% versus 37.0%; P = 0.024)."
11300,1212,"Anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-(2) -glycoprotein I antibodies, positive Coombs' test results, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hypocomplementemia, and leukopenia were more common in early SLE than in SLE-mimicking conditions."
11301,1212,Symptoms detailed in the ACR and SLICC classification criteria were significantly more frequent among those with early SLE.
11302,1212,"Fewer patients with early SLE were not identified as having early SLE with use of the SLICC criteria compared to the ACR criteria (16.5% versus 33.9%), but the ACR criteria demonstrated higher specificity than the SLICC criteria (91.6% versus 82.4%)."
11303,1212,"CONCLUSION: In this multicenter cohort, clinical manifestations that could help to distinguish early SLE from SLE-mimicking conditions were identified."
11304,1212,These findings may aid in earlier SLE diagnosis and provide information for ongoing initiatives to revise SLE classification criteria.
11305,1213,The heightened risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) development in primary Sjogren syndrome (SS) is well established.
11306,1213,Several adverse clinical and laboratory predictors have been described.
11307,1213,"In the current work, we aimed to formulate a predictive score for NHL development, based on clinical, serological, and histopathological findings at the time of SS diagnosis."
11308,1213,"In the present case-control study of 381 primary SS patients and 92 primary SS patients with concomitant NHL, clinical, serological, and histopathological variables at the time of SS diagnosis were retrospectively recorded."
11309,1213,For the identification of predictors for NHL development univariate and multivariate models were constructed.
11310,1213,"Salivary gland enlargement (SGE), lymphadenopathy, Raynaud phenomenon, anti-Ro/SSA or/and anti-La/SSB autoantibodies, rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity, monoclonal gammopathy, and C4 hypocomplementemia were shown to be independent predictors for NHL development."
11311,1213,"On the basis of the number of independent risk factors identified, a predictive risk score for NHL development was formulated."
11312,1213,"Thus, patients presenting with 2 risk factors had a 3.8% probability of NHL development, those with 3 to 6 risk factors 39.9% (OR (95%CI): 16.6 [6.5-42.5], P<0.05), while in the presence of all 7 risk factors the corresponding probability reached 100% (OR [95%CI]: 210.0 [10.0-4412.9], P<0.0001)."
11313,1213,"In conclusion, an easy to use diagnostic scoring tool for NHL development in the context of SS is presented."
11314,1213,This model is highly significant for the design of early therapeutic interventions in high risk SS patients for NHL development.
11315,1214,AIMS: The objective of this study was to perform the Portuguese transcultural adaptation of the original Brazilian version of the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) while evaluating the association between hyposalivation and quality of life in a Sjgrens Syndrome population.
11316,1214,METHODS: The original Brazilian version of the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 was culturally adapted following the guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation of health-related quality of life measures.
11317,1214,The questionnaires were administered by trained and calibrated dental doctors to 86 patients with Sjgrens Syndrome.
11318,1214,"Oral Health Impact Profile-14 properties were examined including reliability, internal consistency and test-retest reliability, using Cronbach's alpha, total and inter-item correlation, and intra-class correlation coefficients, respectively."
11319,1214,Whole saliva secretion rates and hyposalivation-related variables were collected and statistically analyzed.
11320,1214,Spearmans rho correlations were obtained between salivary flows and OHIP -14 domains and total score.
11321,1214,Alpha was set at 0.05.
11322,1214,Informed consents and local ethical committee clearance were obtained.
11323,1214,RESULTS: Each question of the questionnaire performed adequately.
11324,1214,Cronbach alpha values for the 14 questions were 0.89 for both test administrations and were lower if item removed.
11325,1214,Scores for both questionnaire administration and ICC results presented good to excellent reliability with ICC ranging from 84% to 92%.
11326,1214,"Mean salivary flow rate was 0.05 (SD: 0.03) ml/min and mean stimulated salivary flow was 0.57 (SD: 0.44) ml/min, which are within expected values in a population with hyposalivation."
11327,1214,"The results describe a negative and significant correlation between total OHIP-14-PT score, physical pain, physical disability domain and stimulated and differential salivary flows."
11328,1214,There was a negative and significant correlation between unstimulated salivary flow with physical pain.
11329,1214,"CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, the OHIP-14-PT seems to be a valid and reliable instrument for measuring oral health related quality of life in patients with Sjgrens Syndrome."
11330,1214,Both differential and stimulated salivary flows seem to correlate negatively with age and the quality of life is significantly diminished by lower stimulated salivary flow rates.
11331,1215,"Shrinking lung syndrome (SLS) is an uncommon feature of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) characterized by dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, diaphragmatic elevation, restrictive ventilatory defect and reduced respiratory muscle strength as measured by volitional tests."
11332,1215,We report the case of a 28-year-old woman with overlapping features of SLE and Sjgren syndrome who developed severe SLS while receiving corticosteroids and azathioprine for severe polyarthritis.
11333,1215,"She was treated with a combination of rituximab and cyclophosphamide, which led to a dramatic improvement in her clinical condition and respiratory function tests."
11334,1215,The increase in vital capacity was one of the highest among 35 published cases of SLS.
11335,1215,"Thus, restoring a near-normal lung function is an achievable goal in SLS, and the use of rituximab, with or without concomitant cyclophosphamide, certainly deserves further study in this setting."
11336,1216,"To determine whether omega-3 (n-3) increases saliva production in patients with Sjgren's syndrome, 61 patients with Sjgren's received either wheat germ oil (n = 23) or n-3 supplement (TheraTears Nutrition) (n = 38) in a prospective, randomized, double-masked trial."
11337,1216,The outcomes assessed were salivary secretion and markers for oral inflammation.
11338,1216,"The differences between the n-3 group and wheat germ oil group were not statistically significant for either unstimulated (US) or stimulated (SS) salivary secretion (p= 0.38 and p= 0.346, respectively) nor for the number of sites with probing depth (PD)  4 mm (p= 0.834)."
11339,1216,"In this pilot study, supplementation with n-3 was not found to be significantly better than wheat germ oil in stimulating saliva production in patients with Sjgren's syndrome."
11340,1217,"OBJECTIVE: Extant epidemiologic data of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) remains limited, particularly for racial/ethnic populations in the US."
11341,1217,"The Manhattan Lupus Surveillance Program (MLSP) is a population-based retrospective registry of cases of systemic lupus erythematosus and related diseases, including primary SS in Manhattan, New York."
11342,1217,The MLSP was used to provide estimates of the incidence and prevalence of primary SS across major racial/ethnic populations.
11343,1217,"METHODS: MLSP cases were identified from hospitals, rheumatologists, and population databases."
11344,1217,"Three case definitions were used for primary SS, including physician diagnosis, rheumatologist diagnosis, and modified primary SS criteria."
11345,1217,"Rates among Manhattan residents were age-adjusted, and capture-recapture analyses were conducted to assess underascertainment of cases."
11346,1217,"RESULTS: By physician diagnosis, age-adjusted overall incidence and prevalence rates of primary SS among adult Manhattan residents were 3.5 and 13.1 per 100,000 person-years, respectively."
11347,1217,"Capture-recapture adjustment increased incidence and prevalence rates (4.1 and 14.2 per 100,000 person-years, respectively)."
11348,1217,"Based on physician diagnosis, incidence and prevalence rates were approximately 6 times higher among women than men (P < 0.001)."
11349,1217,Incidence of primary SS was statistically higher among non-Latina Asian women (10.5) and non-Latina white women (6.2) compared with Latina women (3.2).
11350,1217,Incidence was also higher among non-Latina Asian women compared with non-Latina black women (3.3).
11351,1217,Prevalence of primary SS did not differ by race/ethnicity.
11352,1217,Similar trends were observed when more restrictive case definitions were applied.
11353,1217,CONCLUSION: Data from the MLSP revealed disparities among Manhattan residents in primary SS incidence and prevalence by sex and differences in primary SS incidence by race/ethnicity among women.
11354,1217,These data also provided epidemiologic estimates for the major racial/ethnic populations in the US.
11355,1218,"OBJECTIVES: Anti-muscarinic acetylcholine type-3 receptor (anti-M3R) autoantibodies have been suggested to be pathogenic for primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), and the second extracellular loop of M3R is suspected to carry a disease-promoting epitope."
11356,1218,"In this study, we aimed to evaluate the pathogenicity of autoantibodies against peptides derived from the second extracellular loop of M3R in mice and to determine whether those autoantibodies could be used as biomarker for pSS."
11357,1218,METHODS: BALB/c mice were immunized with modified linear or cyclic peptides of the second extracellular loop of M3R.
11358,1218,The function of exocrine glands was evaluated by measuring the secretion of saliva and tears.
11359,1218,The histological evaluations were performed by using H&E staining or direct immunofluorescence staining.
11360,1218,Autoantibodies against linear or cyclic peptides of the second extracellular loop of M3R in human and mice were determined using ELISA.
11361,1218,"RESULTS: Immunization induced mice to produce autoantibodies against the linear or cyclic peptides of the second extracellular loop of M3R, and those autoantibodies could bind onto salivary glands."
11362,1218,"However, those mice showed neither impairment in the secretion of tears or saliva nor histological abnormality in the exocrine glands."
11363,1218,"Furthermore, passive transfer of the IgG isolated from the immunized mice into healthy mice did not induced the dysfunction of the exocrine glands."
11364,1218,"The prevalence of autoantibodies against the peptides of the second extracellular loop of M3R was low in pSS patients, and it did not differ significantly from that in healthy controls."
11365,1218,CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the autoantibodies against peptides of the second extracellular loop of M3R are not pathogenic in vivo and they are not suitable as biomarkers for pSS diagnosis.
11366,1219,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is primarily defined by its impact on the oral and ocular system resulting in xerostomia and xerophthalmia.
11367,1219,"However, SS can also manifest throughout the respiratory system."
11368,1219,Subclinical pulmonary involvement is common.
11369,1219,Clinically significant involvement can result in a 4-fold increased risk of death.
11370,1219,"Thus, recognizing the many potential presentations of SS in the lung is critical in caring for patients with SS."
11371,1219,"Additionally, SS should be included in the differential diagnosis of a number of forms of interstitial lung disease."
11372,1220,Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is a pivotal regulator of inflammation and cell death.
11373,1220,An integral component of ER stress-induced apoptosis is expression of growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 (GADD153).
11374,1220,"Further, ER stress response is implicated in leukocyte adhesion and recent studies have discovered endogenous inhibitors of leukocyte adhesion including the developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1)."
11375,1220,"Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is associated with increased salivary gland expression of GADD153 and increased leukocyte infiltration in association with decreased Del-1 thereby contributing to inflammation and cell death."
11376,1220,"We utilized the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a model of SS-like disease, in association with immunostaining and flow cytometry-based studies."
11377,1220,"Salivary glands of 14-week-old NOD mice displayed a) increased GADD153 expression, b) marked reduction in Del-1, c) inflammatory cell infiltrates including CD3+ T and CD19+ B lymphocytes as well as M1 and M2 macrophages and d) increased pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-17 but reduced anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10."
11378,1220,These changes were accompanied with disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and significant increase in apoptosis and necrosis of salivary gland cells of NOD than control mice.
11379,1220,Our collective observations suggested that GADD153 directly and/or indirectly through downregulation of Del-1 contributes importantly to salivary gland inflammation and cell death.
11380,1220,"To establish the relevance of GADD153 and Del-1 for the human condition, lower lip biopsy samples of non-SS subjects and those with a diagnosis of SS were subjected to immunohistochemistry."
11381,1220,The results show intense GADD153 immunostaining but marked reduction in Del-1 expression in biopsy samples of SS compared to non-SS subjects.
11382,1220,"Collectively, the results indicate that GADD153 regulates inflammation and cell death in salivary gland in SS."
11383,1220,"Further, Del-1 expression likely provides a mechanistic link between increased GADD153 and leukocyte infiltration and accompanying inflammation of salivary gland tissue in this condition."
11384,1221,"Compared with conventional cancer therapies, the spectrum of toxicities observed with checkpoint inhibitors is unique and can affect any organ system."
11385,1221,"Arthralgia and myalgia were by far the most commonly reported rheumatic immune-related adverse events in clinical trials, and there is now a growing number of case series and reports describing clinical features of de novo rheumatic immune-related adverse events, which will be the focus of this review."
11386,1221,"Some patients develop genuine classic rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases, but a number of rheumatic immune-related adverse events mimic rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases with atypical features, mainly polymyalgia rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis and myositis, as well as several systemic conditions, including sicca syndrome, vasculitis, sarcoidosis, systemic sclerosis and lupus."
11387,1222,"Patients with rheumatic disease may present with a myriad of symptoms, from joint pain and rashes to more subtle findings, such as dry eyes and dry mouth."
11388,1222,"In this article, the authors review in detail the common presenting symptoms of rheumatic disease along with key features in the history and physical examination to help distinguish these from other disease processes."
11389,1223,Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a complex and heterogeneous disorder characterized by different clinical subsets.
11390,1223,"Recently, great efforts have been made searching for reliable biomarkers able to ameliorate the diagnostic algorithm and the prognostic stratification of pSS patients and ultimately allowing the scientific community to address some of the unmet needs for the disease."
11391,1223,"In this review, we have summarized the state of the art of 'traditional' widely acknowledged clinical, serological and histologic biomarkers for pSS with the aim of highlighting their relevance and limitations in clinical practice."
11392,1223,"We have also explored some of the novel potential biomarkers that have been proposed more recently, potentially able to open new ways in the assessment of the disease."
11393,1224,The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of Sjgren's syndrome-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SS/SLE) patients.
11394,1224,"Medical charts of 41 consecutive SS/SLE inpatients admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) from February 1998 to February 2008 were systematically reviewed, including demographic data, clinical features, laboratory findings, treatment as well as outcomes."
11395,1224,Two hundred and fourteen cases were randomly selected as controls from 2331 SLE-only inpatients treated in PUMCH at the same time period.
11396,1224,"There were significant differences between SS/SLE and SLE-only patients in the following manifestations (p < 0.05): (1) sex ratio (F/M) (41/0 versus 184/30), age (42.8 +/- 41.0 years versus 31.8 +/- 31.0 years), disease duration (113.8 +/- 84.0 months versus 44.9 +/- 18.0 months); (2) clinical features, xerostomia (85.4% versus 6.1%), xerophthalmia (75.6% versus 2.3%), renal tubular acidosis (21.9% versus 0%), interstitial lung disease (12.2% versus 2.8%), facial rash (9.8% versus 46.3%), nephrotic syndrome (7.3% versus 31.3%), central nervous system involvement (4.9% versus 19.6%); (3) laboratory findings, ESR (64.6+/-75.0mm/h versus 46.5+/-34.0mm/h), C4 (14.8 +/- 12.2 g/dl versus 12.0 +/- 10.9 g/dl), IgG elevation (56.4% versus 29.9%) and IgA elevation (38.5% versus 20.4%), RF, anti-SSA and anti-SSB positive rates (70.8% versus 20.3%, 82.9% versus 43.4% and 39.0% versus 7.9%); (4) SLEDAI score (8.0 +/- 8.0 versus 10.2 +/- 10.0), glucocorticoid treatment (methylprednisolone bolus/1-2 mg kg(-1) day(-1) prednisone/<1 mg kg(-1) day(-1) prednisone) (8/26/7 versus 91/102/21), and importantly, rate of death and/or severe irreversible organ failure (2.4% versus 14.9%)."
11397,1224,"SS/SLE patients were followed up for 33.0 +/- 34.0 months, 40 cases remained stable at a low dose of corticosteroid."
11398,1224,"In conclusion, different from SLE-only patients, SS/SLE patients have distinctive clinical manifestations and benign prognosis that require less vigorous treatment with glucocorticoids and/or immunosuppressants."
11399,1225,BACKGROUND: Sjgren's syndrome antigen B is expressed in the nucleus and surface membrane of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils and is released after cell death.
11400,1225,"However, its biological role is not clear."
11401,1225,This study is aimed to investigate the effect of Sjgren's syndrome antigen B on human polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
11402,1225,"METHODS: Human recombinant Sjgren's syndrome antigen B (rSSB) purified from E. coli was incubated with human polymorphonuclear neutrophils as well as retinoid acid-induced granulocytic differentiated HL-60 cells, HL-60 (RA)."
11403,1225,"Interleukin (IL)-8 protein production and mRNA expressions were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative-polymerase chain reaction, respectively."
11404,1225,Uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-rSSB was assessed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy.
11405,1225,"Moreover, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and nuclear factor-kappaB activation were investigated."
11406,1225,RESULTS: Human rSSB stimulated IL-8 production from normal human neutrophils and HL-60 (RA) cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
11407,1225,"This IL-8-stimulated activity was blocked by chloroquine and NH4Cl, indicating that endosomal acidification is important for this effect."
11408,1225,We found rSSB activated both MAPK pathway and nuclear factor-kappaB signaling to transcribe the IL-8 gene expression of cells.
11409,1225,"Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor- exerted an additive effect and rSSB-anti-SSB immune complex exhibited a synergistic effect on rSSB-induced IL-8 production."
11410,1225,CONCLUSIONS: Sjgren's syndrome antigen B might act as an endogenous danger molecule to enhance IL-8 gene expression in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
11411,1226,AIMS: Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is a rare life-threatening gastrointestinal complication in the course of connective tissue disease (CTD).
11412,1226,PCI is characterised by the appearance of intramural clusters of gas in the small and large bowel wall on X-ray or computed tomography and often is accompanied by free air in the peritoneal cavity.
11413,1226,METHODS: We present three cases of PCI in patients with scleroderma-related conditions.
11414,1226,"A review of the English language literature published on MEDLINE from 1973 to 2008 was conducted using the terms: 'systemic sclerosis', 'connective tissue disease' and 'pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis'."
11415,1226,"This review focused on clinical features, diagnostic and treatment strategies of PCI in the context of CTD."
11416,1226,"RESULTS: Symptoms of PCI are non-specific: abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, bloating and weight loss."
11417,1226,"Coexistence of PCI with other manifestations of CTD, such as intestinal pseudo-obstruction and/or bacterial overgrowth, complicates the clinical diagnosis."
11418,1226,"Treatment approach to PCI is mostly conservative: intestinal 'rest', parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, fluids and electrolyte supplementation, and inhaled oxygen."
11419,1226,"Surgical intervention should be performed only in cases of bowel perforation, ischaemia or necrosis."
11420,1226,Patients with PCI have high mortality rates due to PCI itself but also to the severity and variety of basic CTD complications.
11421,1226,"CONCLUSION: Recognition of PCI, particularly in the context of underlying CTD, is necessary for proper therapeutic application."
11422,1226,"In patients with underlying CTD and symptoms of abdominal emergency, recruitment of multidisciplinary teams, including rheumatologist, gastroenterologist, imaging specialist and surgeons familiar with intestinal complications of CTD-related conditions, is warranted."
11423,1227,OBJECTIVE: To address the association between a history of tuberculosis (TB) or nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection and the risk of newly diagnosed Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
11424,1227,"METHODS: Using a nationwide, population-based, claims dataset, and after excluding those who had rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, we identified 5,751 newly diagnosed SS cases during 2007-2012, and compared them to 86,265 non-SS controls matched (1:15) for age, sex, and the year of first SS diagnosis date."
11425,1227,"The association between the risk of incident SS and a history of mycobacterial infection, including TB and NTM, was quantified by calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using conditional logistic regression analysis after adjustment for Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and bronchiectasis."
11426,1227,"RESULTS: The mean age was 5514 years, and the proportion of female gender was 87.8% in both newly diagnosed SS cases andnon-SS controls."
11427,1227,"An association was observed between NTM infection (OR, 11.24; 95% CI, 2.37-53.24) and incident SS, but not between TB infection and incident SS (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.97-1.71) after adjustment for CCI and bronchiectasis."
11428,1227,"The association between NTM and SS risk was remarkably strong among those aged between 45 and 65 years (OR, 39.24; 95% CI, 3.97-387.75) and those without bronchiectasis (OR, 39.98; 95% CI, 3.83-376.92)."
11429,1227,"CONCLUSION: The study reveals a significant association of newly diagnosed SS with a history NTM infection, especially among individuals aged 40-65 years or those without bronchiectasis."
11430,1228,"Laugier-Hunziker syndrome is a rare benign idiopathic condition characterized by acquired macular pigmentation of lips and buccal mucosa, often accompanied with melanonychia."
11431,1228,"The main concern with this condition is to rule out other differential diagnosis with systemic repercussions and similar hyperpigmentation patterns, such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, adrenal insufficiency and melanoma."
11432,1228,"We report a 58-year-old female with a 20-year history of Sjgrens syndrome, presenting with melanonychia and hyperpigmentation in the buccal mucosa."
11433,1228,She had no relevant medication history and is a non-smoker.
11434,1228,The patient denied any other symptoms.
11435,1228,The histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of Laugier-Hunziker syndrome.
11436,1229,Vasoconstriction accompanied by changes in skin color is a normal physiologic response to cold.
11437,1229,The distinction between this normal physiology and Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) has yet to be well characterized.
11438,1229,"In anticipation of the 9th International Congress on Autoimmunity, a panel of 12 RP experts from 9 different institutes and four different countries were assembled for a Delphi exercise to establish new diagnostic criteria for RP."
11439,1229,Relevant investigators with highly cited manuscripts in Raynaud's-related research were identified using the Web of Science and invited to participate.
11440,1229,Surveys at each stage were administered to participants via the on-line SurveyMonkey software tool.
11441,1229,The participants evaluated the level of appropriateness of statements using a scale of 1 (extremely inappropriate) through 9 (extremely appropriate).
11442,1229,"In the second stage, panel participants were asked to rank rewritten items from the first round that were scored as ""uncertain"" for the diagnosis of RP, items with significant disagreement (Disagreement Index > 1), and new items suggested by the panel."
11443,1229,Results were analyzed using the Interpercentile Range Adjusted for Symmetry (IPRAS) method.
11444,1229,"A 3-Step Approach to diagnose RP was then developed using items the panelists ""agreed"" were ""appropriate"" diagnostic criteria."
11445,1229,"In the final stage, the panel was presented with the newly developed diagnostic criteria and asked to rate them against previous models."
11446,1229,"Following the first two iterations of the Delphi exercise, the panel of 12 experts agreed that 36 of the items were ""appropriate"", 12 items had ""uncertain"" appropriateness, and 13 items were ""inappropriate"" to use in the diagnostic criteria of RP."
11447,1229,"Using an expert committee, we developed a 3-Step Approach for the diagnosis of RP and 5 additional criteria for the diagnosis of primary RP."
11448,1229,"The committee came to an agreement that the proposed criteria were ""appropriate and accurate"" for use by physicians to diagnose patients with RP."
11449,1230,BACKGROUND: Optic neuritis (ON) is often the first symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) while there has been very little research reported on ON combined with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
11450,1230,The aim of this study is to provide different treatments and services for and NMO patients combined with SS.
11451,1230,"METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with ON combined SS were divided into two groups: corticosteroid group (C group, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, 14 patients) and corticosteroid+ immunosuppressant group (C+I group, leflunomide, 13 patients)."
11452,1230,"ON relapse times in 1 year after treatment, number of patients who relapsed to NMO/MS in 1 years, visual acuity and retina nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness were measured."
11453,1230,Mann Whitney-Wilcoxon test was used to compare continuous variables and Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was to compare proportions.
11454,1230,"RESULTS: ON combined with SS patients had higher incidence rates in middle-aged women who have binocular damage and heavier visual function damage or when there is an easy relapse, and the patients are often hormone dependent."
11455,1230,The patients are more likely anti-aquaporin-4 IgG seropositive (70.4%).
11456,1230,They are liable to form a centrocecal scotoma and tubular vision.
11457,1230,"The times of relapse decreased in patients who used immunosuppressant, and a significant difference was found between immunosuppressant and non-immunosuppressant groups in visual acuity recovery during 6-month follow-up period (P < 0.05); however, the RNFL thickness at the four quadrants was not significantly different."
11458,1230,CONCLUSIONS: The effect of immunosuppressant plus corticosteroid on the early onset of ON combined with SS was to provide ON remedy and to prevent recurrence in clinics.
11459,1230,This study provides a significant reference for the prevention and treatment of ON on the basis of immunosuppressant and corticosteroid.
11460,1231,OBJECTIVES: There are currently no head-to-head comparisons of sialagogues for Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
11461,1231,"We compared the tolerability and side effect profile of pilocarpine and cevimeline in patients with pSS and determined clinical, laboratory and pathological variables associated with therapeutic failure."
11462,1231,METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the use of pilocarpine and cevimeline in 118 patients with pSS who fulfilled the 2002 American European Consensus Group criteria in a University-based setting.
11463,1231,"Clinical, laboratory and pathological baseline variables were collected."
11464,1231,Failure of therapy was defined as the clinician or patient's decision to stop treatment either due to lack of efficacy or side effects.
11465,1231,"RESULTS: Cevimeline was associated with lower failure rates compared to pilocarpine among first-time users: 27% vs. 47% (p=0.02), and all users: 32% vs. 61% (p<0.001)."
11466,1231,Severe sweating was the most frequent side effect leading to cessation of therapy and occurred more frequently in pilocarpine (25%) than cevimeline (11%) users (p=0.02).
11467,1231,"Patients who previously failed one secretagogue were less likely to discontinue treatment with the other agent, 52% of first-time users vs. 27% of second-time users (p=0.004)."
11468,1231,Only ANA positivity was associated with failure: [59% vs. 38%] (p=0.03).
11469,1231,CONCLUSIONS: pSS patients were more likely to continue cevimeline than pilocarpine long-term due to fewer reported side effects with cevimeline.
11470,1231,Therapeutic failure of one secretagogue did not predict similar results with the other since second time users were more likely to continue long-term treatment.
11471,1232,OBJECTIVES: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease affecting the exocrine glands and internal organs including the central nervous system (CNS).
11472,1232,The fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) is a maturation factor essential for brain homeostasis.
11473,1232,Blood levels of Flt3L are increased in inflammatory diseases including the inflamed salivary glands in pSS.
11474,1232,"The present study evaluated the role of Flt3L in the CNS of patients with pSS and in two non-autoimmune conditions, fibromyalgia (FM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)."
11475,1232,"METHOD: Levels of Flt3L were measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of patients with pSS (n = 15), FM (n = 29), and AD (n = 39) and related to CNS symptoms and to markers of inflammation and degeneration."
11476,1232,"RESULTS: Levels of CSF Flt3L in pSS and AD were significantly lower than in FM (p = 0.005 and p = 0.0003, respectively)."
11477,1232,"Flt3L in pSS correlated to tau proteins [total tau (T-tau), r = 0.679; phosphorylated tau (P-tau), r = 0.646] and to a marker for microglia activation, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1)."
11478,1232,Similar correlations were present in FM and AD patients.
11479,1232,One-third of pSS patients had low levels of CSF Flt3L.
11480,1232,"This group had decreased levels of amyloid precursor protein metabolites (A40 and A42) in CSF, which was not seen in FM patients."
11481,1232,CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a strong correlation between CSF Flt3L and tau proteins in pSS patients suggesting ongoing degradation/remodelling in the CNS.
11482,1232,"In pSS patients, low levels of Flt3L were linked to changes in amyloid turnover and may represent processes similar to those in AD."
11483,1233,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of tumor like Sjgren's syndrome (TLSS) patients and non-tumor like Sjgren's syndrome (NTLSS) and the incidence of lymphoma in patients of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
11484,1233,METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out in 199 primary SS (including TLSS) patients who were recruited in Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology from 1998 to 2010.
11485,1233,Clinical and laboratory information were collected.
11486,1233,The patients were divided into two groups: TLSS (n = 25) and NTLSS (n = 174).
11487,1233,Clinical and laboratory characteristics were compared between these two groups by a statistical analysis.
11488,1233,"RESULTS: Of the 25 TLSS patients, 23 had enlargements of parotid glands and 2 had enlargements of submandibular glands."
11489,1233,"There were significant differences of salivary scintigraphy appearance (P = 0.018), hypergammaglobulinemia (P = 0.014), rheumatoid factor positive rate (P = 0.001), formation of the ectopic germinal centers (P = 0.014), double positive rate of anti-SSA antibody and anti-SSB antibody (P < 0.001) between the TLSS and NTLSS patients."
11490,1233,"Among the 25 TLSS patients, 3 developed lymphomas, accounting for 1.5% (3/199) of the total 199 patients and 12% (3/25) of the TLSS patients."
11491,1233,Lymphoma subtypes included one diffused large B-cell lymphoma and two mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.
11492,1233,There was no lymphoma detected in NTLSS patients.
11493,1233,"CONCLUSIONS: There are clinical and laboratory differences between TLSS and NTLSS patients, with a more tendency to develop lymphomas in TLSS patients."
11494,1234,AIM: To retrospectively investigate the features of renal involvements in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) with biopsy results.
11495,1234,METHODS: A total of 2096 pSS inpatients at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in China from 2005 to 2015 were identified.
11496,1234,Patients with biopsy-proven renal involvement (SS-renal) and matched controls (SS-only) were recruited.
11497,1234,The clinical and pathologic features as well as treatments and outcomes were systematically analyzed.
11498,1234,RESULTS: One hundred and three pSS nephritis (inpatients had biopsy-proven renal involvement.
11499,1234,"Tubulointerstitial 53, 51.5%) was the prominent pathologic pattern with glomerulonephritis (GN) present in 50 (48.5%) of the renal lesions."
11500,1234,"The patterns of GN lesions included membranous nephropathy (37, 35.9%), mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (six, 5.8%) or immunoglobulin A nephropathy (three, 2.9%), minimal change disease (four, 3.9%) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (three, 2.9%)."
11501,1234,"Compared to SS-only patients, SS-renal patients had fewer dry eyes and positive objective xerostomia (P < 0.05)."
11502,1234,"They presented with a significantly lower incidence of interstitial lung disease (ILD), leukocytopenia and elevated immunoglobulin G levels (P < 0.05)."
11503,1234,They received a larger initial dosage of corticosteroid and had a higher mortality rate (P < 0.05).
11504,1234,CONCLUSION: This Chinese SS-renal population with biopsy results has diverse pathologic patterns and distinct clinical features.
11505,1234,They are characterized with prominent renal-associated and mild SS-associated features.
11506,1234,They received more vigorous treatment but had poorer prognosis.
11507,1235,"Implant rehabilitation in patients with Sjogren's Syndrome is reported to offer an improvementin the quality of life, but the scientific evidence on implant survival in patients with Sjogren's Syndrome is scarce."
11508,1235,The paper presents a review of the literature on the performance of dental implants in patients with Sjogren's Syndrome and two case reports of patients with Sjogren's Syndrome treated successfully with dental implants.
11509,1235,Two female patients suffering from Sjogren's Syndrome were rehabilitated with implant-supported prostheses.
11510,1235,"After eighteen months and two years respectively, the patients were satisfied with function and aesthetics; restorations were comfortable, stable radiographic bone levels were noted and xerostomia was not reported to affect the function anymore."
11511,1236,The objective of this study was to present an immunoassay for the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome based on the autodisplayed La/SSB protein on the outer membrane of intact E. coli (strain UT-5600) and LPS-free E. coli (ClearColi).
11512,1236,"As the first step, an autodisplay vector (pCK002) was transfected into intact E. coli and LPS-free E. coli for comparison of efficiency of autdisplay of La/SSB."
11513,1236,The maximal level of La/SSB expression was estimated to be similar for LPS-free E. coli and intact E. coli at different optimal induction periods.
11514,1236,"Intact E. coli was found to grow twofold faster than LPS-free E. coli, and the maximal level of expression for LPS-free E. coli was obtained with a longer induction period."
11515,1236,"When the zeta potential was measured, both intact E. coli and LPS-free E. coli showed negative values, and the autodisplay of negatively charged La/SSB protein (pI<7) on the outer membrane of intact E. coli and LPS-free E. coli resulted in a slight change in zeta potential values."
11516,1236,E. coli with autodisplayed La/SSB protein was used for an immunoassay of anti-La/SSB antibodies for the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome.
11517,1236,The surface of E. coli with the autodisplayed antigen was modified with rabbit serum and papain to prevent false positive signals because of nonspecific binding of unrelated antibodies from human serum.
11518,1236,"LPS-free E. coli with autodisplayed La/SSB protein yielded sensitivity and selectivity of 81.6% and 78.6%, respectively."
11519,1236,The Bland-Altman test showed that the immunoassays based on LPS-free E. coli and intact E. coli with autodisplayed La/SSB protein were statistically equivalent to a clinical immunoassay for detection of anti-La/SSB antibodies (confidence coefficient 95%).
11520,1237,"OBJECTIVE: To study the safety and clinical efficacy of rituximab therapy for primary Sjgren's syndrome, as well as to investigate its mechanisms."
11521,1237,"METHODS: Patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome were enrolled in an open-label trial, were given rituximab (1 gm) infusions on days 1 and 15, and were monitored through week 52."
11522,1237,"The primary end point was safety, with secondary end points evaluating clinical and biologic efficacy."
11523,1237,"Blood was obtained for enumeration of lymphocyte subsets, measurement of serum autoantibody and BAFF levels, and analysis of gene expression."
11524,1237,RESULTS: Twelve female patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome were administered rituximab.
11525,1237,They had a median age of 51 years (range 34-69 years) and a median disease duration of 8.0 years (range 2-18 years).
11526,1237,We observed no unexpected toxicities from the rituximab therapy.
11527,1237,"Modest improvements were observed at week 26 in patient-reported symptoms of fatigue and oral dryness, with no significant improvement in the objective measures of lacrimal and salivary gland function."
11528,1237,The recovery of blood B cells following the nadir from rituximab therapy was characterized by a predominance of transitional B cells and a lack of memory B cells.
11529,1237,"While blood B cell depletion was associated with an increase in serum BAFF levels, no significant changes were observed in the levels of serum anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, and anti-type 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor autoantibodies or in the blood interferon signature."
11530,1237,"CONCLUSION: In patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome, a single treatment course of rituximab was not associated with any unexpected toxicities and led to only modest clinical benefits despite effective depletion of blood B cells."
11531,1238,Interstitial lung disease (ILD) has been reported in 3 to 11% of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
11532,1238,The aims of this retrospective multicenter study were to: 1) analyze characteristics and outcome of ILD in pSS; and 2) evaluate predictive factors associated with ILD onset and deterioration.
11533,1238,Twenty-one of 263 patients with pSS (8%) developed ILD.
11534,1238,"ILD onset preceded pSS diagnosis (n=5), was concurrently identified in association with pSS (n=6) and developed after pSS onset (n=9)."
11535,1238,"Presenting ILD manifestations were: acute/subacute (n=11) onset of ILD, symptomatic progressive onset of ILD (n=5), and asymptomatic patients exhibiting abnormalities consistent with ILD on PFTs and HRCT-scan (n=5)."
11536,1238,"ILD therapy included: steroids (n=21), cyclophosphamide (n=1), azathioprine (n=4) and rituximab (n=1)."
11537,1238,"The course of ILD was as follows: improvement (15.8%), stabilization (47.4%) or deterioration (36.8%)."
11538,1238,"Predictive parameters of ILD onset were: older age (p=0.044), Raynaud's phenomenon (p=0.001) and esophageal involvement (p=0.001)."
11539,1238,Factors associated with ILD deterioration were: older age (p=0.038) and esophageal involvement (p=0.038).
11540,1238,"Thus, this study underscores the poor outcome of ILD during pSS; thus, systematic screening of pulmonary involvement is required in pSS patients, resulting in both diagnosis and management at early stage of ILD."
11541,1238,We also suggest that patients presenting predictive factors of ILD deterioration may need a closer follow-up and a more aggressive therapy.
11542,1239,OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between labial salivary gland (LSG) histopathology and other phenotypic features of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
11543,1239,"METHODS: The database of the Sjgren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA), a registry of patients with symptoms of possible SS as well as those with obvious disease, was used for the present study."
11544,1239,LSG biopsy specimens from SICCA participants were subjected to protocol-directed histopathologic assessments.
11545,1239,"Among the 1,726 LSG specimens exhibiting any pattern of sialadenitis, we compared biopsy diagnoses against concurrent salivary, ocular, and serologic features."
11546,1239,RESULTS: LSG specimens included 61% with focal lymphocytic sialadenitis (FLS; 69% of which had focus scores of 1 per 4 mm) and 37% with nonspecific or sclerosing chronic sialadenitis (NS/SCS).
11547,1239,"Focus scores of 1 were strongly associated with serum anti-SSA/SSB positivity, rheumatoid factor, and the ocular component of SS, but not with symptoms of dry mouth or dry eyes."
11548,1239,"Those with positive anti-SSA/SSB were 9 times (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 7.4-11.9) more likely to have a focus score of 1 than were those without anti-SSA/SSB, and those with an unstimulated whole salivary flow rate of <0.1 ml/minute were 2 times (95% CI 1.7-2.8) more likely to have a focus score of 1 than were those with a higher flow rate, after controlling for other phenotypic features of SS."
11549,1239,"CONCLUSION: Distinguishing FLS from NS/SCS is essential in assessing LSG biopsies, before determining focus score."
11550,1239,"A diagnosis of FLS with a focus score of 1 per 4 mm, as compared to FLS with a focus score of <1 or NS/SCS, is strongly associated with the ocular and serologic components of SS and reflects SS autoimmunity."
11551,1240,We investigated the clinical and biological significance of germinal centers (GC) present in the minor salivary glands of patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
11552,1240,"Minor salivary gland tissue biopsies from 93 patients with SS were used to identify GC-like structures, which were confirmed by CD21-positive follicular dendritic cell networks."
11553,1240,"Patients were compared based upon sociodemographics, glandular and extraglandular manifestations, and laboratory findings including autoantibody profiles, complement, and immunoglobulin levels; EULAR SS disease activity index (ESSDAI) and SS disease damage index (SSDDI) were also measured."
11554,1240,GC-like structures were observed in 28 of 93 SS patients (30.1%).
11555,1240,Mean focus scores and CRP levels were significantly higher in GC-positive patients than in GC-negative patients; GC-positive patients also exhibit a higher prevalence of rheumatoid factor and anti-SS-A/Ro antibodies compared to GC-negative patients.
11556,1240,No differences in glandular or extra-glandular manifestations were evident between groups.
11557,1240,"In conclusion, SS patients with GC-like structures in the minor salivary glands exhibited laboratory profiles significantly different from those of their GC-negative counterparts."
11558,1240,Long-term follow-up of these patients will be necessary to determine whether these laboratory abnormalities are predictive of clinical outcomes.
11559,1241,BACKGROUND: Increased expression of B cell activating factor (BAFF or B lymphocyte stimulator) may explain the B cell activation characteristic of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
11560,1241,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of belimumab, targeting BAFF, in patients with pSS."
11561,1241,"METHODS: Patients were included in this bi-centric prospective 1-year open-label trial if they fulfilled American European Consensus group criteria, were anti-Sjgren's syndrome A-positive and had current systemic complications or salivary gland enlargement, or early disease (<5 years), or biomarkers of B cell activation."
11562,1241,"They received belimumab, 10 mg/kg, at weeks 0, 2 and 4 and then every 4 weeks to week 24."
11563,1241,"The primary end-point, assessed at week 28, was improvement in two of five items: reduction in 30% in dryness score on a visual analogue scale (VAS), 30% in fatigue VAS score, 30% in VAS pain score, 30% in systemic activity VAS assessed by the physician and/or >25% improvement in any B cell activation biomarker values."
11564,1241,"RESULTS: Among 30 patients included, the primary end-point was achieved in 18 (60%)."
11565,1241,The mean (SD) European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index decreased from 8.8 (7.4) to 6.3 (6.6) (p=0.0015) and EULAR) Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index from 6.4 (1.1) to 5.6 (2.0) (p=0.0174).
11566,1241,"The mean dryness, fatigue and pain VAS varied from 7.8 (1.8) to 6.2 (2.9) (p=0.0021), 6.9 (1.8) to 6.0 (2.2) (p=0.0606) and 4.6 (2.6) to 4.7 (2.4) (p=0.89), respectively."
11567,1241,Salivary flow and Schirmer's test did not change.
11568,1241,CONCLUSIONS: These encouraging results justify future randomised controlled trials of belimumab in a selected target population of pSS patients most likely to benefit from treatment.
11569,1242,OBJECTIVE: To study the expression levels and immunostimulatory capacities of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in primary Sjgren's syndrome.
11570,1242,"METHODS: Labial salivary gland (LSG) IL-7 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry, using a quantitative scoring system, in 30 patients with sicca syndrome: 15 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and 15 patients with non-SS sicca syndrome."
11571,1242,"The correlation of IL-7 expression in LSGs with parameters of local and peripheral disease was studied, and serum and salivary IL-7 levels were determined."
11572,1242,"Additionally, the effects of IL-7 on cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with primary SS were determined in vitro by Luminex multicytokine assay and compared with the effects in control subjects."
11573,1242,RESULTS: The expression of IL-7 in LSGs was higher in patients with primary SS compared with that in patients with non-SS sicca syndrome.
11574,1242,IL-7 was observed primarily in the vicinity of lymphocytic infiltrates.
11575,1242,Salivary IL-7 levels in patients with primary SS were higher than those in control subjects.
11576,1242,"In all 30 patients with sicca syndrome, IL-7 expression in LSGs correlated with parameters of both local and peripheral disease."
11577,1242,"Furthermore, IL-7 stimulated T cell-attracting and T cell-differentiating cytokines (monokine induced by interferon-gamma [IFNgamma], IFNgamma-inducible 10-kd protein, IL-12, and IL-15), as well as Th1 (IFNgamma), Th2 (IL-4), Th17 (IL-17A), proinflammatory (tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-1alpha), and regulatory (IL-10 and IL-13) cytokine production by PBMCs."
11578,1242,All of these cytokines were previously shown to be associated with primary SS.
11579,1242,The IL-7-induced increase in IL-10 production in patients with primary SS was reduced compared with that in control subjects.
11580,1242,CONCLUSION: The correlation between LSG IL-7 expression and (local) disease parameters in primary SS as well as the IL-7-mediated induction of inflammatory cytokines indicate that IL-7 might contribute to the immunopathology of primary SS.
11581,1243,OBJECTIVE: To explore the application of parotid R2* values for evaluating Sjgren syndrome (SS).
11582,1243,"METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive SS patients and 24 sex-matched and age-matched healthy volunteers underwent bilateral parotid 3.0 T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including blood oxygenation level dependent sequence."
11583,1243,Parotid R2* values of SS patients and volunteers were compared.
11584,1243,A receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of parotid R2* value alone and in combination with MR nodular grade.
11585,1243,RESULTS: The left parotid R2* value was significantly lower than the right (P = 0.006) in SS patients.
11586,1243,Parotid R2* value in SS patients was significantly lower than that in healthy volunteers (P < 0.001).
11587,1243,"With a cutoff value of 64.14/s, the sensitivity of the parotid R2* value was 62.5% in the diagnosis of SS."
11588,1243,"By combining R2* value with MR nodular grade, the sensitivity reached 87.5%."
11589,1243,CONCLUSIONS: Parotid R2* value contributed to the diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome combined with MR nodular grade.
11590,1244,OBJECTIVES: Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a potent immunomodulatory cytokine involved in Th2- and Th17-mediated immune responses in different autoimmune diseases.
11591,1244,TSLP expression in relation to disease activity was studied in salivary glands of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients as compared to non-SS sicca (nSS) controls.
11592,1244,"METHODS: Tissue sections of minor salivary glands from pSS and nSS patients were stained with monoclonal antibodies against human TSLP, CD3, CD19 and cytokeratin high molecular weight (CK HMW) or stained for Alcian blue to detect mucus production."
11593,1244,The number of TSLP-expressing cells was quantified and expression was correlated to local and systemic disease parameters.
11594,1244,RESULTS: The number of TSLP-expressing cells was significantly lower in pSS patients than in nSS controls and correlated with a range of disease markers.
11595,1244,"In pSS patients, TSLP was expressed outside of lymphocytic infiltrates at sections that also encompassed high numbers of intact acinar cells."
11596,1244,This difference was independent of tissue destruction.
11597,1244,CONCLUSIONS: Reduced TSLP expression in pSS patients is associated with increased local and systemic inflammatory markers.
11598,1244,"Loss of TSLP expression may contribute to Th1/Th17-associated immunopathology in pSS, in line with previous studies demonstrating that TSLP promotes a protective Th2 milieu at mucosal sites."
11599,1245,"Chemokines, small pro-inflammatory cytokines, are involved in migration of inflammatory cells in inflamed tissues and recent studies established their role in angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, cancer and autoimmune conditions."
11600,1245,"Growth related oncogene-alpha (GRO-), a member of the CXC chemokine family, and its receptor CXCR2 are involved in the inflammatory processes."
11601,1245,"Since there is no previous report that supports a possible role of GRO-/CXCR2 receptor complex during inflammation and neovascularization existing in the autoimmune disease Sjgren's syndrome (SS), in this study, we examined CXCR2 and its ligand GRO- expression in SS tissues."
11602,1245,Immunohistochemistry revealed that GRO- and its receptor CXCR2 were expressed at high levels in diseased tissues compared to healthy controls.
11603,1245,"In addition, human salivary gland epithelial cells (SGEC) cultures were submitted to a pro-inflammatory microenvironment using cytokines IL-6 and TNF- in order to demonstrate that CXCR2 may change its initial expression pattern to another under inflammatory condition."
11604,1245,The data show an increased expression of CXCR2 depending on the inflammatory cytokine used in culture in a time-dependent manner.
11605,1245,"Furthermore, silencing of the pro-angiogenic chemokine GRO- is proportionally correlated with decreased expression of CXCR2 in pro-inflammatory cytokine-stimulated SGEC indicating the GRO-/CXCR2 complex as a novel therapeutic target for the chronic inflammatory disease Sjgren's syndrome."
11606,1246,"OBJECTIVE: Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related Mikulicz's disease (MD) is a fibrosis-associated inflammatory disease, often accompanied by lacrimal gland swelling."
11607,1246,"Although much attention has been paid to the inflammatory aspects of this disease, the mechanisms of the fibrotic processes are still unclear."
11608,1246,"We focused on the fibrotic changes occurring in the lacrimal glands of IgG4-related MD patients, by examining molecules involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)."
11609,1246,METHODS: Lacrimal gland tissue specimens were obtained from 3 IgG4-related MD patients and 3 control patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
11610,1246,The glands were examined by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.
11611,1246,"RESULTS: Storiform fibrosis, a characteristic of IgG4-related MD, was observed in the lacrimal glands of IgG4-related MD, but rarely in those of SS."
11612,1246,"Reduced E-cadherin expression, increased phalloidin-stained filamentous actin, and increased -smooth muscle actin, snail, and heat-shock protein 47 levels were observed in the lacrimal glands of IgG4-related MD compared with those of SS."
11613,1246,"Transmission electron microscopy revealed an abnormal periodicity of collagen bundles, and basal membrane thickening in the IgG4-related MD compared with that in the SS tissues."
11614,1246,CONCLUSION: EMT-like changes were frequently observed in the lacrimal gland epithelia from patients with IgG4-related MD.
11615,1246,"Thus, EMT may be involved in the pathology of IgG4-related MD fibrosis."
11616,1247,The treatment of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is based principally on the management of sicca features and systemic manifestations.
11617,1247,"Sicca manifestations are treated symptomatically through administration of topical therapies, such as saliva substitutes and artificial tears; in patients with residual salivary gland function, stimulation of salivary flow with a sialogogue is the therapy of choice."
11618,1247,"The management of extraglandular features must be tailored to the specific organ or organs involved; however, limited data have been obtained from controlled trials in SS to guide the treatment of systemic symptoms using therapies including antimalarials, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive drugs and biologic agents."
11619,1247,"Nevertheless, randomised controlled trials of biologic agents that target molecules and receptors involved in the aetiopathogenesis of primary SS have initiated a new era in the therapeutic management of the disease, although the potential risks and benefits of these agents must be carefully considered."
11620,1247,"In this Review, we analyse the evidence regarding the efficacy of the therapeutic agents currently available to treat the manifestations of SS."
11621,1247,"On the basis of this evidence, we provide guidance on the use of these agents in different clinical scenarios."
11622,1248,INTRODUCTION: In vitro and in vivo experimental data have suggested new immunopathogenic mechanisms in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
11623,1248,The availability of targeted treatment modalities has opened new ways to selectively target these mechanistic pathways in vivo.
11624,1248,"Amongst these new treatment modalities, monoclonal antibodies specific for the B-cell surface molecule CD20 have been shown to be the most promising treatment option to date."
11625,1248,"AREAS COVERED: A search of the Pubmed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and Ovid databases was performed to review literature on the efficacy and safety profile of anti-CD20 therapy in pSS patients."
11626,1248,EXPERT OPINION: A single course of the chimeric humanized anti-CD20 antibody rituximab was effective in reducing disease activity in pSS patients for about six to nine months.
11627,1248,Retreatment of responders resulted in a similar effect to initial treatment.
11628,1248,"When combined with corticosteroids during infusion, rituximab was shown to be a safe drug to administer."
11629,1248,"Thus, anti-CD20 therapy can be considered an effective treatment option in pSS patients."
11630,1248,"However, large randomized controlled trials with anti-CD20 therapy, for example rituximab, are warranted in order to: 1) assess long-term effects of such treatment, 2) determine which pSS patients will benefit most from anti-CD20 treatment and 3) assess which retreatment schedule should be followed."
11631,1249,"OBJECTIVES: Several aquaporins (AQPs) are present in the salivary glands, likely contributing to their secretions."
11632,1249,AQP dysfunction may contribute to the salivary gland dysfunction in SS.
11633,1249,Antibodies to AQP4 and AQP1 are detected in neuromyelitis optica and are believed to play a pathogenic role.
11634,1249,We aimed to search for antibodies to several AQPs in the sera from SS patients in an effort to shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms of SS.
11635,1249,"METHODS: We searched for antibodies to six AQPs in the sera of 34 SS patients without neurological findings using ELISAs with synthetic peptides corresponding to the three extracellular domains of each AQP, radioimmunoassays with AQPs, Western blots and competition experiments with cell-embedded AQPs."
11636,1249,"RESULTS: Thirteen (38.2%) SS patients had antibodies to extracellular domains of AQP1 (two), AQP3 (one), AQP8 (six) or AQP9 (four); none had AQP4 or AQP5 antibodies."
11637,1249,Each patient had antibodies to only one extracellular domain.
11638,1249,"AQP binding was further verified by radioimmunoassay with intact AQPs, western blots and AQP-transfected cells."
11639,1249,"In contrast, none of the 106 healthy controls or 68 patients with other autoimmune diseases had antibodies to intact AQPs."
11640,1249,Expression of AQP8 (the major antibody target) on human salivary glands was shown by immunohistochemistry.
11641,1249,"Patients with anti-AQP antibodies had more severe xeropthalmia compared with anti-AQP-negative patients, suggesting a potential pathogenic role of these antibodies."
11642,1249,CONCLUSION: Antibodies to AQPs (especially to AQP8 and AQP9) are frequent in SS patients.
11643,1249,The likely important role of AQPs in salivary gland secretions justifies further research.
11644,1250,BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common and sometimes debilitating phenomenon in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and other chronic inflammatory diseases.
11645,1250,"We aimed to investigate how IL-1 -related molecules and the neuropeptide hypocretin-1 (Hcrt1), a regulator of wakefulness, influence fatigue."
11646,1250,METHODS: Hcrt1 was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 49 patients with pSS.
11647,1250,"Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-1 receptor type 2 (IL-1RII), IL-6, and S100B protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)."
11648,1250,Fatigue was rated by the fatigue visual analog scale (fVAS).
11649,1250,"RESULTS: Simple univariate regression and multiple regression analyses with fatigue as a dependent variable revealed that depression, pain, and the biochemical variable IL-1Ra had a significant association with fatigue."
11650,1250,"In PCA, two significant components were revealed."
11651,1250,"The first component (PC1) was dominated by variables related to IL-1 activity (IL-1Ra, IL-1RII, and S100B)."
11652,1250,PC2 showed a negative association between IL-6 and Hcrt1.
11653,1250,fVAS was then introduced as an additional variable.
11654,1250,This new model demonstrated that fatigue had a higher association with the IL-1-related PC1 than to PC2.
11655,1250,"Additionally, a third component (PC3) became significant between low Hcrt1 concentrations and fVAS scores."
11656,1250,CONCLUSIONS: The main findings of this study indicate a functional network in which several IL-1-related molecules in CSF influence fatigue in addition to the classical clinical factors of depression and pain.
11657,1250,"The neuropeptide Hcrt1 seems to participate in fatigue generation, but likely not through the IL-1 pathway."
11658,1251,"Sjgren's syndrome is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands, mainly the lacrimal and salivary glands."
11659,1251,"However, extraglandular organ systems may frequently be involved, including the lungs."
11660,1251,"Although subclinical pulmonary inflammation exists in more than 50% of patients, clinically significant pulmonary involvement affects approximately 10% of patients and may be the first manifestation of the disease."
11661,1251,"The entire respiratory tract may be involved, with a wide spectrum of manifestations including xerotrachea and bronchial sicca, obstructive small airway disease, various patterns of interstitial lung disease, lymphoinfiltrative or lymphoproliferative lung disease, such as lymphoma (usually of MALT type), pulmonary hypertension, pleural involvement, lung cysts, and pulmonary amyloidosis."
11662,1252,We report a 70-year-old woman with Sjgren's syndrome who had severe renal dysfunction with mild proteinuria and elevated urinary low-molecular-weight proteins.
11663,1252,"Based on these clinical presentations, interstitial nephritis due to Sjgren's syndrome was strongly suspected."
11664,1252,"Unexpectedly, renal pathology revealed amyloid light-chain (AL) lambda-type depositions predominantly in the vasculatures with severe tubulointerstitial damage."
11665,1252,Concentrated urine immunofixation was positive for Bence Jones lambda-type monoclonal proteins.
11666,1252,"Given the involvement in other organs, systemic AL amyloidosis was diagnosed."
11667,1252,"The patient underwent chemotherapy, but hemodialysis was ultimately instituted."
11668,1252,It should be remembered that renal amyloidosis occurs as a clinical presentation of interstitial nephritis.
11669,1253,"OBJECTIVE: Both Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and non-autoimmune sicca syndrome (nSS) can show symptoms of dry eyes and a dry mouth, and objective reductions in tear and saliva production."
11670,1253,Dry eyes and dry mouth are frequent but they are distinct pathological entities that require diagnostic discrimination.
11671,1253,"METHODS: The aim of present study was to compare the serum levels of sICAM-1, TFF3, RANTES, adiponectin, and FGF in primary (pSS), secondary due to rheumatoid arthritis (sSS), non-autoimmune sicca syndrome (nSS), and healthy groups."
11672,1253,"The serum levels of selected molecules were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 29 patients with pSS, 30 with sSS, 17 with nSS, and 15 healthy subjects."
11673,1253,RESULTS: sICAM-1 was significantly elevated in pSS and sSS patients compared with nSS group.
11674,1253,"Levels of FGF, TFF3, and RANTES were significantly increased in pSS, sSS, and nSS patients compared with healthy controls."
11675,1253,No significant correlations were found between the levels of measured molecules and the clinical parameters.
11676,1253,"CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that sICAM-1 might be useful as an additional parameter for differential diagnosis of SS and nSS, and TFF could be additional diagnostic marker for SS diagnosis."
11677,1253,KEY POINTS:  sICAM-1 was significantly elevated in Sjgren syndrome patients compared with non-autoimmune sicca syndrome group.
11678,1253,TFF was significantly elevated in Sjgren syndrome patients compared with healthy controls.
11679,1253,They might be useful as additional parameters for differential diagnosis.
11680,1254,OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to define the clinical characteristics of anti-centromere antibody and anti-SS-A/Ro antibody (ACA/SS-A) double positive Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and to clarify the clinical impact of these antibodies.
11681,1254,"METHODS: We examined 108 patients (6 males, mean age 57.9 years) with SS who underwent labial salivary gland biopsy."
11682,1254,The patients were divided into four groups by ACA and anti-SS-A/Ro antibody positivity.
11683,1254,"Symptoms, laboratory and pathological data, and scleroderma-related data were compared among the groups."
11684,1254,"RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 16 ACA/SS-A double positive, 20 ACA single positive, 67 SS-A single positive, and 5 ACA/SS-A double negative SS."
11685,1254,ACA/SS-A double positive SS were significantly older than SS-A single positive SS (mean age 71.1 vs. 53.1 years).
11686,1254,They had higher EULAR Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI) at diagnosis (mean 3.81 vs. 0.50) and higher serum IgG (mean 2009 vs. 1389mg/dL) than ACA single positive SS.
11687,1254,No patients developed skin sclerosis during a mean follow-up period of 45.6 months (range: 1-178).
11688,1254,CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that ACA/SS-A double positive SS is distinct from ACA single positive and SSA single positive SS.
11689,1254,The combination of ACA and anti-SS-A/Ro antibody in SS should deserve greater attention in clinical practice.
11690,1255,"PURPOSE: To compare concentrations of tear cytokines in 3 groups composed of Sjgren syndrome (SS) dry eye, non-Sjgren syndrome (non-SS) dry eye, and normal subjects."
11691,1255,Correlations between ocular surface parameters and tear cytokines were also investigated.
11692,1255,DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study.
11693,1255,METHODS: SS dry eye patients (n = 24; 40 eyes) were diagnosed with primary SS according to the criteria set by the American-European Consensus Group.
11694,1255,Non-SS dry eye patients (n = 25; 40 eyes) and normal subjects (n = 21; 35 eyes) were also enrolled.
11695,1255,"Tear concentrations of interleukin (IL)-17, IL-6, IL-10, IL-4, IL-2, interferon  (IFN-), and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) were measured by a multiplex immunobead assay."
11696,1255,"Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), tear film breakup time (TBUT), Schirmer I test, and fluorescein staining scores were obtained from dry eye patients."
11697,1255,"RESULTS: All cytokine levels except for IL-2 were highest in the SS group, followed by non-SS dry eye group and control subjects."
11698,1255,"Concentrations of IL-17, TNF-, and IL-6 were significantly different among the 3 groups (IL-17: SS > control P < .001, non-SS > control P = .042, SS > non-SS P < .001; TNF-: SS > control P = .006, non-SS > control P = .034, SS > non-SS P = .029; IL-6: SS > control P = .002, non-SS > control P = .032, SS > non-SS P = .002)."
11699,1255,"IL-17 was significantly correlated with TBUT (R = -0.22, P = .012) and Schirmer I test (R = -0.36, P = .027) scores in the SS group."
11700,1255,"IL-6 was significantly correlated only with TBUT (R = -0.38, P = .02) in the non-SS group."
11701,1255,CONCLUSIONS: Differences in tear cytokine levels and correlation patterns between SS dry eye and non-SS dry eye patients suggest the involvement of different inflammatory processes as causes of dry eye syndrome.
11702,1256,PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between serologic markers and dry eye severity in subjects with primary Sjgren syndrome (SS).
11703,1256,METHODS: This study evaluated 64 patients diagnosed with primary SS according to the 2012 Sjgren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) classification criteria.
11704,1256,"Serum anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, rheumatoid factor (RF), and antinuclear antibody (ANA) levels, Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), Schirmer I test values, tear film breakup time, and SICCA ocular staining score (OSS) were determined."
11705,1256,"RESULTS: The conjunctival staining scores were 3.3  1.9, 3.6  2.0, 3.4  1.9, and 3.5  1.9 in the positive anti-Ro (25 EU), positive anti-La (25 EU), positive RF (20 IU/mL), and positive ANA (1:320) group, respectively."
11706,1256,"Subjects with positive anti-Ro, anti-La, RF, or ANA had significantly higher conjunctival staining scores compared with those with negative levels (P < 0.05)."
11707,1256,"The total OSS in the positive ANA group was 5.5  3.0, which was significantly higher than the total OSS (3.4  2.1) in the negative ANA group (P = 0.005)."
11708,1256,"Serum RF and ANA levels had strong correlations with conjunctival staining scores and the total OSS but not with corneal staining scores (r = 0.53, P < 0.001 and r = 0.382, P = 0.002)."
11709,1256,"Other ocular parameters (OSDI, Schirmer I test values, and tear film breakup time) did not differ by the serologic marker level."
11710,1256,"Interestingly, the OSDI was positively correlated with the corneal staining score and total OSS (r = 0.646, P < 0.001 and r = 0.476, P < 0.001)."
11711,1256,CONCLUSIONS: Serum RF and ANA levels are associated with conjunctival staining scores and the total OSS according to the SICCA OSS in primary SS.
11712,1257,This report describes the case of a 71-year-old woman with a limited form of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) who had a longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesion from the fourth to the tenth thoracic vertebrae.
11713,1257,"Up to age 75, she had four subsequent recurrences of the myelitis within the same spinal cord area but with no optic neuritis."
11714,1257,Anti-AQP4 antibody was seropositive.
11715,1257,Recurrence within the same spinal cord area might be a characteristic clinical finding in NMO spectrum disorders.
11716,1257,"For such patients, examination for anti-AQP4 antibody might be necessary for the diagnosis and therapy of this disorder."
11717,1258,The purpose of the current study was to determine if saliva contains biomarkers that can be used as diagnostic tools for Sjgren's syndrome (SjS).
11718,1258,Twenty seven SjS patients and 27 age-matched healthy controls were recruited for these studies.
11719,1258,Unstimulated glandular saliva was collected from the Wharton's duct using a suction device.
11720,1258,Two l of salvia were processed for mass spectrometry analyses on a prOTOF 2000 matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization orthogonal time of flight (MALDI O-TOF) mass spectrometer.
11721,1258,Raw data were analyzed using bioinformatic tools to identify biomarkers.
11722,1258,"MALDI O-TOF MS analyses of saliva samples were highly reproducible and the mass spectra generated were very rich in peptides and peptide fragments in the 750-7,500 Da range."
11723,1258,Data analysis using bioinformatic tools resulted in several classification models being built and several biomarkers identified.
11724,1258,"One model based on 7 putative biomarkers yielded a sensitivity of 97.5%, specificity of 97.8% and an accuracy of 97.6%."
11725,1258,One biomarker was present only in SjS samples and was identified as a proteolytic peptide originating from human basic salivary proline-rich protein 3 precursor.
11726,1258,We conclude that salivary biomarkers detected by high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with powerful bioinformatic tools offer the potential to serve as diagnostic/prognostic tools for SjS.
11727,1259,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate associations between salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) and clinical characteristics, disease activity and outcome in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
11728,1259,METHODS: The parotid and submandibular salivary glands were examined by ultrasonography using two different scoring systems proposed by Hocevar et al.
11729,1259,and Milic et al.
11730,1259,on 85 pSS patients.
11731,1259,"Patients with inhomogeneity/hypoechoic areas with scores 2 in parotid and submandibular glands were classified as severe parotid or severe submandibular involvements, respectively."
11732,1259,Disease activity and patient-reported severity were evaluated using the European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) and the European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI).
11733,1259,Salivary gland functional capacity was investigated by unstimulated whole saliva flow rate (U-WSFR).
11734,1259,"RESULTS: Of the activity scores, ESSPRI dryness component was higher in pSS patients who had scores above the cut-off values for Hocevar (6.12.3 vs. 4.92.6, p=0.026)."
11735,1259,"The patients with any type of systemic involvement more frequently showed higher SGUS scores, according to both Hocevar (72.4 vs. 44.6%, p=0.013) and Milic (75.9 vs. 51.8%, p=0.026)."
11736,1259,"These patients also showed a higher percentage of severe parotid/submandibular changes on US imaging (65.5 vs. 33.9%, p=0.005 and 75.9 vs. 51.8%, p=0.026 respectively)."
11737,1259,Higher SGUS scores according to cut-off values of both scoring systems and severe parotid/submandibular involvements were associated with both anti-Ro or double anti-Ro/La autoantibodies and inversely associated with U-WSFR.
11738,1259,CONCLUSIONS: SGUS may be a useful imaging modality for the selection of patients with more severe disease status or who may require a tight follow-up schedule.
11739,1260,INTRODUCTION: Primary Sjogren's Syndrome (pSS) is one of the autoimmune diseases characterized by polyclonal autoantibody production.
11740,1260,The human homologue of the mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) is an important negative regulator of p53.
11741,1260,Our previous study indicated that autoantibody to MDM2 can be detected in systemic lupus erythematosus patients.
11742,1260,The purpose of this study is to study anti-MDM2 autoantibody in pSS patients.
11743,1260,METHODS: Anti-MDM2 autoantibody in sera from 100 pSS patients and 74 normal controls was investigated by ELISA.
11744,1260,Positive samples were further confirmed by western blotting.
11745,1260,Expression of MDM2 in labial gland tissue from pSS patients and normal controls was checked by immunohistochemistry.
11746,1260,The difference in clinical characteristics and laboratory findings between anti-MDM2 positive and anti-MDM2 negative pSS patients was analyzed.
11747,1260,"RESULTS: The presence of anti-MDM2 autoantibody in pSS patients was 21.0%, significantly higher than normal controls (5.40%)."
11748,1260,MDM2 was overexpressed in labial gland from pSS patients.
11749,1260,pSS patients with positive anti-MDM2 were characterized by longer disease duration and more lymphocytes focal gathering in labial gland.
11750,1260,"Prevalence of anemia, thrombocytopenia and anti-SSB was significantly higher in pSS patients with anti-MDM2 autoantibody."
11751,1260,"Titer of anit-MDM2 was negatively associated with hemoglobin level, platelet count, complement 3 level and complement 4 level, positively associated with European Sjogren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI) and level of IgG."
11752,1260,CONCLUSIONS: Anti-MDM2 autoantibody may be used as a potential serological biomarker in pSS disease activity evaluation.
11753,1260,Study on the role of anti-MDM2 or MDM2 in pSS may help us know the pathogenesis mechanism of pSS better.
11754,1261,"Beyond its well-established role in the maintenance of mineral homeostasis, 25-OH-vitamin D deficiency seems to be involved in the development and severity of several autoimmune diseases."
11755,1261,"To date, contrasting data have been reported regarding the presence of hypovitaminosis D in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
11756,1261,"To assess the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in pSS at an early stage of the disease and to evaluate its impact on pSS clinical manifestations and disease activity, unselected consecutive subjects with recent onset dry mouth and/or dry eyes who underwent a comprehensive diagnostic algorithm for pSS (AECG criteria) were prospectively included in the study."
11757,1261,The levels of 25[OH]-D3 were measured by monoclonal antibody immunoradiometric assay.
11758,1261,"Conditions of 25[OH]-D3 severe deficiency, deficiency, and insufficiency were defined as levels <10, <20, and 20-30 ng/ml, respectively, and their frequencies were investigated in pSS patients and controls."
11759,1261,"The levels of 25[OH]-D3 were also correlated with patients' demographic, clinical, and serologic features."
11760,1261,Seventy-six consecutive females were included: 30/76 patients fulfilled the AECG criteria for pSS.
11761,1261,The remaining 46/76 patients represented the control group.
11762,1261,No statistical differences were found in the serum levels of 25[OH]-D3 between pSS patients [median levels = 20 ng/ml (IQR 9.3-26)] and controls [median levels = 22.5 ng/ml (IQR 15.6-33)].
11763,1261,"In particular, the frequency of 25[OH]-D3 severe deficiency was not significantly different in patients with pSS when compared to controls (23 vs. 17.4 %, p value = 0.24)."
11764,1261,"We found a significant correlation between serum 25[OH]-D3 levels and white blood cells count (r = 0.29, p = 0.01)."
11765,1261,"More specifically, leukocytopenia was significantly associated with 25[OH]-D3 severe deficiency, being documented in 40 % of the subjects with a 25[OH]-D3 severe deficiency and in 11 % of the subjects without a severe vitamin D deficiency (p = 0.02)."
11766,1261,We did not observe any further association or correlation between hypovitaminosis D and pSS glandular and extra-glandular features.
11767,1261,"Although the role of hypovitaminosis D in pSS pathogenesis remains controversial, the results of this study encourage the assessment of vitamin D in specific pSS subsets that could mostly benefit from a supplementation."
11768,1262,"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Chinese herbal medicine for nourishing yin, supplementing qi, and activating blood on the expression of interferon- (IFN-)/interleukin-4 (IL-4) in peripheral blood and disease activity in primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) patients, and to study the relationship between the immune balance of Th1/Th2 and the disease activity."
11769,1262,METHODS: A total of 66 pSS patients were randomized with tossing coins method into two groups: the integrative therapy group (34 cases) and the control group (32 cases); and 28 healthy subjects were taken as the normal group.
11770,1262,"The integrative therapy group was treated by Chinese herbal medicines for nourishing yin, supplementing qi, and activating blood combined with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and the control group was treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets."
11771,1262,The treatment course was 3 months for both groups.
11772,1262,"The levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), IFN- and IL-4 in peripheral blood were measured before and after treatment."
11773,1262,"RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, the levels of IgG, ESR, IFN- and IL-4 were significantly increased in pSS patients (P<0.05)."
11774,1262,"Remarkably, after 3 months of treatment, these levels were dramatically decreased in both the integrative therapy group and the control group, although still higher than the normal group."
11775,1262,"The levels of IgG, ESR, IFN- and IL-4 in the integrative therapy group were lower than the control group and the same group before treatment (P<0.05)."
11776,1262,The ratio of IFN-/IL-4 also significantly decreased after treatment.
11777,1262,"Moreover, the level of IFN- and the ratio of IFN-/IL-4 in the integrative therapy group were significantly lower than the control group (P<0.05)."
11778,1262,For all patients the ratio of IFN-/IL-4 before and after treatment was positive correlated with the levels of IgG and ESR.
11779,1262,"CONCLUSION: Chinese herbal medicine for nourishing yin, supplementing qi, and activating blood can alleviate the disease activity of pSS by regulating the immune balance of Th1/Th2."
11780,1263,"OBJECTIVES: Defects in Tyro3/Axl/Mer signaling may lead to impaired phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, eventually contributing to the development of autoimmune disease."
11781,1263,"The association of TAM signaling with several autoimmune disease has been investigated, but it remains unclear in primary Sjgren's syndrome."
11782,1263,"Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the level of TAM signaling in primary Sjgren's syndrome with its clinical significance."
11783,1263,"METHODS: Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction was used to determine the mRNA expression of Mer, Tyro-3, Axl, Gas6, and Protein S in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell from 43 pSS and 46 control."
11784,1263,"The Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay method was used to test plasma levels of soluble TAM signaling from those individuals, and the relationship of their levels with clinical characteristic was evaluated."
11785,1263,"RESULTS: The mRNA expression levels of Tyro-3, Axl were decreased in pSS patients."
11786,1263,"When considering the plasma level, increased levels of soluble Mer was observed with statistically significant difference."
11787,1263,"Soluble Mer levels were positively correlated with IgG levels (r=0.53, P<0.01), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate levels (r=0.44, P<0.01) and Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (r=0.48, P<0.01)."
11788,1263,And the levels of soluble Mer in patients with the presence of SSA/SSB were higher than those without SSA/SSB.
11789,1263,"CONCLUSIONS: The plasma levels of sMer were increased in pSS patients, which was associated with inflammatory response and disease activity."
11790,1264,"Although B cell activating factor (BAFF) and its receptor BR3 are produced and expressed by many cells, their role has been restricted to the lymphocyte lineage."
11791,1264,"Using various techniques (RT-PCR, indirect immunofluorescence, flow cytometry analysis), we observed the expression of BR3 and the production of BAFF by the human salivary gland cell line, by epithelial cells from biopsies of Sjgren's syndrome patients and their controls, but also by salivary gland epithelial cells in culture."
11792,1264,"To decipher the role of BAFF and BR3 on epithelial cells, BAFF and BR3 were neutralized by blocking antibodies or RNA specific inhibitor (siBR3) and epithelial cell survival was analyzed."
11793,1264,Blocking BR3 promotes epithelial cell apoptosis invitro.
11794,1264,This apoptosis resulted in the nuclear translocation of PKC.
11795,1264,BAFF neutralization by various anti-BAFF antibodies leads to different effects depending on the antibody used suggesting that only some forms of BAFF are required for epithelial cell survival.
11796,1264,Our study demonstrates that BR3 is involved in the survival of cultured epithelial cells due to an autocrine effect of BAFF.
11797,1264,It also suggests that epithelial cells produce different forms of BAFF and that only some of them are responsible for this effect.
11798,1265,OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationships between systemic IFN type I (IFN-I) and II (IFN-II) activity and disease manifestations in primary SS (pSS).
11799,1265,METHODS: RT-PCR of multiple IFN-induced genes followed by principal component analysis of whole blood RNA of 50 pSS patients was used to identify indicator genes of systemic IFN-I and IFN-II activities.
11800,1265,"Systemic IFN activation levels were analysed in two independent European cohorts (n = 86 and 55, respectively) and their relationships with clinical features were analysed."
11801,1265,"RESULTS: Three groups could be stratified according to systemic IFN activity: IFN inactive (19-47%), IFN-I (53-81%) and IFN-I + II (35-55%)."
11802,1265,No patient had isolated IFN-II activation.
11803,1265,"IgG levels were highest in patients with IFN-I + II, followed by IFN-I and IFN inactive patients."
11804,1265,The prevalence of anti-SSA and anti-SSB was higher among those with IFN activation.
11805,1265,There was no difference in total-EULAR SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) or ClinESSDAI between the three subject groups.
11806,1265,"For individual ESSDAI domains, only the biological domain scores differed between the three groups (higher among the IFN active groups)."
11807,1265,"For patient reported outcomes, there were no differences in EULAR Sjgren's syndrome patient reported index (ESSPRI), fatigue or dryness between groups, but pain scores were lower in the IFN active groups."
11808,1265,Systemic IFN-I but not IFN-I + II activity appeared to be relatively stable over time.
11809,1265,CONCLUSIONS: Systemic IFN activation is associated with higher activity only in the ESSDAI biological domain but not in other domains or the total score.
11810,1265,Our data raise the possibility that the ESSDAI biological domain score may be a more sensitive endpoint for trials targeting either IFN pathway.
11811,1266,OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a practical prediction rule for the progression from primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) to B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B cell NHL) based on the combination of routinely available clinical and serological disease variables.
11812,1266,"METHODS: The case records of 563 patients with pSS were reviewed, and their demographic, clinical, and immunologic features were collected."
11813,1266,Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for lymphoma development and to create a propensity score for discrimination between patients at risk of B cell NHL and those patients not at risk.
11814,1266,The model was internally validated by resampling procedures.
11815,1266,"RESULTS: Out of 563 patients with pSS, 387 fulfilling the American European Consensus Group criteria (12 with B cell NHL, 375 without B cell NHL) were included in our study."
11816,1266,"Salivary gland enlargement (p = 0.001), low C3 (p = 0.035) and/or C4 levels (p = 0.021), and disease duration (p = 0.001) were identified as independent risk factors for B cell NHL in pSS."
11817,1266,"The optimal threshold of the propensity score was determined at Y = 4.26, which allowed us to identify patients who develop B cell NHL with a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 95%."
11818,1266,"The leave-one-out cross-validated prediction error was 6%, and the median bootstrapped sensitivity and specificity were 71% and 95%, respectively."
11819,1266,"CONCLUSION: We created a ""bedside"" prediction model for the identification of patients with pSS who are at risk for B cell NHL, which revealed an excellent discriminative ability and a good internal and external reproducibility."
11820,1267,OBJECTIVE: To explore the biochemical-immune and pathological characteristics of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) .
11821,1267,METHODS: A total of 76 cases of AIH patients were included from January 2009 to April 2017.
11822,1267,"Among them,there were 40 cases of AIH with SS and 36 cases without SS."
11823,1267,"The liver function,immunological index,histological features,length of first diagnosis and treatment costs were compared between the two groups."
11824,1267,"RESULTS: For AIH+SS group and AIH group,the proportion of women were 97.5% and 77.8%,the proportion of the first diagnosis age less than 60 years were 70% and 47.2%,the median course of disease were 30 months and 9 months,all the difference were statistically significant (P<0.05)."
11825,1267,"The chief complaints in AIH+SS group and AIH group were as follows: cutaneous or scleracterus (52.5% vs. 38.9%),abnormal transaminase (17.5% vs. 44.4%),dryness of mouth and eye (15.0% vs. 2.8%),all the difference were statistically significant (P<0.05)."
11826,1267,"There were no statistically significant difference in hospitalization expenses,and length of stay between the two groups (P>0.05)."
11827,1267,"The median level of total bilirubin (TBIL),direct bilirubin (DBIL) and immunoglobulin (Ig) M of AIH +SS group were higher than those of AIH group,the mean level of albumin (ALB) and complement 3 (C3) of AIH +SS group were lower than those of AIH group,and the positive rate of anti-mitochondrial antibody-M2 (AMA-M2) ,anti-Ro antibody A (SSA),anti-La antibody (SSB) and anti-soluble liver antigen antibody (SLA) of AIH+SS group were higher than those of AIH group (P<0.05)."
11828,1267,There were no statistically significant difference in histological changes of hepatocytes and bile duct injury rate (P>0.05).
11829,1267,CONCLUSION: AIH patients in young and middle-aged women need to be vigilant with SS with main manifestation of skin sclera and high specific autoantibodies positive.
11830,1268,CONTEXT: Type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia (T1HLP) in childhood is most often due to genetic deficiency of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) or other related proteins.
11831,1268,OBJECTIVE: The aim was to report a case of marked hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent acute pancreatitis due to the presence of LPL autoantibody in a young girl who was subsequently diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome.
11832,1268,SUBJECT AND METHODS: A 9-yr-old African-American girl presented with acute pancreatitis and serum triglycerides of 4784 mg/dl.
11833,1268,"Strict restriction of dietary fat reduced serum triglycerides, but she continued to experience recurrent pancreatitis."
11834,1268,"Approximately 18 months thereafter, she developed transient pauciarticular arthritis with elevated serum antinuclear antibody (>1:1280)."
11835,1268,Minor salivary gland biopsy revealed chronic sialadenitis with a dense periductal lymphocytic aggregate suggestive of Sjgren's syndrome.
11836,1268,"Genomic DNA was analyzed for LPL, GPIHBP1, APOA5, APOC2, and LMF1."
11837,1268,Immunoblotting was performed to detect serum LPL autoantibody.
11838,1268,"RESULTS: The patient had no disease-causing variants in LPL, GPIHBP1, APOA5, APOC2, or LMF1."
11839,1268,Immunoblotting revealed serum LPL antibody.
11840,1268,The patient responded to immunosuppressive therapy for Sjgren's syndrome with resolution of hypertriglyceridemia.
11841,1268,CONCLUSIONS: Unexplained T1HLP in childhood could be secondary to LPL deficiency induced by autoantibodies.
11842,1268,"Therefore, diagnosis of autoimmune T1HLP should be entertained if clinical features are suggestive of an autoimmune process."
11843,1269,The suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) negatively regulates the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3)/interleukin (IL)-17 pathway.
11844,1269,The proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 is over-expressed in Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and is a key factor in its pathogenesis.
11845,1269,We hypothesized that IL-17 over-expression in SS results from ineffective regulation by SOCS3.
11846,1269,"The expression of SOCS3 was analysed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SS cases, sicca controls (SC) and healthy controls (HC) and tissue samples from SS, SC and healthy salivary glands (HSG)."
11847,1269,PBMC and salivary gland tissue from SS and controls were dual-immunostained for SOCS3 and IL-17.
11848,1269,"IL-6-stimulated PBMC from SS and controls were evaluated for time-dependent STAT-3 activation and SOCS3 induction, and for IL-17 expression."
11849,1269,Immunoblotting revealed greater levels of SOCS3 in PBMC from SS than SC (P=0017) or HC (P<0001).
11850,1269,"Similarly, the proportion of salivary-gland tissue cells staining for SOCS3 was significantly higher in SS than SC (P=0029) or HSG (P=0021)."
11851,1269,The cells in PBMC/salivary gland samples from controls predominantly expressed either SOCS3 or IL-17.
11852,1269,"However, there was a high frequency of SOCS3/IL-17 co-expression within cells of SS samples."
11853,1269,"IL-6-stimulation of PBMC from SS cases revealed prolonged activation of STAT-3 with reduced negative regulation by SOCS3, and enhanced expression of IL-17."
11854,1269,This study showed that SOCS3 expression is up-regulated in SS.
11855,1269,"However, the absence in SS of the normal inverse relationship between SOCS3 and pSTAT-3/IL-17 indicates a functional disturbance in this signalling cascade."
11856,1269,"Consequently, a reduction in function, rather than a reduction in expression of SOCS3 accounts for the unregulated expression of IL-17 in SS, and may play a crucial role in aetiopathogenesis."
11857,1270,AIM: We described earlier a simultaneously increased that the increased expression of miRNA-146a/b was accompanied by an increase in the expression of and TRAF6 and a decrease in the expression of IRAK1 genes in the peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) patients.
11858,1270,"Recently, the expression of EBV encoded."
11859,1270,RNA (EBER) was published in the B cells of salivary glands of in pSS.
11860,1270,"In the present study, we applied an EBV-EBER1 specific synthetic single stranded complementary DNA molecule (EBV-EBER1-cDNA) to test whether any EBER1 related effect exists also in PBMCs of pSS patients."
11861,1270,"METHODS: In the PBMCs of pSS patients and healthy controls, we investigated in vitro the effects of a synthetic single stranded EBV-EBER1-cDNA molecule, synthetic double-stranded (ds)RNA polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C)] and polyadenylic acid potassium salt poly-adenylic acid [poly-(A)] on the expression of TRAF6 gene tested by qRTPCR."
11862,1270,The release of interferon - was detected by ELISA.
11863,1270,"RESULTS: EBV-EBER1-cDNA resulted in a significant reduction in the expression of TRAF6 in the cells of patients, but in the healthy controls not, whereas the treatments with poly (I:C) and poly-(A) could not reduce the TRAF6 over-expression."
11864,1270,No release of EBER1 could be observed in the culture supernatants of patients with pSS.
11865,1270,"Only the treatment with poly (I:C) resulted in a significant increase of interferon - release, and only in the heathy controls."
11866,1270,No release of EBER1 molecules took place during the culturing of cells.
11867,1270,EBV-EBER- cDNA acted functionally on the cells of patients only.
11868,1270,"CONCLUSION: These findings give a further evidence of the linkage between EBV and pSS, furthermore, they show the possible role of EBV-EBER1 in the induction of increased TRAF6 expression in the peripheral B cells of Sjgren's patients."
11869,1271,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS) have diminished health quality and fatigue, arthralgia along with dryness of the mouth and eyes have major impact on their psychological and social aspects of life."
11870,1271,The purpose of this study was to determine psychological features of patients with pSS.
11871,1271,"We analyzed personality, depression and anxiety of patients with primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS) in comparison with patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls (HC) and assessed their association with sociodemographic factors and comorbidity."
11872,1271,"METHODS: In 105 pSS patients (mean age 51.34 years, mean disease duration 5.98 years), 52 RA patients (mean age 51.37 years, mean disease duration 8.10 years) and 54 HC (mean age 51.35 years) clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were determined and results analyzed."
11873,1271,"At enrollment patients and controls completed the Revisited NEO Personality Inventory Five-Factor model (NEO-PI-R), the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale."
11874,1271,Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS [Version 16.0].
11875,1271,The relative size of the effect was assessed based on standardized estimates of effect size (d).
11876,1271,"RESULTS: Patients with pSS, similarly to RA patients had higher scores of Neuroticism (d = 0.46, p = 0.007) and lower scores of Extraversion (d = 0.51, p = 0.001) and Openness for experience (d = 0.65, p = 0.013) compared to HC."
11877,1271,"There was no significant differences between pSS group and HC in the depression (d = 0.171, p>0.05)."
11878,1271,"However, patients with pSS had higher anxiety in comparison to HC (p<0.0001)."
11879,1271,"In multivariate models, education and satisfaction with family relationships were significant predictors for psychological characteristics of patients, independently of clinical diagnosis."
11880,1271,CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to show that patients with pSS scored high on neuroticism and anxiety and low on sociability.
11881,1271,Education and satisfaction with family relationships predisposed to their psychological profile.
11882,1271,Psychological assessment of patients with pSS may improve understanding and treatment of this clinical condition.
11883,1272,The connective tissue diseases are a variable group of autoimmune mediated disorders characterized by multiorgan damage.
11884,1272,"Pulmonary complications are common, usually occur after the onset of joint symptoms, but can also be initially presenting complaint."
11885,1272,"The respiratory system may be involved in all its component: airways, vessels, parenchyma, pleura and respiratory muscles."
11886,1272,Lung involvement is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in the connective tissue diseases.
11887,1272,"Clinical course is highly variable - can range from mild to rapidly progressive, some processes are reversible, while others are irreversible."
11888,1272,"Thus, the identification of reversible disease , and separately progressive disease, are important clinical issues."
11889,1272,"The frequency, clinical presentation, prognosis and responce to therapy are different, depending on the pattern of involvement as well as on specyfic diagnostic method used to identify it."
11890,1272,High- resolution computed tompography plays an important role in identifying patients with respiratory involvement.
11891,1272,Pulmonary function tests are a sensitive tool detecting interstitial lung disease.
11892,1272,"In this article, pulmonary lung involvement accompanying most frequently apperaing connective tissue diseases - rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, Sjgrens syndrome and mixed connective tissue disaese are reviewed."
11893,1273,Scant knowledge exists on the type of restorative treatments Sjgren's syndrome patients (SSP) receive in spite of their high dental disease burden due to hyposalivation.
11894,1273,Increased adoption of electronic dental records (EDR) could help in leveraging information from these records to assess dental treatment outcomes in SSP.
11895,1273,"In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using EDR to characterize the dental treatments SSP received and assess the longevity of implants in these patients."
11896,1273,We identified 180 SSP in ten years of patients' data at the Indiana University School of Dentistry clinics.
11897,1273,A total of 104 (57.77%) patients received restorative or endodontic treatments.
11898,1273,Eleven patients received 23 implants with a survival rate of 87% at 40 months follow-up.
11899,1273,We conclude that EDR data could be used for characterizing the treatments received by SSP and for assessing treatment outcomes.
11900,1274,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by profound lymphocytic infiltration into the lacrimal and salivary glands, thereby diminished secretory function."
11901,1274,B cell hyper-activation is a predominant feature of SS related to hypergammaglobulinemia and production of autoantibodies.
11902,1274,The adaptor molecule NF-kB activator 1 (Act1) plays an important role in the homeostasis of B cells by attenuating CD40 and B cell-activating factor belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family receptor (BAFFR) signaling.
11903,1274,"Act1-deficient mice develop autoimmune manifestations similar to SS, which are hypergammaglobulinemia, high levels of anti-SSA and anti-SSB autoantibodies."
11904,1274,"In this study, to investigate the role of Act1 in the pathogenesis of SS, we examined Act1mRNA expressions in B cells from patients with SS and discussed the association of Act1 with parameters and clinical manifestations of SS."
11905,1274,We showed the low level of Act1mRNA expression in patients with SS and reciprocal association of Act1 with serum IgG level.
11906,1274,Diminished Act1mRNA expression in SS may be associated with B cell hyperactivity and elevated immunoglobulin production in SS by uncontrolled B cell activation signal through CD40 and BAFFR.
11907,1275,BACKGROUND: Sjgren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the exocrine glands associated with cardiovascular events.
11908,1275,We aimed to evaluate postoperative complications in patients with Sjgren syndrome undergoing noncardiac surgery.
11909,1275,"Specifically, we tested the primary hypothesis that patients with Sjgren syndrome have a greater risk of postoperative cardiovascular complications than those without the disease."
11910,1275,"Our secondary hypotheses were that patients with Sjgren syndrome are at greater risk of thromboembolic complications, microcirculatory complications, and mortality."
11911,1275,METHODS: We obtained censuses of 2009 to 2010 inpatient hospital discharges across 7 states.
11912,1275,Sjgren syndrome was identified by the present-on-admission diagnosis code 710.2.
11913,1275,Each Sjgren n syndrome discharge was propensity matched to 4 control discharges.
11914,1275,"A generalized linear model was used to compare matched Sjgren syndrome patients and controls on risk of in-hospital cardiovascular complications, thromboembolic complications, microcirculatory complications, and mortality."
11915,1275,"RESULTS: Among 5.5 million qualifying discharges, our final matched sample contained 22,785 matched discharges, including 4557 with Sjgren syndrome."
11916,1275,Sixty-six (1.45%) of the matched discharges with Sjgren syndrome and 213 (1.17%) of the matched controls had associated in-hospital cardiovascular complications.
11917,1275,"The adjusted odds ratio (99% confidence interval) was estimated at 1.14 (0.79-1.64), which was not statistically significant (P = 0.35)."
11918,1275,"There were no significant differences in the odds of in-hospital thromboembolic complications (1.12 [0.82-1.53]; P = 0.36), in the odds of in-hospital microcirculatory complications (0.98 [0.77-1.26]; P = 0.86), or in the odds of in-hospital mortality (1.11 [0.76-1.61]; P = 0.49)."
11919,1275,CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Sjgren syndrome does not place patients at an increased risk for postoperative complications or in-hospital mortality.
11920,1276,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether rituximab, an anti-B cell therapy, improves symptoms of fatigue and oral dryness in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
11921,1276,"METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial that included health economic analysis."
11922,1276,"Anti-Ro-positive patients with primary SS, symptomatic fatigue, and oral dryness were recruited from 25 UK rheumatology clinics from August 2011 to January 2014."
11923,1276,"Patients were centrally randomized to receive either intravenous (IV) placebo (250 ml saline) or IV rituximab (1,000 mg in 250 ml saline) in 2 courses at weeks 0, 2, 24, and 26, with pre- and postinfusion medication including corticosteroids."
11924,1276,"The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving a 30% reduction in either fatigue or oral dryness at 48 weeks, as measured by visual analog scale."
11925,1276,"Other outcome measures included salivary and lacrimal flow rates, quality of life, scores on the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index and EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index, symptoms of ocular and overall dryness, pain, globally assessed disease activity, and cost-effectiveness."
11926,1276,RESULTS: All 133 patients who were randomized to receive placebo (n=66) or rituximab (n=67) were included in the primary analysis.
11927,1276,"Among patients with complete data, 21 of 56 placebo-treated patients and 24 of 61 rituximab-treated patients achieved the primary end point."
11928,1276,"After multiple imputation of missing outcomes, response rates in the placebo and rituximab groups were 36.8% and 39.8%, respectively (adjusted odds ratio 1.13 [95% confidence interval 0.50, 2.55])."
11929,1276,There were no significant improvements in any outcome measure except for unstimulated salivary flow.
11930,1276,"The meanSD costs per patient for rituximab and placebo were 10,752264.75 and 2,672241.71, respectively."
11931,1276,"There were slightly more adverse events (AEs) reported in total for rituximab, but there was no difference in serious AEs (10 in each group)."
11932,1276,CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that rituximab is neither clinically effective nor cost-effective in this patient population.
11933,1277,This case describes an 81-year-old woman with a history of Sjgren's syndrome presenting with recurrent falls and poor balance.
11934,1277,"She subsequently developed new and rapidly evolving neurology including hyperaesthesia, spastic paraplegia and sphincteric dysfunction."
11935,1277,"Following serial clinical reviews and detailed investigations, MRI (brainstem and cervicothoracic spine) and a seropositive result for aquaporin 4 IgG, a diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) was made."
11936,1277,This case describes the clinical course of this index patient with an unusual late age of onset.
11937,1277,The report also includes a discussion on NMOSD.
11938,1277,"We review aspects of terminology, brief epidemiology, pathogenesis, notable autoimmune associations, variance in clinical presentation and current diagnostic criteria."
11939,1277,We also review the importance of distinguishing NMOSD from multiple sclerosis in view of the significant implications for treatment and prognosis.
11940,1278,"Primary Sjogren's Syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disease followed by exocrine gland dysfunction, where it has been long stated that 5% of pSS patients are prone to lymphoma development."
11941,1278,"In this work, we use clinical data from 449 pSS patients to develop a first, rule-based, supervised learning model that can be used to predict lymphoma outcomes, as well as, identify prominent features for lymphoma prediction in pSS patients."
11942,1278,"Towards this direction, the gradient boosting method combined with regression tree ensembles is used to derive a rule-based, decision model for lymphoma prediction."
11943,1278,"Our results reveal an average accuracy 87.1% and area under the curve score 88%, highlighting the importance of the C4 value, the rheumatoid factor and the lymphadenopathy factor as prominent lymphoma predictors, among others."
11944,1279,Sjgren syndrome is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease in which there is an increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
11945,1279,Neoplastic lung involvement and the coexistence of different histological types of lymphoma are uncommon in these patients.
11946,1279,"These patients frequently have associated infectious processes, most of them due to oral candidiasis."
11947,1279,"When there is immunodeficiency, the hematogenous spread of the fungus may affect the lungs."
11948,1279,We present the case of a female patient diagnosed with follicular non- Hodgkin lymphoma within the context of long-term Sjgren syndrome.
11949,1279,"In addition to the neoplastic nodal and splenic disease, the PET-CT study showed extensive lung involvement."
11950,1279,"Due to suspicion of a false positive result for pulmonary Candida infection, antifungal treatment was initiated, with no response."
11951,1279,A further histological study showed the presence of a second and different type of lymphoma.
11952,1280,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of IL-2 in the balance of Th17 and Tregs and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of enhanced Th17 differentiation in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients.
11953,1280,"METHODS: This study involved 31 pSS patients, 7 Sicca patients, and 31 healthy subjects."
11954,1280,"Th17 and Treg cells were determined by flow cytometry, and IL-17A was detected by immunohistochemistry."
11955,1280,IL-2 and IL-6 levels were assessed by ELISA and qPCR.
11956,1280,p-STAT5 and p-STAT3 in salivary glands (SGs) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.
11957,1280,The binding of STAT5 and STAT3 to the Il17a gene locus was measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation.
11958,1280,"RESULTS: We found that the percentage of Th17cells was increased in the periphery and SG of pSS patients when compared with healthy subjects, but the Treg cells was unchanged."
11959,1280,"Meanwhile, the IL-2 level was reduced, and the IL-6 and IL-17A level was increased in the plasma of pSS patients."
11960,1280,The ratio of IL-2 and IL-6 level was also decreased and IL-2 level was negatively correlated with the level of IL-17A.
11961,1280,"The expression of Il6 and Il17a mRNA was significantly increased, whereas Foxp3, Tgfb1, Tnfa, and Ifng mRNA were comparable."
11962,1280,"Furthermore, the level of STAT5 phosphorylation (p-STAT5) was reduced and p-STAT3 was enhanced in the SGs and in peripheral CD4(+) T cells of pSS patients."
11963,1280,"In vitro IL-2 treatment-induced STAT5 competed with STAT3 binding in human Il17a locus, leading to decreased Th17 differentiation, which was associated with the reduced transcription activation marker H3K4me3."
11964,1280,"CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated a Treg-independent upregulation of Th17 generation in pSS, which is likely due to a lack of IL-2-mediated suppression of Th17 differentiation."
11965,1280,This study identified a novel mechanism of IL-2-mediated immune suppression in pSS.
11966,1281,OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) has a role in the survival of plasma cells infiltrating salivary glands from SS patients.
11967,1281,METHODS: We performed immunological staining for APRIL in minor salivary glands from SS with a pair of antibodies specifically recognizing APRIL-producing cells and secreted APRIL.
11968,1281,"RESULTS: Despite high leucocyte infiltration, APRIL-producing cells, identified as neutrophils, were rare in SS salivary glands."
11969,1281,"Keratinocytes from the adjacent oral epithelium also produced APRIL, but we never detected significant levels of secreted APRIL in SS salivary glands."
11970,1281,We obtained similar results with B-cell lymphomas associated with SS.
11971,1281,"In fact, there was no significant difference in APRIL production and the level of secreted APRIL in these pathological samples compared with normal corresponding tissues."
11972,1281,"CONCLUSION: The combined observation that APRIL production is not up-regulated in lesions from SS patients, and that secreted APRIL is not retained in these lesions, indicates that plasma cells frequently present in SS lesions may not rely on APRIL for survival, as they do in other rheumatic diseases."
11973,1282,BACKGROUND: Aberrant angiogenesis plays a role in the pathogenesis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
11974,1282,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in stimulatory parotid saliva and in serum in healthy subjects (HS), patients with primary SS (pSS) and secondary SS (sSS) and to evaluate the expression of EGF, proangiogenic VEGF165 and antiangiogenic VEGF165 b mRNA isoforms."
11975,1282,"Additionally, we determined the salivary levels of serine/arginine splicing factor (SRSF1), which regulates VEGF165 and VEGF165 b expression."
11976,1282,MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 34 women (16 with pSS and 18 with sSS) and healthy subjects for blood and saliva sampling.
11977,1282,EGF and VEGF levels in saliva and serum and salivary SRSF1 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
11978,1282,"The expression of VEGF165 , VEGF165 b and EGF in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)."
11979,1282,"RESULTS: There were no differences in the levels of EGF, VEGF, SRSF1 and in the expression of the EGF, VEGF165 and VEGF165 b between HS and SS patients, or between pSS and sSS patients."
11980,1282,"The salivary levels of VEGF165 and EGF were significantly higher in pSS, sSS and HS than serum levels."
11981,1282,Levels of SRSF1 correlated positively with VEGF and EGF levels.
11982,1282,"Levels of EGF, VEGF and SRSF1 correlated with each other."
11983,1282,CONCLUSIONS: The balance of VEGF isoforms is not disturbed in SS.
11984,1282,"Saliva is more sensitive for the detection of EGF and VEGF than serum, but salivary levels of those proteins are not representative for SS."
11985,1283,OBJECTIVES: Non-infectious aortitis often presents with non-specific symptoms leading to inappropriate diagnostic delay.
11986,1283,We intend to describe the clinical spectrum and outcome of patients with aortitis diagnosed at a single centre.
11987,1283,METHODS: We reviewed the clinical charts of patients diagnosed with non-infectious aortitis between January 2010 and December 2013 at the Rheumatology Division from a 1.000-bed tertiary teaching hospital from Northern Spain.
11988,1283,"The diagnosis of aortitis was usually based on FDG-PET-CT scan, and also occasionally on CT or MRI angiography or helical CT-scan."
11989,1283,"RESULTS: During the period of assessment 32 patients (22 women and 10 men; mean age 68 years [range, 45-87]) were diagnosed with aortitis."
11990,1283,The median interval from the onset of symptoms to the diagnosis was 21 months.
11991,1283,FDG-PET CT scan was the most common tool used for the diagnosis of aortitis.
11992,1283,"The underlying conditions were the following: giant cell arteritis (n=13 cases); isolated polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) (n=11); Sjgren's syndrome (n=2), Takayasu arteritis (n= 1); sarcoidosis (n=1), ulcerative colitis (n=1), psoriatic arthritis (n=1), and large-vessel vasculitis that also involved the aorta (n=2)."
11993,1283,"The most common clinical manifestations at diagnosis were: PMR features, often with atypical clinical presentation (n=23 patients, 72%); diffuse lower limb pain (n=16 patients, 50%); constitutional symptoms (n=12 patients, 37%), inflammatory low back pain (n=9 patients, 28%) and fever (n=7 patients, 22%)."
11994,1283,"Acute phase reactants were increased in most cases (median erythrocyte sedimentation rate 46 mm/1st hour, and a median serum C-reactive protein 1.5 mg/dL)."
11995,1283,CONCLUSIONS: Aortitis is not an uncommon condition.
11996,1283,The diagnosis is often delayed.
11997,1283,"Atypical PMR features, unexplained low back or limb pain, constitutional symptoms along with increased acute phase reactants should be considered 'red flags' to suspect the presence of aortitis."
11998,1284,"The aim of our study was to investigate extraarticular manifestations (EAMs) in Turkish patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and also assess the impact of EAMs on various health-related quality of life (HRQoL) domains, including physical, social, emotional, mental functioning, and bodily pain."
11999,1284,A total of 150 patients were included in the study.
12000,1284,EAMs were identified clinically.
12001,1284,"Pulmonary involvement was confirmed by using pulmonary function tests (PFT) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), atlantoaxial subluxation by cervical spine X-rays."
12002,1284,"Peripheral neuropathy, rheumatoid nodules, and Sicca symptoms were picked up on clinical examination."
12003,1284,Peripheral neuropathy was also confirmed by electroneurophysiologic studies.
12004,1284,"Patients were evaluated by Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life (RAQoL), and Short form-36 (SF36)."
12005,1284,The quadrivariate Disease Activity Score- 28 (DAS28) was used for measuring disease activity.
12006,1284,Functional status was evaluated by using the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ).
12007,1284,The severity of pain was documented by using 10-cm Visual Analog Scale-Pain (VAS-pain).
12008,1284,EAMs were observed in 50 patients (33.3%).
12009,1284,"These were pulmonary involvement (28.7%), rheumatoid nodules (14.7%), Sicca Syndrome (8%), peripheral neuropathy (2.7%), and atlantoaxial subluxation (0.7%), respectively."
12010,1284,"It was not recorded any statistically significant difference in HAQ, DAS28, VAS-pain, and RAQoL scores between the patient groups with and without EAMs."
12011,1284,"Patients with EAMs scored significantly lower in physical functioning, role-physical, and role-emotional subgroups of SF36 (P<0.01)."
12012,1284,"Presence of EAMs is not directly associated with disease activity and functional status, but influences negatively HRQoL including physical and emotional functioning."
12013,1285,BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to verify the validity of IL-21 local suppression in submandibular glands of preventing the development of Sjgren's syndrome in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and figure out the mechanism.
12014,1285,METHODS: IL-21 levels in submandibular glands were suppressed by ductal cannulation of IL-21 shRNA lentivirus.
12015,1285,"Then, saliva flow rates (SFR) and histopathologic changes of submandibular glands were measured to assess the severity of disease development."
12016,1285,"Real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the changes of T helper cells and related cytokines."
12017,1285,RESULTS: The reduction in SFRs in NOD mice was significantly alleviated from 9 to 17 weeks of age along with the suppression of IL-21 in submandibular glands.
12018,1285,Lymphocytic infiltration was also milder than control NOD mice.
12019,1285,"Moreover, the lower level of IL-21 led to the down-regulation of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells."
12020,1285,CONCLUSIONS: Local suppression of IL-21 in submandibular glands could retard the development of Sjgren's syndrome in NOD mice.
12021,1285,IL-21 might contribute to the development of B-cell disorder in Sjgren's syndrome via Tfh cells pathway.
12022,1286,"INTRODUCTION: Current diagnostic criteria for Sjogren's syndrome developed by the American College of Rheumatology include the presence of antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro or anti-La autoantibodies."
12023,1286,The purpose of this report is to describe two patients with biopsy-proven Sjogren's syndrome lacking these autoantibodies but identified by antibodies to salivary gland protein 1.
12024,1286,Diagnosis was delayed until salivary gland tumors developed in these patients because of the lack of the classic autoantibodies.
12025,1286,This report emphasizes the existence of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome who lack autoantibodies anti-Ro or anti-La and may therefore be misdiagnosed.
12026,1286,Antibodies to salivary gland protein 1 identify some of these patients.
12027,1286,CASE PRESENTATION: Two patients are described and were seen in the autoimmune disease clinics of the State University of New York (SUNY) at the Buffalo School of Medicine.
12028,1286,"In both patients, chronic dry mouth and dry eye had been dismissed as idiopathic because test results for autoantibodies anti-Ro and anti-La were negative."
12029,1286,Both patients had swelling of major salivary glands that prompted biopsies.
12030,1286,Biopsies of major salivary glands from both cases demonstrated salivary gland tumors and existence of inflammation consistent with Sjogren's syndrome.
12031,1286,Serologic testing revealed antibodies to salivary gland protein 1.
12032,1286,"CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with classic clinical symptoms of dry mouth and eyes do not always show the current serologic markers of Sjogren's syndrome, anti-Ro and anti-La."
12033,1286,"In these cases, investigation for antibodies to salivary gland protein 1 is of importance to make the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome."
12034,1286,"Early diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome is necessary for improved management as well as for vigilance regarding potential complications, such as salivary gland tumors as were seen in the described cases."
12035,1287,OBJECTIVE: CD4(+)CD25(low)GITR(+) T lymphocytes expressing FoxP3 and showing regulatory function have been recently described in healthy donors (HD).
12036,1287,The objective of the study was to investigate their presence and role in patients with primary SS (pSS).
12037,1287,"METHODS: CD4(+)CD25(low)GITR(+) cells circulating in peripheral blood (PB) of patients with pSS were isolated by MACS technique, their phenotype was studied by flow cytometry and real-time PCR, and their function was studied by in vitro co-culture."
12038,1287,CD4(+)CD25(low)GITR(+) cells infiltrating salivary glands (SGs) were revealed by immunohistochemistry.
12039,1287,"RESULTS: Results indicated that conventional CD4(+)CD25(high) regulatory T cells (Tregs) are decreased, whereas CD4(+)CD25(low)GITR(+) cells are expanded in the PB of pSS as compared with HD."
12040,1287,"Phenotypic analysis demonstrated that CD4(+)CD25(low)GITR(+) cells display Treg markers, including FoxP3, TGF- and IL-10, and functional experiments demonstrated that they exert a strong inhibitory activity against autologous effector cells."
12041,1287,CD4(+)CD25(low)GITR(+) cells were detectable in great number in the SG inflammatory infiltrate.
12042,1287,"Interestingly, PB CD4(+)CD25(low)GITR(+) cell expansion was evident only in patients with inactive disease, while conventional CD4(+)CD25(high) Treg number was not associated with disease activity."
12043,1287,"CONCLUSION: The present data demonstrate that circulating CD4(+) cells expressing GITR, but with low levels of CD25 (CD4(+)CD25(low)GITR(+)), are detectable in pSS patients."
12044,1287,"These cells, displaying Treg phenotype and function, are present in SG inflamed tissues and are expanded in the PB of subjects with inactive disease."
12045,1287,Data suggest that the expansion of CD4(+)CD25(low)GITR(+) cells in pSS may represent a counter-regulatory attempt against autoimmune-driven inflammation and may provide a new target for future treatment strategies.
12046,1288,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disease mainly affecting exocrine glands.
12047,1288,"However, a subgroup of patients experiences extraglandular manifestations which worsens disease prognosis."
12048,1288,"To date evidence based guidelines for the management of pSS are lacking, hence the therapeutic approach is mainly based on expert opinion and data from other connective tissue diseases."
12049,1288,"In recent years, several studies have explored the efficacy and safety of biologic agents in pSS and after the failure of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, the attention has been focused on compounds directly targeting B or T lymphocytes."
12050,1288,The aim of this review article is to provide an overview of available data about B and T cell targeting in pSS and of future directions based on ongoing trials.
12051,1289,AIM: To report a rare case of microsporidial and polymicrobial keratitis in a patient with Sjogren's syndrome and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.
12052,1289,METHOD: This is a descriptive case report.
12053,1289,A 66-year-old lady diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) presented to us with microbial keratitis after using a Boston sclera contact lens for a painful epithelial defect.
12054,1289,"After 9 days of medical treatment, she underwent therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty."
12055,1289,RESULTS: 10% potassium hydroxide and calcofluor white wet mount revealed microsporidial spores.
12056,1289,Gram positive cocci and Gram variable bacilli on Gram stain were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium accolens in culture.
12057,1289,Histopathological examination of the corneal tissue confirmed the presence of microsporidial spores.
12058,1289,CONCLUSION: Microsporidal keratitis can occur in patients with severe ocular surface disease due to SS and OCP.
12059,1289,"Predisposing factors include dry eye, local and systemic immunosuppression and Boston scleral contact lens."
12060,1289,Early surgical intervention may be needed to eradicate the infection.
12061,1290,Sjgren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects exocrine glands.
12062,1290,"Renal involvement of Sjgren's syndrome may lead to tubulointerstitial disease, whereas secondary glomerulopathies such as anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-related pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis are rarely observed."
12063,1290,"In addition, crescent glomerulonephritis that is simultaneously positive for both myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA and proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA has never been reported in Sjgren's syndrome."
12064,1290,"Here, we report a case of pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis exhibiting positivity for both MPO- and PR3-ANCAs in a patient with primary Sjgren's syndrome."
12065,1290,"A 71-year-old female was hospitalized for cough, blood-tinged sputum, and dyspnea two weeks after diagnosis with Sjgren's syndrome."
12066,1290,"On admission, serum anti-nuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A antibody, MPO-ANCA, and PR3-ANCA were all positive, and serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine (Cr) levels were 42.7 and 2.9mg/dL, respectively."
12067,1290,"On the seventh day of hospitalization, the patient's serum Cr level was 5.7mg/dL, indicating rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis."
12068,1290,"Renal biopsy resulted in the diagnosis of ANCA-related pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis, for which intravenous methylprednisolone (7mg/kg/day) was administered for three consecutive days, followed by combination therapy with oral prednisolone (1mg/kg/day) and intravenous cyclophosphamide (500mg/m(2))."
12069,1290,"The patient was positive in the Schirmer's I test, and a salivary gland biopsy showed sialadenitis with lympho-plasmacytic infiltrations."
12070,1290,"On day 28 of hospitalization, the patient was discharged after amelioration of respiratory symptoms and azotemia."
12071,1290,"At 6months after discharge, the patient continued to receive appropriate daily medications and was negative for both MPO- and PR3-ANCAs, with a slight elevation in serum Cr levels."
12072,1291,We report in this article central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) caused by hyperviscosity syndrome (HVS) in a young patient with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and Sjgren's syndrome (SjS).
12073,1291,A 32-year-old female was referred to our hospital from a local ophthalmologist.
12074,1291,"Fundoscopic examination and fluorescein angiogram revealed she had a serous retinal detachment in the right eye, together with CRVO (nonischemic type) in both eyes."
12075,1291,"Systemic examinations revealed hyperglobulinemia, increased blood viscosity, increased antinuclear antibody, increased rheumatoid arthritis particle aggregation, and increased anti-SS-A antibody."
12076,1291,"Together with a decreased salivary gland secretory function, she was eventually diagnosed as suffering from SjS."
12077,1291,"Moreover, a large cystic mass was found in the anterior mediastinum on the chest X-ray."
12078,1291,Fine needle biopsy soon revealed she had MALT lymphoma.
12079,1291,"After eight courses of the administration of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CVP), most laboratory values were normalized, including blood viscosity."
12080,1291,"Cystic mass in the anterior mediastinum decreased, and the conditions of CRVO in both eyes had much improved."
12081,1291,Decreased best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the right eye was fully restored by sixth month.
12082,1291,"Not only MALT lymphoma, but also SjS can cause secondary hyperglobulinemia."
12083,1291,"Indeed, immunoelectrophoresis-serum test showed a polyclonal pattern of hyperglobulinemia."
12084,1291,"Therefore, SjS was thought to be the primary reason of hyperglobulinemia in this patient, which induced HVS, eventually causing CRVO."
12085,1291,R-CVP therapy was effective for not only MALT lymphoma but also SjS accompanied with HVS.
12086,1291,"Consequently, R-CVP therapy led to the improvement of CRVO."
12087,1292,"OBJECTIVES: To define the biomarkers associated with lymphoproliferation in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) by distinguishing in separate groups the two best-recognized non-malignant prelymphomatous conditions in pSS, i.e., salivary gland swelling and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (CV)."
12088,1292,METHODS: A multicenter study was conducted in 5 centres.
12089,1292,"Patients fulfilled the following criteria: (1) positive AECG criteria for pSS, (2) serum cryoglobulins evaluated, and (3) lack of hepatitis C virus infection."
12090,1292,"Four groups were distinguished and analysed by multinomial analyses: (1) B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), (2) CV without lymphoma, (3) salivary swelling without NHL (SW), and (4) pSS patients without NHL or prelymphomatous conditions."
12091,1292,RESULTS: Six hundred and sixty-one patients were studied.
12092,1292,"Group 1/NHL comprised 40/661 (6.1%) patients, Group 2/CV 17/661 (2.6%), Group 3/SW 180/661 (27.2%), and Group 4/pSS controls 424/661 (64.1%)."
12093,1292,"Low C4 [relative-risk ratio (RRR) 8.3], cryoglobulins (RRR 6.8), anti-La antibodies (RRR 5.2), and leukopenia (RRR 3.3) were the variables distinguishing Group 1/NHL from Group 4/Controls."
12094,1292,"As concerns the subset of patients with prelymphomatous conditions, the absence of these biomarkers provided a negative predictive value for lymphoma of 98% in patients with salivary swelling (Group 3/SW)."
12095,1292,Additional follow-up studies in patients with SW confirmed the high risk of lymphoma when at least 2/4 biomarkers were positive.
12096,1292,"CONCLUSIONS: Lymphoma-associated biomarkers were defined in a multicentre series of well-characterized patients with pSS, by dissecting the cohort in the pSS-associated prelymphomatous conditions."
12097,1292,"Notably, it was demonstrated for the first time that among the pSS patients with salivary swelling, only those with positive biomarkers present an increased risk of lymphoma evolution."
12098,1293,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary and lacrimal glands.
12099,1293,"The aim of the study was to characterize and compare the presence of diverse cytokines and regulatory T and B cells in lip minor salivary gland (MSG) biopsies from patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), secondary SS (sSS), and patients with connective tissue disease (CTD) without (w/o) SS."
12100,1293,"We included samples of MSG from 15 pSS, 24 sSS (six scleroderma, nine rheumatoid arthritis and nine lupus patients) and 15 patients with CTD w/o SS."
12101,1293,"Tissues were examined by an indirect immunoperoxidase technique (goat polyclonal anti-human IL-19, goat polyclonal anti-human IL-22 or mouse monoclonal anti-human IL-24)."
12102,1293,"To determine the subpopulation of CD4(+)/IL-17A(+)-, CD4(+)/IL-4(+)-, CD4(+)/IFN-(+)-expressing T cells, CD25(+)/Foxp3(+) Treg cells and CD20(+)/IL-10(+)-producing B cell subset, a double-staining procedure was performed."
12103,1293,We estimated the mean percentage of positively staining cells in two fields per sample.
12104,1293,"CD4(+)/IFN-(+), CD4(+)/IL-4(+) and IL-22(+) cell percentages were elevated in both SS varieties; however, the cells were more prevalent in pSS."
12105,1293,Patients with pSS had a high number of CD4(+)/IL-17A(+) and IL-19(+) T cells and a lower percentage of IL-24(+) cells (P < 0.05).
12106,1293,The Treg and IL-10-producing B cells were increased in pSS (P < 0.05).
12107,1293,"Concluding, in our patients, a pro-inflammatory and regulatory balance coexists in SS, being both responses more intense in pSS."
12108,1293,"The explanation of these differences may be related to disease activity, disease duration and treatment."
12109,1294,"Sjogren's syndrome is associated with chronic cough, but sicca symptoms are missing from cough evaluation guidelines."
12110,1294,We evaluated patients with unexplained cough for undiagnosed Sjogren's syndrome.
12111,1294,"Patients referred to our pulmonary clinic (Sheba Medical Center, 2009 to 2012) with unexplained cough and concomitant dry eyes were selected for evaluation."
12112,1294,Unexplained cough was defined as chronic cough of unknown etiology despite algorithm-based evaluation and treatment.
12113,1294,"Patients were evaluated in a dedicated clinic by a pulmonologist, rheumatologist, and ophthalmologist specializing in autoimmune disease."
12114,1294,"Patients completed the Leicester Cough Questionnaire, spirometry, antibody testing for anti Ro/La, ophthalmologic examination with visual acuity, eyelid, ocular surface fluorescein staining, tear break-up time and Schirmer's test, full slit lamp, and fundus examinations."
12115,1294,Four-year follow-up was conducted by telephone questionnaire.
12116,1294,We identified 24 patients among which 22 (21 females) agreed for evaluation.
12117,1294,"Eight patients (36%), seven initially, and one during follow-up were diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) (six secondary and two primary SS)."
12118,1294,"At 4-year follow-up, cough tended to persist and improve in only 37% with SS."
12119,1294,These include 2 (Scl and RA) who received rituximab and 1 (stage 1 sarcoidosis) with spontaneous improvement.
12120,1294,"In contrast, cough improved in most (64%) patients without SS; the majority (eight/nine) report intensified disease-specific treatment (five allergic and three GERD)."
12121,1294,We describe patients in whom unexplained chronic cough was associated with dry eyes.
12122,1294,Focused workup revealed undiagnosed Sjogren's syndrome in 36%.
12123,1294,"Dry eyes, with or without SS, is under-recognized and should be added to diagnostic algorithms for unexplained cough."
12124,1295,RATIONALE: The conception that multiple sclerosis may be challenging to distinguish from demyelinating manifestations of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) was introduced more than 30 years ago.
12125,1295,"However, it is now recognized that the neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) may occur more frequently in SS as opposed to multiple sclerosis."
12126,1295,"Characteristic NMOSD features can include severe attacks of optic neuritis, myelitis which is frequently longitudinally-extensive (spanning at least three vertebral segments on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and an association with anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies."
12127,1295,"In addition, whereas NMOSD was initially thought to spare the brain, it is now recognized that brain lesions occur in a majority of NMOSD patients."
12128,1295,"Therefore, it is important for the multi-disciplinary team of physicians who care for SS patients to understand this widening spectrum of NMOSD as encompassing brain lesions."
12129,1295,"In this case-report we describe clinical features, radiographic findings, and treatment of a SS NMOSD patient presenting with severely decreased visual acuity, visual hallucinations, and encephalopathy."
12130,1295,"PATIENT CONCERNS: The SS NMOSD patient presented with rapid, bilateral onset of severely decreased visual acuity and was therefore suspected as having bilateral optic neuritis."
12131,1295,"DIAGNOSIS: However, the patient lacked stigmata of optic neuritis, instead had visual hallucinations and encephalopathy suggestive of cortical blindness, and was noted to have occipital lobe lesions on brain MRI."
12132,1295,Other radiographic findings included simultaneous enhancement of brainstem and periventricular lesions.
12133,1295,INTERVENTIONS: The patient was initially treated with methylprednisolone with no change in her neurological deficits.
12134,1295,She was then treated with plasma exchange therapy.
12135,1295,"OUTCOMES: The patient had resolution of decreased visual acuity, visual hallucinations, encephalopathy, and contrast-enhancing brain lesions in response to plasma exchange therapy."
12136,1295,LESSON: We provide the first example of severely decreased visual acuity in a NMOSD patient due to cortical blindness and not bilateral optic neuritis.
12137,1295,This finding expands the spectrum of central nervous system syndromes and brain lesions which may occur in NMOSD.
12138,1295,The synchronous enhancement of a brainstem lesion (known to occur in NMOSD) with occipital lobe lesions also suggests that our patient's occipital lobe findings were due to NMOSD.
12139,1295,All of our patient's findings had an excellent clinical and radiographic response to plasma exchange therapy.
12140,1296,Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP) is a specific marker for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.
12141,1296,"However, this antibody can be detected in other rheumatic diseases and even in healthy people."
12142,1296,This study aims to determine the prevalence and the clinical significance of anti-CCP in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS).
12143,1296,We analyzed the clinical and laboratory data of 95 patients with pSS by retrospective review of their medical records.
12144,1296,Anti-CCP was measured by ELISA kit.
12145,1296,"Anti-CCP, rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-nuclear antibody, anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, and clinical data were investigated."
12146,1296,We analyzed clinical and serologic characteristics of anti-CCP-positive patients.
12147,1296,Twenty-one patients (22.1%) had positive anti-CCP (mean titer 61.6  15.6 U/ml) and 40 patients (42.1%) had positive RF (mean titer 98.8  22.7 IU/ml).
12148,1296,"Seventy-nine patients (83.1%) had arthralgia, and 31 patients (32.6%) had non-erosive arthritis on physical examination and radiologic images."
12149,1296,"Anti-CCP-positive patients had more frequently positive RF (71.4% vs. 41.8%, P = 0.01) and anti-Ro antibody (85.7% vs. 60.8%, P = 0.03)."
12150,1296,"Anti-CCP-positive patients had non-erosive arthritis more frequently than anti-CCP-negative patients (76.1% vs. 21.6%, P < 0.01)."
12151,1296,"The prevalence of anti-CCP was 22.1% in pSS, and anti-CCP was associated with non-erosive arthritis, and positivity of RF and anti-Ro antibody."
12152,1297,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of gustatory stimulants of salivary secretion (GSSS) on Sjgren's syndrome patients' self-perception of xerostomia, oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and salivary secretion."
12153,1297,METHODS: A total of 110 Sjgren's syndrome patients were randomly allocated to be treated with either a malic acid lozenge or a citric acid mouthwash and then crossed over.
12154,1297,"Before and after the interventions, the Xerostomia Inventory 5 (SXI-5-PL) and the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14-PT) questionnaires (both in the Portuguese language) were administered to patients."
12155,1297,"Unstimulated, mechanical and gustatory-stimulated salivary flows were determined."
12156,1297,Repeated measures and between-subject analyses were performed.
12157,1297,Statistical significance was set at 5%.
12158,1297,"RESULTS: After the intervention and within each group, both GSSS elicited a reduction in the SXI-5-PL and OHIP-14-PT scores and an increase in salivary output, significant in the malic acid lozenge group."
12159,1297,The malic acid treatment resulted in a greater effect size and percentage improvement than citric acid mouthwash.
12160,1297,The malic acid lozenge also produced a significant greater salivary output than the citric acid rising solution.
12161,1297,"CONCLUSIONS: In Sjgren's syndrome patients, lozenges containing malic acid increased saliva production and xerostomia relief, resulting in improved quality of life."
12162,1298,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of proteasome immunosubunit low molecular weight polypeptide (LMP)2 and LMP7 in labial glands of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome patients, and thus explore their role in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and pathogenesis of primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS)."
12163,1298,"METHODS: Labial specimens were collected from 40 patients with pSS, 15 patients with connective tissue diseases other than pSS, and 9 healthy controls."
12164,1298,The expressions of LMP2 and LMP7 in labial specimens were determined using immunohistochemical approaches and analyzed using semi-quantitative methods.
12165,1298,The positive rate of acinar was calculated.
12166,1298,"After the square arcsine transformation of data, the differences of the positive rate in acinar between LMP2 and LMP7 were compared among three groups."
12167,1298,Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used for analyzing the correlation of clinical manifestations with LMP2 and LMP7 expressions.
12168,1298,RESULTS: The expressions of LMP2 and LMP7 within the acinar and ductal epithelial cells were confirmed.
12169,1298,"Although the LMP2 expression in labial specimens was not significantly different among three groups(P=0.369), the expression of LMP7 was significantly higher in pSS patients compared with patients with connective tissue disease and healthy controls (P<0.01)."
12170,1298,"Only in pSS group, LMP7 was found to be with higher positive rate in acinar than LMP2 (P<0.01)."
12171,1298,No significant correlation was found between LMP2/LMP7 and clinical manifestations (P>0.05).
12172,1298,"CONCLUSION: In patients with pSS, the expression of LMP7 (but not LMP2) is up-regulated in labial gland, indicating these two proteins have different genetic regulation mechanisms."
12173,1299,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate ultrasonography (US) grading of salivary gland disease as a predictor of treatment efficacy for impaired salivary function in xerostomia patients with or without Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
12174,1299,METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the prognostic importance of salivary US grading in 317 patients (168 with SS and 149 without SS).
12175,1299,US images of the parotid and submandibular glands in each patient were individually categorized into grades 0-4 based on the extent of damage to the gland; and the sum total grade of the two gland types on either side was assigned a US score of 0-8 for each patient.
12176,1299,The relative importance of US score and demographic and clinical variables was assessed using stepwise multiple regression analysis after various durations of xerostomia treatment.
12177,1299,"RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis indicated that the baseline US score before treatment was the most important factor [standardized regression coefficient () = -0.523, t-statistic (t) = -7.967, P < 0.001] in predicting negative outcomes in SS patients."
12178,1299,"Treatment duration ( = 0.277, t = 4.225, P < 0.001) was also a significant but less important positive variable."
12179,1299,"On the other hand, US grading did not effectively predict treatment outcomes in non-SS patients, with treatment duration ( = 0.199, t = 2.486, P = 0.014) and baseline salivary flow rate before treatment ( = -0.172, t = -2.159, P = 0.032) being significant but weak predictors of positive and negative outcome, respectively."
12180,1299,CONCLUSION: Salivary gland US grading may help to predict outcomes of treatment for impaired salivary function in patients with SS.
12181,1300,"BACKGROUND: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are crucial in maintaining immune tolerance and immune homeostasis, but their role in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is unclear."
12182,1300,This study was designed to explore the role of Tregs in IPF.
12183,1300,"METHODS: Percentages of Tregs and their subpopulations in peripheral blood (PB) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were determined by flow cytometry in 29 patients with IPF, 19 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome-related interstitial pneumonia (pSS-IP), and 23 healthy controls (HCs)."
12184,1300,"RESULTS: In peripheral blood, no difference was found in CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg percentages among patients with IPF, pSS-IP, or HCs."
12185,1300,"However, activated Treg (aTreg) fractions among CD4(+) T cells increased significantly in IPF compared with pSS-IP or HCs."
12186,1300,"Being consistent with the result from the PB, aTreg fractions among CD4(+) T cells in IPF also increased significantly compared with pSS-IP or HCs, accompanied by increased fraction III compared with HCs in BAL."
12187,1300,"IPF patients had lower levels of resting Tregs (rTregs) from the thymus than did HCs, whereas aTreg levels originating from the thymus did not significantly differ from HCs."
12188,1300,"Both rTregs and aTregs proliferated in IPF, with aTregs being more proliferative than rTregs."
12189,1300,Both rTregs and aTregs significantly inhibited proliferation of CD4(+) T lymphocytes in vitro.
12190,1300,The percentage of aTregs was correlated negatively with predicted diffusing capacity values for carbon monoxide and positively with GAP index in IPF.
12191,1300,CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed the imbalance between subpopulations of Tregs in IPF.
12192,1300,Increased aTregs proportion in the peripheral blood correlated inversely with disease severity.
12193,1301,BACKGROUND: Mass cytometry has recently emerged as a promising tool for clinical research.
12194,1301,"However, few studies have demonstrated its benefit for patient stratification and biomarker identification."
12195,1301,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a prototype of chronic autoimmune disease, the pathogenesis of which remains unclear and for which treatment does not exist."
12196,1301,OBJECTIVE: This observational case-control study was designed to discover new cellular biomarkers and therapeutic targets in patients with pSS.
12197,1301,METHODS: Forty-nine patients with pSS and 45 control subjects were enrolled for clinical evaluation and mass cytometry quantification of 34 protein markers in blood.
12198,1301,"For a third of these subjects, matched labial salivary gland biopsy specimens were also analyzed by mass cytometry and immunohistochemistry."
12199,1301,"RESULTS: In salivary gland biopsy specimens from patients with pSS, we identified a high number of activated CD8(+) Tcells, terminally differentiated plasma cells, and activated epithelial cells, pointing to new pathogenic mechanisms for future clinical intervention."
12200,1301,"In blood, we identified a 6-cell disease signature defined by decreased numbers of CD4 and memory B lymphocytes, decreased plasmacytoid dendritic cell numbers, and increased representation of activated CD4 and CD8 Tcells and plasmablasts."
12201,1301,"These blood cellular components correlated with clinical parameters and, when taken together, clustered patients into subsets with distinct disease activity and glandular inflammation."
12202,1301,CONCLUSION: This first application of mass cytometry to a well-stratified clinical cohort and small biopsy tissues establishes the benefits of such an approach for the discovery of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
12203,1301,Similar high-dimensional immunophenotyping strategies could be implemented in longitudinal and interventional clinical settings in this and other disease areas.
12204,1302,"A 24-year-old female presented with generalised weakness, lethargy and aches in legs."
12205,1302,She was subsequently found to be markedly hypokalaemic and have a metabolic acidosis.
12206,1302,A diagnosis of distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) was made.
12207,1302,"In addition to this failure to alkalinise her urine, she was unable to concentrate it and so a diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus was reached."
12208,1302,Further questioning revealed previous investigation of a connective tissue disorder thought to be primary Sjgren's syndrome.
12209,1302,RTA is a recognised but rare complication of Sjgren's syndrome.
12210,1302,Urinary alkalinisation using potassium bicarbonate was instituted; the patient responded well to treatment and is having outpatient follow-up.
12211,1303,AIM: To test the hypothesis that systemic auto-antibodies or hypergammaglobulinemia are related to the prevalence of extra-glandular tissue organ damage (EGOD) in primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
12212,1303,METHODS: A real practice-based investigation of a relatively large (n = 110) Dutch cohort of primary SS patients systematically followed up in a large non-academic hospital.
12213,1303,RESULTS: After a follow up of mean 8.2 years a significant correlation was found between disease duration and the prevalence of EGOD.
12214,1303,We did not observe a relationship between the total number or type of systemic auto-antibodies or hypergammaglobulinemia and the total number of EGOD.
12215,1303,"However, there was a correlation between the prevalence of polyneuropathy (PNP) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) as well as anti-Ro/SS-A positivity and there was an inverse relationship between the presence of anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)."
12216,1303,All PBC cases were anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B negative but ANA positive.
12217,1303,There was a trend for a higher occurrence of pleuro-pulmonary disease in the ANA negative cases.
12218,1303,"CONCLUSIONS: Although we did not find a relationship between the total number or type of systemic auto-antibodies and the total number of EGOD, there were correlations between specific systemic auto-antibodies and specific types of EGOD."
12219,1303,"The presence of ANA and anti-Ro/SS-A was associated with the occurrence of PNP, as well as was the absence of anti-Ro/SS-A with PBC."
12220,1304,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the frequency and characterise the systemic presentation of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) out of the ESSDAI classification in a large international, multi-ethnic cohort of patients."
12221,1304,"METHODS: The Big Data Sjgren Project Consortium is an international, multicentre registry based on world-wide data-sharing and cooperative merging of pre-existing clinical SS databases from leading centres in clinical research in SS from the five continents."
12222,1304,A list of 26 organ-by-organ systemic features not currently included in the ESSDAI classification was defined according to previous studies; these features were retrospectively recorded.
12223,1304,"RESULTS: Information about non-ESSDAI features was available in 6331 patients [5,917 female, mean age at diagnosis 52 years, mainly White (86.3%)]."
12224,1304,A total of 1641 (26%) patients had at least one of the ESSDAI systemic features.
12225,1304,"Cardiovascular manifestations were the most frequent organ-specific group of non-ESSDAI features reported in our patients (17% of the total cohort), with Raynaud's phenomenon being reported in 15%."
12226,1304,"Patients with systemic disease due to non-ESSDAI features had a lower frequency of dry mouth (90.7% vs. 94.1%, p<0.001) and positive minor salivary gland biopsy (86.7% vs. 89%, p=0.033), a higher frequency of anti-Ro/SSA (74.7% vs. 68.7%, p<0.001), anti-La/SSB antibodies (44.5% vs. 40.4%, p=0.004), ANA (82.7% vs. 79.5%, p=0.006), low C3 levels (17.4% vs. 9.7%, p<0.001), low C4 levels (14.4% vs. 9.6%, p<0.001), and positive serum cryoglobulins (8.6% vs. 5.5%, p=0.001)."
12227,1304,"Systemic activity measured by the ESSDAI, clinESSDAI and DAS was higher in patients with systemic disease out of the ESSDAI in comparison with those without these features (p<0.001 for all comparisons)."
12228,1304,"CONCLUSIONS: More than a quarter of patients with primary SS may have systemic manifestations not currently included in the ESSDAI classification, with a wide variety of cardiovascular, digestive, pulmonary, neurological, ocular, ENT (ear, nose, and throat), cutaneous and urological features that increase the scope of the systemic phenotype of the disease."
12229,1304,"However, the individual frequency of each of these non-ESSDAI features was very low, except for Raynaud's phenomenon."
12230,1305,Pulmonary complications associated with Sjgren syndrome (SS) have attracted attention in recent years.
12231,1305,"Sjgren syndrome has been associated with small cyst formation in salivary glands, thymus, and lungs and has been recently brought to the forefront by radiologists due to high-resolution techniques."
12232,1305,"However, pathologists are less aware of this finding unless clinico-radiologic-pathologic correlation is sought."
12233,1305,Formation of large bullae in SS is a rare complication with potential for confusion with other diseases.
12234,1305,"Here, we present the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings in 3 patients with SS associated with multiple pulmonary cystic lesions."
12235,1305,All 3 patients had a variable mixed restrictive and obstructive component of the disease.
12236,1305,"There was good correlation with the pulmonary function tests (PFTs), high-resolution computed tomographic scan, and morphology with regard to the restrictive component."
12237,1305,The small cysts appear to correlate with the extent of obstructive changes on the PFTs.
12238,1305,"However, the large bullae do not, implying noncommunication with the conducting airways."
12239,1305,This noncorrelation between the PFTs and extent of bullous disease with predominant involvement of lower lobes in SS enables distinction from bullous emphysema.
12240,1305,The mechanism of bulla formation in SS appears to be different from bullous emphysema.
12241,1305,"A check valve mechanism has been proposed previously in SS, which does not explain cyst formation in the thymus."
12242,1305,"Alternately, inflammation may play a role with the key suspects being CD4 T-helper cells and perhaps NK cells."
12243,1305,This is the first report of a clinico-radiologic-pathologic correlation with analysis of lymphocyte subsets.
12244,1306,Understanding the formation of Sjogren's lymphocytic infiltrates could permit earlier diagnosis and better outcomes.
12245,1306,We submitted gene transcript abundances in histologically normal rabbit lacrimal glands to principal component analysis.
12246,1306,"The analysis identified a cluster of transcripts associated with Sjgren's foci, including messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for CXC motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF), which dominated the major principal component."
12247,1306,We interpreted the transcript cluster as the signature of a cluster of integrally functioning cells.
12248,1306,"Pregnancy and dryness increased the likelihood that the cluster would develop to high levels, but responses were subject to high levels of stochasticity."
12249,1306,"Analyzing microdissected samples from high- and low-cluster-level glands, we found that certain transcripts, including mRNAs for CC motif chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21), CXCL13, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), CD28, CD25, BAFF, and interleukin 18 (IL-18) were significantly more abundant in immune cell clusters (ICs) from the high-cluster-level gland; mRNAs for CCL2, CD25, and IL-1RA were significantly more abundant in acinus-duct axis samples; mRNAs for CCL4, BAFF, IL-6, and IL-10 were more abundant in some acinus-duct samples; cells with high prolactin immunoreactivity were more frequent in interacinar spaces."
12250,1306,"In conclusion, integrated functional networks comprising Sjgren's infiltrates, such as ICs, acinar cells, ductal cells, and interacinar cells, can form in histologically normal glands, and it is feasible to detect their molecular signatures."
12251,1307,The salivary glands are commonly affected in systemic autoimmune disease and diseases of unknown pathogenesis.
12252,1307,Sjgren syndrome (SjS) can be affected by other systemic diseases.
12253,1307,Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) commonly affects salivary glands.
12254,1307,"Imaging findings are usually nonspecific; however, radiologists should be familiar with the manifestations to avoid diagnostic delay."
12255,1307,Findings of early-stage SjS are difficult to identify on routine computed tomography or MR imaging.
12256,1307,Chronic SjS can be diagnosed from MR imaging and sialographic findings.
12257,1307,Multiglandular and localized involvement of IgG4-RD is difficult to differentiate from malignant lymphoma for multiglandular disease and salivary gland carcinoma for localized disease.
12258,1308,Dermatofibroma is one of the most common entities seen in dermatology clinical practice.
12259,1308,"Several clinical subtypes have nevertheless been described, all of them of uncommon occurrence."
12260,1308,The authors present two rare clinical variants of dermatofibromas: congenital multiple clustered dermatofibroma (the presented case is the 4th congenital case to be reported so far) and multiple eruptive dermatofibromas developing in the setting of a Sjgren's syndrome.
12261,1308,"Since the uncommon subtypes may not be clinically evident, dermatologists should familiarize themselves with their main features and we advise a high level of clinical suspicion in order to reach the correct diagnosis."
12262,1309,OBJECTIVES: To review the existing techniques for minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) in the lip and to suggest a new approach to ease the procedure and reduce post-operative complications.
12263,1309,STUDY DESIGN: A comprehensive literature review and a descriptive study of a new surgical technique.
12264,1309,"RESULTS: Diverse incisions have been suggested for MSGB with different designs (ellipse, circular, linear), different directions (parallel, oblique, vertical) and a wide range of lengths (from 1 mm up to 3 cm), but no comparative studies supporting the advantages of a particular type of incision over the others could be retrieved."
12265,1309,A variety of features of the existing techniques for MSGB are linked to undesired events and surgical complications which could be minimized by modifying certain aspects of these procedures.
12266,1309,"The technique described, together with the use of the S forceps, represents a significant improvement over the already described chalazion forceps because it allows for a better access and positioning of the lower lip, improves the ergonomic conditions of the assistant, and facilitates the identification of lip areas with more superficial gland lobules."
12267,1309,CONCLUSION: The suggested approach for lip MSGB includes a specifically designed instrument whose performance during lip biopsy may contribute to minimize post-operative complications.
12268,1310,"Although the cause and molecular pathways of Sjgren's syndrome are still unknown, basic, clinical, and translational science have started to identify linkages to other known processes."
12269,1310,"With the advent of newer, more sensitive, and more accurate chemokine, cytokine, and genetic analysis, the molecular progression of the disease may be understood."
12270,1310,"The modern technology of sialoendoscopy to treat obstructive sialoadenitis from mucous plugging, and the addition of rituximab to current chemotherapy, have allowed patients with Sjgren's syndrome to have a better quality of life and, if they develop lymphomatous changes, a significant increase in their disease remission and survival rate."
12271,1311,"OBJECTIVES: SS is an autoimmune condition characterized by systemic B-cell activation, autoantibody production and ectopic germinal centres' formation within the salivary gland (SG)."
12272,1311,The extent of SG infiltrate has been proposed as a biomarker of disease severity.
12273,1311,"Plasma levels of CXCL13 correlate with germinal centres' activity in animal models and disease severity in SS, suggesting its potential use as a surrogate serum marker to monitor local B-cell activation."
12274,1311,The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential role of CXCL13 as a biomarker of SG pathology in two independent SS cohorts.
12275,1311,"METHODS: 109 patients with SS were recruited at Sapienza University of Rome (Italy) (n = 60), or at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and Barts Health NHS Trust in London (n = 49)."
12276,1311,Both sera and matched minor SG biopsy were available.
12277,1311,Sicca (n = 57) and healthy subjects' (n = 19) sera were used as control.
12278,1311,RESULTS: CXCL13 serum level was higher in SS patients compared with controls.
12279,1311,"Correlations between its serum levels and a series of histomorphological parameters, including size of the aggregates and the presence germinal centres', were observed."
12280,1311,CONCLUSION: Our data foster the use of CXCL13 to monitor the extent of local pathology in SS and its validation in longitudinal clinical studies.
12281,1312,OBJECTIVE: IL-35 is a newly discovered immunoregulatory cytokine that possesses the ability to inhibit CD4+effector T cells and alleviate autoimmune diseases.
12282,1312,The objective of this study was to investigate IL-35 levels in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) and explore the roles of IL-35 in the pathogenesis of pSS.
12283,1312,"METHODS: Thirty-four hospitalized patients with pSS were recruited, and 34 volunteers were enrolled as healthy controls."
12284,1312,An ELISA was adopted to measure plasma IL-35 levels.
12285,1312,The levels of P35 and EBI3 mRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined using real-time quantitative PCR.
12286,1312,The percentage of CD4+EBI3+T cells and CD19+EBI3+B cells was analysed using flow cytometry.
12287,1312,"Correlations between IL-35 levels, P35 and EBI3 mRNAs, numbers of CD4+EBI3+T cells, CD19+EBI3+B cells and clinical parameters were analysed."
12288,1312,"RESULTS: Significantly lower plasma IL-35 levels, P35 and EBI3 mRNA levels, and percentages of CD4+EBI3+T cells but increased percentages of CD19+EBI3+B cells were observed in patients with pSS than in healthy controls."
12289,1312,"IL-35 levels, EBI3 mRNA expression and the percentage of CD4+EBI3+T cells exhibited negative correlations with the ESSDAI score, whereas levels of the IL-35 protein and EBI3 mRNA were negatively correlated with the ESR."
12290,1312,Patients who were positive for anti-SSB antibodies presented with lower IL-35 levels and percentages of CD4+EBI3+T cells.
12291,1312,"CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, a decrease in the IL-35 levels may play an important role in the pathogenesis of pSS."
12292,1312,IL-35 may act as a potential therapeutic agent against inflammation in patients with pSS.
12293,1313,BACKGROUND: Primary lymph node plasmacytoma is a rare disease that typically involves lymph nodes of the neck.
12294,1313,In only 15% of cases is the disease generalized.
12295,1313,"Here, we present a case of generalized lymph node plasmacytoma in a patient with Sjgren's syndrome with an unusual course."
12296,1313,"CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old white woman presented to our hospital with enlargement of groups of lymph nodes, liver, and spleen."
12297,1313,Her medical history was consistent with a 12-year course of Sjgren's syndrome.
12298,1313,Blood and urine immunochemistry showed a massive (72g/l) M-gradient formed from immunoglobulin A in the serum and monoclonal free -type light chains in her urine.
12299,1313,A skeletal X-ray revealed no bone destruction.
12300,1313,Cytological and histological bone marrow assays showed no signs of plasma cell infiltration.
12301,1313,The microarchitecture of her neck and inguinal lymph nodes was destroyed.
12302,1313,"Only small remnants of B cell follicles were found, while the interfollicular areas were expanded and infiltrated by CD138, MuM1, CD43, and IgA-positive plasma cells."
12303,1313,"After nine cycles of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone chemotherapy, complete remission was achieved."
12304,1313,"However, the lymphoma relapsed 3months later, with histological verification in her femoral lymph node."
12305,1313,"Despite the absence of subsequent adequate therapy, she gradually achieved complete remission of plasmacytoma with the disappearance of paraproteins."
12306,1313,"CONCLUSIONS: Currently, primary lymph node plasmacytoma is generally considered a nodal marginal zone lymphoma with an extensive plasmacytic differentiation."
12307,1313,"In our case, despite the critical histological and immunohistochemical evaluation of three lymph node biopsies from different anatomical areas at different times, no signs of nodal marginal zone lymphoma were found."
12308,1313,An 18-year follow-up of our patient with primary lymph node plasmacytoma demonstrated an extremely unusual clinical course.
12309,1313,"Initially, primary lymph node plasmacytoma was refractory to chemotherapy."
12310,1313,"However, subsequently, she underwent a complete spontaneous remission of plasmacytoma."
12311,1314,OBJECTIVE: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSjS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes dry eye and mouth.
12312,1314,No laboratory parameters to monitor the activation of this disease have been identified.
12313,1314,"Therefore, any possible relationships between salivary and blood myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) and pSjS must be prospectively studied."
12314,1314,"METHODS: Thirty female patients with pSjS, 30 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) without secondary Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) and 28 healthy control women were enrolled in this investigation."
12315,1314,"Analyses of MX1 by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, SS-A (Ro) and SS-B (La) tests by the strip immunoblot method, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) tests by immunofluorescence and the measurement of serum rheumatoid factor (RF), C3, C4, immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were performed."
12316,1314,"RESULTS: The serum level of MX1 in patients without Raynaud phenomenon was higher than in those with Raynaud phenomenon (p:0.029, p<0.05, statistically significant)."
12317,1314,There was a statistically significant positive association between hemoglobin levels and MX1 serum levels.
12318,1314,No statistically significant association was found among the other parameters.
12319,1314,Low MX1 levels were shown to be associated with both a low disease activity score based on the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) and hydroxychloroquine use in all patients.
12320,1314,CONCLUSION: MX1 levels have a considerable impact on the assessment of the disease activity in SjS.
12321,1314,We believe that more-comprehensive studies should be performed on patients with pSjS who do not use hydroxychloroquine to prove this relationship and that MX1 levels should be used as a routine marker for the assessment of pSjS disease activity.
12322,1314,"Further studies are needed to create awareness of the role that MX1 has in the diagnosis of pSjS, which may help to uncover novel pathways for new therapeutic modalities."
12323,1315,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is one of the most common systemic autoimmune diseases.
12324,1315,"At the moment, there is no cure for this disease and its etiopathology is complex."
12325,1315,Interferons (IFNs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease and are a potential treatment target.
12326,1315,"Areas covered: Here we discuss the role of IFNs in pSS pathogenesis, complications encountered upon studying IFN-induced gene expression, and comment on the current knowledge on easy clinical applicable 'IFN signatures'."
12327,1315,The current treatment options targeting IFNs in pSS are summarized and the perspective of potential new strategies discussed.
12328,1315,"Expert commentary: The authors provide their perspective on the role of IFNs in pSS and how this knowledge could be used to improve pSS diagnosis, provide new treatment targets, to monitor clinical trials and to stratify pSS patients in order to move toward precision medicine."
12329,1316,A 77-year-old man presented with poor appetite and dyspnea.
12330,1316,A gastroendoscopy showed an advanced gastric cancer and a CT scan demonstrated diffuse interstitial infiltrative shadows in both lungs.
12331,1316,"Laboratory data showed high level of anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies, suggestive of interstitial pneumonia associated with Sjgren's syndrome."
12332,1316,"Although the levels of KL-6 and SP-D, markers of interstitial pneumonia, decreased after steroid and immunosuppressive therapy, the CT findings of interstitial pneumonia showed no remarkable change."
12333,1316,"Surgery was performed 2 months after the administration of prednisolone since the respiratory function had improved, allowing the administration of general anesthesia."
12334,1316,A CT scan revealed remarkable improvement of the lung lesions after the surgery.
12335,1316,"Therefore, it is likely that Sjgren's syndrome and interstitial pneumonia manifested as paraneoplastic syndromes in the presented case."
12336,1317,"Cutaneous vasculitis may be limited to the skin, a manifestation of systemic vasculitis, or a sign of an important underlying disease state."
12337,1317,A thorough and systematic approach is required for accurate diagnosis and evaluation of such patients to enable appropriate management of the vasculitis and any associated condition.
12338,1317,"Occasionally, cutaneous vasculitis is a manifestation or presenting sign of connective tissue disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjgren syndrome, or another condition."
12339,1317,"Such patients are at risk for poor outcomes related to systemic manifestations of vasculitis, as well as increased severity of the underlying disease."
12340,1317,Recognition of this important subset of patients with skin vasculitis enables appropriate workup and successful management.
12341,1318,"Although autonomic neuropathy may occur as a secondary consequence of various diseases, other patients without any obvious underlying diseases show profound autonomic dysfunctions from the early phase of the disease."
12342,1318,"These idiopathic or primary cases are divided into pure autonomic neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy with sensory impairment, and autonomic neuropathy with sensory and motor impairment based on the concomitance or absence of sensory or motor dysfunctions."
12343,1318,"The discovery of the antiganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody suggested the involvement of immune mechanisms in idiopathic cases, especially in those cases with pure autonomic neuropathy."
12344,1318,The ability to test for the presence of this antibody has significantly expanded the concept of autonomic neuropathy to include cases with a chronic progressive course that mimics pure autonomic failure.
12345,1318,Recent work based on the antiganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody has established autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy as an isolated nosological entity.
12346,1318,"Other forms of primary autonomic neuropathies include acute autonomic and sensory neuropathy and acute autonomic sensory and motor neuropathy, although the nosological relationship of the latter to Guillain-Barr syndrome should be discussed."
12347,1318,"Although the possibility of infectious, metabolic or toxic aetiologies should be carefully excluded in these forms of autonomic neuropathy, the monophasic clinical course and the presence of antecedent infections suggest the involvement of immune mechanisms similar to Guillain-Barr syndrome."
12348,1318,Neuronopathy in the autonomic ganglia is considered to be a common pathology in these autonomic neuropathies.
12349,1318,"In addition, clinically significant autonomic neuropathy may be associated with pre-existing immunological diseases such as paraneoplastic syndrome and Sjgren's syndrome."
12350,1318,An overlap with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy has been suggested in these settings.
12351,1319,Patients with PBC have at least 60% of probability to have an autoimmune extrahepatic condition.
12352,1319,The pathogenesis of these conditions includes a common mechanism involving both innate and adaptive immune responses targeting cholangiocytes and different extrahepatic tissues.
12353,1319,"The recent EASL guidelines recommend the management of these conditions, although detailed practical treatments have not been indicated."
12354,1319,"Autoimmune extrahepatic conditions may include: rheumatologic, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, dermatologic diseases."
12355,1319,This review aims to focus the most important extrahepatic autoimmune conditions associated to PBC with practical recommendation regarding diagnostic approach and management.
12356,1320,OBJECTIVE: To investigate consistency of lymphocyte immunophenotype between labial gland and peripheral blood in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS).
12357,1320,METHODS: Seventy-one pSS patients and 35 patients with maxillofacial trauma were included in the study.
12358,1320,"Based on the ratio of CD20 to CD3 in labial gland from 71 pSS patients, they were divided into the high and (n=48) and low CD20 expression group (n=23)."
12359,1320,"Lymphocyte immunophenotypes in labial glands, course of disease, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, immunoglobulin, and complement levels were analyzed."
12360,1320,"RESULTS: In the labial gland, the levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3c were higher, but C1q was lower in the pSS group than in the control group (all P<.05)."
12361,1320,"CD20 was detected in labial gland samples of all pSS patients, in which CD3 was positive in 66 (93.0%) patients, and negative in 5 (7.0%)."
12362,1320,"The plasma levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, and CRP, and ESR were higher, but serum C4 level was lower in pSS patients than in the control group (all P<.01)."
12363,1320,"Serum IgG level, ESR, and labial gland CD20 were higher in the high CD20 expression group than the low expression group (all P<.05)."
12364,1320,"CONCLUSION: Primary Sjogren's syndrome patients had a higher expression of CD20 positive infiltrating lymphocytes of the labial gland, accompanied with the changes of immunoglobulins, and complements in both the labial gland and peripheral blood."
12365,1321,PURPOSE: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of semiquantitative parameters in salivary gland scintigraphy (SGS) in the diagnostic work-up of primary Sjgren's Syndrome (SS) using the American-European consensus criteria (AECC) as the gold standard.
12366,1321,PATIENTS AND METHODS: 99mTc-pertechnetate-SGS was performed in 110 patients with suspected primary SS.
12367,1321,Uptake ratios (URs) and excretion fractions (EFs) for all parotid and submandibular salivary glands were calculated.
12368,1321,"Patients were divided into SS-positive, SS-negative, and SS-equivocal groups on the basis of the AECC criteria."
12369,1321,SGS semiquantitative parameters were compared per group and cut-off values were defined.
12370,1321,RESULTS: Ninety-six (87%) women and 14 (13%) men with a mean age of 51 years (range: 18-77 years) were included.
12371,1321,"All patients underwent SGS, labial biopsy, Schirmer's test, and antibody tests (anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B)."
12372,1321,"Twenty-four patients were SS positive, 56 patients were SS negative, and 30 patients were SS-equivocal.UR of the parotid glands did not differ between SS-positive and SS-negative groups [mean (range): 3.4 (1.4-6.9) and 3.9 (2.2-6.5), respectively], whereas UR of the submandibular glands were significantly lower in SS-positive patients [mean (range): 2.7 (1.1-5.6) and 3.5 (2.3-5.3), respectively]."
12373,1321,"EF in both parotid and submandibular glands was significantly lower in SS-positive patients compared with SS-negative patients: parotid 24% (range: -4 to 53%) and 36% (range: 15-58%), respectively; submandibular 16% (range: -5 to 46%) and 29% (range: 9-49%), respectively.On the basis of a cut-off value of 2.0 for UR and 20% for EF, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.67, 0.86, 86, and 67%, respectively."
12374,1321,"Of 30 SS-equivocal patients, 15 had a positive SGS, whereas the other 15 were SGS negative."
12375,1321,"In both, there was no correlation with the AECC criteria IV (histopathology) and VI (antibodies)."
12376,1321,"In these cases, the SGS result was decisive."
12377,1321,"CONCLUSION: Quantitative SGS is a valuable tool in the diagnostic management of patients with suspected primary SS, especially in those in whom the nonscintigraphic AECC criteria are not conclusive."
12378,1321,The straightforward quantitative analysis of SGS used in this study can be implemented in any nuclear medicine department.
12379,1322,We demonstrate herein a novel time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TRFIA) with high sensitivity and wide range for quantitative detection of ANA-Ig(GAM) antibodies using a biotin-avidin amplification system.
12380,1322,"The immunoassay was conducted by following procedures for a typical sandwich immunoreactions with cell nucleus form Hela and the Eu(3+)-labeled biotin combined with biotinylated mouse anti-human Ig(GAM) served as the solid nuclear antigen for ANA and the tracer, respectively."
12381,1322,"The sensitivity, specificity, and stability of the kit were evaluated and comparison with the classical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was also made."
12382,1322,"The average intra-assay and interassay CVs detected by the established ANA-Ig(GAM) biotin-avidin-TRFIA were 4.21% and 6.34%, respectively."
12383,1322,"The lower detection limit was 2.24 U/mL, and the mean recovery rate was 100.74%."
12384,1322,"The good measurable range of the established biotin-avidin-TRFIA was within 1.95-64,000 U/mL, while it was only within 32.5-4000 U/mL using an ELISA kit."
12385,1322,The values determined by the biotin-avidin-TRFIA and ELISA correlated well (R2 = 0.989).
12386,1322,"The positive rate of healthy volunteers and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), Sjgren's syndrome (SS), scleroderma, and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) was 0, 100%, 18.5%, 100%, 37.9%, 90.9%, and 92%, respectively."
12387,1322,We conclude that the biotin-avidin-TRFIA we developed gives promise for greater sensitivity and accurate detection for ANA-Ig(GAM) in diagnosing and monitoring autoimmune disorders.
12388,1323,"So far, there was no report on the prevalence and clinical relevance of anti-Ro52 in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients in Korea."
12389,1323,"In this study, we investigated the prevalence and the clinical relevance of anti-Ro52 in Korean patients with pSS."
12390,1323,We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 96 patients with pSS.
12391,1323,"On the first visit clinical manifestations, laboratory features and autoantibodies were assessed."
12392,1323,We divided subjects into 4 groups according to the presence of anti-Ro60 or anti-Ro52 and investigated the association between those autoantibodies and clinical manifestations.
12393,1323,"Anti-Ro52 (66.7%) was the most frequently detected autoantibody, followed by anti-Ro60 (52.1%) and anti-La (49.0%)."
12394,1323,"Patients with anti-Ro52 had higher frequency of liver and muscle involvements than those without, while anti-Ro60 exhibited negative association with liver involvement."
12395,1323,"Anti-Ro52 showed significant relative risk for liver involvement (OR=5.987, P=0.038, 95% CI=1.109-32.326), while anti-Ro60 showed inverse relative risk for liver involvement (OR=0.122, P=0.003, 95% CI=0.031-0.479)."
12396,1323,"Anti-Ro52 also showed significant OR for muscle involvement (OR=9.533, P=0.044, 95% CI=1.059-85.793)."
12397,1323,"In conclusion, anti-Ro52 was the most frequently detected autoantibody except ANA in patients with pSS in Korea."
12398,1323,"Anti-Ro52 was significantly associated with liver and muscle involvements, while anti-Ro60 was inversely associated with liver involvement in Korean patients with pSS."
12399,1324,The aim of this study is to evaluate the hearing behavior of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and primary Sjgren syndrome (PSS) patients and compare them with a healthy control group and with each other.
12400,1324,"A comparative cross-sectional study was performed with a group of 117 female RA patients, a group of 60 female PSS patients, and a 251 female healthy control group."
12401,1324,"Every subject underwent a series of studies including high-frequency audiometry, speech audiometry, and tympanometry."
12402,1324,"The high-frequency audiometry measured 250 to 16,000Hz."
12403,1324,"The 117 patients with RA and the 60 with PSS were diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology criteria / ACR 2010, and the validated classification of the American-European Consensus Group."
12404,1324,"Hearing loss was present in 36.8% of the RA group in 500-3000Hz, 68.4% in 4000-8000Hz, and 94.9% in 10,000-16,000Hz."
12405,1324,"Hearing loss was present in 60% of the PSS group in 500-3000Hz, 70% in 4000-8000Hz, and 100% in 10,000-16,000Hz."
12406,1324,The hearing impairment prevalence of both groups was significantly different (p<0.05) when compared with the healthy control group.
12407,1324,"We also compared the hearing thresholds between RA and PSS patients, finding a significant hearing threshold increase in 500-3000Hz of the PSS group."
12408,1324,This study consolidates the association between RA and PSS with hearing impairment.
12409,1324,"A deeper hearing loss was reported in PSS than in RA patients, demonstrating a greater auditory and speech recognition repercussion."
12410,1325,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS) is associated with increased risk of lymphoproliferative malignancy, and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) is the most frequent type."
12411,1325,"To evaluate CD4+ T lymphocytes distributions in patients with (PSS) and the association of CD4+ T lymphocytopenia with the development of (B-NHL), this study included 8 (PSS) patients associated with B-NHL (group I), 50 (pSS) patients without B-NHL (group II), and 30 healthy volunteers who served as controls."
12412,1325,The frequency of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes distributions and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio was assessed using flow cytometry coulter EPICS-XL and compared between patients groups and controls.
12413,1325,There was statistically significant CD4+ T lymphocytopenia in (PSS) patients with B-NHL than those without lymphoma and controls (P = 0.001).
12414,1325,"Moreover, a significant low CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio 0.8 in group I than group II and controls (P = 0.001) was found."
12415,1325,"Significant positive correlations of CD4+ T lymphocytopenia with other risk factors (parotid swelling, vasculitis, rheumatoid factors, low complement, cryoglobulinemia) were detected."
12416,1325,CD4+ T lymphocytopenia is associated with B-NHL developed in patients with PSS and can be considered as an important predictor of lymphoma.
12417,1326,PURPOSE: Innate immune signaling elicited by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) induces IL-7 production and early inflammatory responses in the salivary gland and accelerates the development of Sjgren's syndrome (SS)-like sialadenitis.
12418,1326,Whether poly I:C can induce similar responses in the lacrimal gland (LAC) has not been characterized.
12419,1326,"In this study, we examined the early responses and pathologic changes of the LAC tissue in response to poly I:C treatment."
12420,1326,"METHODS: Poly I:C or recombinant human IL-7 was injected intraperitoneally into C57BL/6 mice, and the LAC was harvested at different time points."
12421,1326,"Expression of chemokines and cytokines in the LAC was measured by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining, and immunohistochemistry."
12422,1326,Leukocytic infiltration and caspase-3 activation were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry.
12423,1326,Serum antinuclear antibody levels were also determined.
12424,1326,Tear secretion was measured by phenol red cotton threads.
12425,1326,RESULTS: Administration of poly I:C induced IL-7 gene expression and protein production in the LAC.
12426,1326,"Poly I:C also induced the expression of CXCR3 ligands, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IL-23p19, and TNF- in the LAC in an IL-7-dependent fashion."
12427,1326,"Similarly to poly I:C, administration of exogenous IL-7 also up-regulated these proinflammatory mediators."
12428,1326,"Furthermore, repeated administration of poly I:C to C57BL/6 mice over an 8-day period caused leukocytic infiltration and caspase-3 activation in the LAC, antinuclear antibody production, and impaired tear secretion."
12429,1326,"CONCLUSIONS: Poly I:C induces IL-7 production, early inflammatory responses, and characteristic pathologies of SS-like dacryoadenitis in non-autoimmune-prone C57BL/6 mice."
12430,1326,These findings provide new evidence that viral infection-elicited innate immune signaling may be one of the early triggers of SS-like dacryoadenitis.
12431,1327,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a relatively common autoimmune systemic rheumatic disease.
12432,1327,"In addition to sicca syndrome and swollen salivary glands, systemic features manifest in the majority of patients, and are severe in 15%, particularly affecting the joints, skin, lungs, and peripheral nervous system."
12433,1327,"A recent meta-analysis estimated a pooled relative risk of 13.76 for the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly in pSS patients who have parotid enlargement, vasculitis, cryoglobulinemia, and antibodies to Ro and La."
12434,1327,pSS is the underlying diagnosis in one-third of mothers of neonates affected by congenital heart block.
12435,1327,"The diagnosis of pSS is complex and requires a stepwise approach to evaluate symptoms of ocular and oral dryness, objective measures of lacrimal and salivary gland dysfunction, and evidence of autoimmunity with Ro/La autoantibodies and labial salivary gland biopsy."
12436,1327,"It is essential to eliminate other autoimmune diseases, as well as non-autoimmune causes of sicca syndrome, such as menopause, endocrine diseases, anticholinergic effects of drugs, and fibromyalgia, to delineate pSS patients who are at risk of systemic complications."
12437,1327,"Recent major advances in the diagnosis of pSS have been the development of classification criteria, which serve as a template for clinical diagnosis, and outcome measures for use in clinical trials and prospective patient cohorts."
12438,1327,"Clinical data and biological samples from longitudinal cohorts, embedded into clinical practice, will be essential to further improve the diagnosis and management of pSS, increase knowledge about the natural history of the disease, gain insights into its pathogenesis, and stratify patients according to their risk of systemic disease and NHL."
12439,1327,"At present, there is a gap in evidence regarding the role of structured protocols in the management of pSS."
12440,1327,Recent recommendations for the management of sicca symptoms and clinical trials of disease-modifying therapy are discussed.
12441,1328,"Anti-Ro52/tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21) is a ubiquitous antibody found in a number of systemic autoimmune conditions including Sjgren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis, appearing in about half of these patients."
12442,1328,"Once coupled with its closely related antibody, anti-Ro60 as the anti-SSA antibody, anti-Ro52 is emerging as a unique antibody with direct pathogenic disease involvement and distinct clinical properties."
12443,1328,"As a result, recent attention has turned to this antibody and its clinical associations and utility."
12444,1328,"There is a suggestion of anti-Ro52 being associated with more clinical and laboratory markers of disease; however, marked disagreements occur about its association with various clinical entities such as interstitial lung disease and Raynaud's phenomena."
12445,1328,"Nevertheless, with a relative paucity of studies about these across the systemic autoimmunity paradigm, limited confidence can be invested in these conclusions."
12446,1328,"Although the antibody holds great potential as a biomarker, further studies examining its clinical utility are needed."
12447,1328,This paper will review the mechanisms of Ro52 as an autoantigen and the clinical associations of anti-Ro52 in human autoimmunity.
12448,1329,Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice develop Sjgren's-like syndrome (Ss) and a gradual loss of saliva secretory function.
12449,1329,"Our previous study showed that injections of matched normal spleen cells with Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) reversed salivary gland dysfunction in 14-week-old NOD mice, which had established Ss."
12450,1329,"The spleen and bone marrow are closely related organs, and both are among the first sites of hematopoiesis during gestation."
12451,1329,"Noticing a rapidly increasing number of clinical trials using bone marrow (BM) cells treatments for autoimmune diseases, we tested if BM cells can prevent Ss and restore salivary glands' function."
12452,1329,"We injected CFA and MHC class I-matched normal BM cells in 7-week-old NOD mice, which had not yet developed Ss."
12453,1329,We found at week 52 post-treatment that all NOD mice receiving BM cells and CFA had a recovery of salivary flow and were protected from Ss and diabetes.
12454,1329,BM cells-treated mice had their salivary function restored quantitatively and qualitatively.
12455,1329,"Saliva flow was higher (p<0.05) in BM cells-transplanted mice when compared to control mice, which continued to deteriorate over time."
12456,1329,"Total proteins, epidermal growth factor, amylase, and electrolytes concentrations in saliva of BM cells-treated mice were not significantly changed at week 44 and 52 post-therapy when compared to pre-therapy (when the mice did not have Ss)."
12457,1329,Restoration of salivary flow could have resulted from a combination of rescue and paracrine effects from BM cells.
12458,1329,This study suggests that a combined immuno- and cell-based therapy can permanently prevent Ss and restored salivary function in NOD mice.
12459,1330,A 45-year-old woman presented for evaluation for 3months of coughing and dyspnea.
12460,1330,A recent chest CT scan done for workup of her symptoms revealed a 2-cm right-sided pulmonary nodule.
12461,1330,"She had a medical history of Sjgren syndrome, hypertension, and obesity."
12462,1330,She also noted a weight loss of 30 lb over the last 3 years.
12463,1330,"She denied smoking, alcohol consumption, illicit drug use, or occupational exposures."
12464,1330,A chest radiograph done 3 years prior did not reveal any pulmonary nodules.
12465,1330,"She had no personal or family history of arteriovenous malformations, hamartomas, or any malignancies and had been up to date with her breast cancer screening."
12466,1330,She was treated with courses of hydroxychloroquine and mycophenolate mofetil for her Sjgren syndrome and did not have a history of opportunistic pulmonary infections.
12467,1330,She denied any recent travel or exposure to TB.
12468,1331,OBJECTIVE: This study proposes a revision of the literature on the current techniques employed in salivary gland biopsy.
12469,1331,"METHODS: A systematic review of the literature between January 1990 and January 2010 was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials."
12470,1331,The search terms were: 'biopsy AND parotid AND Sjgren'; 'biopsy AND sublingual salivary gland AND Sjgren'; 'biopsy AND minor salivary gland AND Sjgren'; 'biopsy AND labial salivary gland AND Sjgren' and 'biopsy AND salivary glands AND connective disorders'.
12471,1331,RESULTS: No study reporting submandibular salivary gland biopsy was found; 3 studies reported sublingual salivary gland biopsy; 1 study reported palate biopsy; 4 studies reported parotid gland biopsy and 21 studies reported minor salivary gland biopsy.
12472,1331,CONCLUSION: Biopsy of salivary glands must be performed as last investigation and only when the other items are not complete enough to satisfy the diagnosis.
12473,1331,The knowledge of complications and sequelae may be useful in order to minimize the risk.
12474,1332,Feedback regulation of transcription factor NF-kappaB by its inhibitor IkappaBalpha plays an essential role in control of NF-kappaB activity.
12475,1332,"To understand the biological significance of IkappaBalpha-mediated feedback regulation of NF-kappaB, we generated mice harboring mutated kappaB enhancers in the promoter of the IkappaBalpha gene (IkappaBalpha(M/M)) to inhibit NF-kappaB-regulated IkappaBalpha expression."
12476,1332,"Here, we report that these mutant mice are defective in NF-kappaB-induced expression of IkappaBalpha."
12477,1332,"This defective feedback regulation of NF-kappaB by IkappaBalpha not only altered activity of NF-kappaB, but also the expression of NF-kappaB-regulated genes."
12478,1332,"As a result, IkappaBalpha(M/M), the homozygous knock-in mice with mutated kappaB enhancers in the IkappaBalpha promoter, acquire shorten life span, hypersensitivity to septic shock, abnormal T-cell development and activation, and Sjgren's Syndrome."
12479,1332,"These findings therefore demonstrate that the IkappaBalpha-mediated feedback regulation of NF-kappaB has an essential role in controlling T-cell development and functions, provide mechanistic insight into the development of Sjgren's Syndrome, and suggest the potential of NF-kappaB signaling as a therapeutic target for Sjgren's Syndrome and other autoimmune diseases."
12480,1333,OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of the main immunological markers on the disease phenotype at diagnosis in a large international cohort of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SjS).
12481,1333,"METHODS: The Big Data Sjgren Project Consortium is an international, multicentre registry created in 2014."
12482,1333,"As a first step, baseline clinical information from leading centres on clinical research in SjS of the 5 continents was collected."
12483,1333,The centres shared a harmonised data architecture and conducted cooperative online efforts in order to refine collected data under the coordination of a big data statistical team.
12484,1333,Inclusion criteria were the fulfillment of the 2002 classification criteria.
12485,1333,Immunological tests were carried out using standard commercial assays.
12486,1333,"RESULTS: By January 2018, the participant centres had included 10,500 valid patients from 22 countries."
12487,1333,"The cohort included 9,806 (93%) women and 694 (7%) men, with a mean age at diagnosis of primary SjS of 53 years, mainly White (78%) and included from European countries (71%)."
12488,1333,"The frequency of positive immunological markers at diagnosis was 79.3% for ANA, 73.2% for anti-Ro, 48.6% for RF, 45.1% for anti- La, 13.4% for low C3 levels, 14.5% for low C4 levels and 7.3% for cryoglobulins."
12489,1333,"Positive autoantibodies (ANA, Ro, La) correlated with a positive result in salivary gland biopsy, while hypocomplementaemia and especially cryoglo-bulinaemia correlated with systemic activity (mean ESSDAI score of 17.7 for cryoglobulins, 11.3 for low C3 and 9.2 for low C4, in comparison with 3.8 for negative markers)."
12490,1333,"The immunological markers with a great number of statistically-significant associations (p<0.001) in the organ-by-organ ESS- DAI evaluation were cryoglobulins (9 domains), low C3 (8 domains), anti-La (7 domains) and low C4 (6 domains)."
12491,1333,"CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the strong influence of immunological markers on the phenotype of primary SjS at diagnosis in the largest multi-ethnic international cohort ever analysed, with a greater influence for cryoglobulinaemic-related markers in comparison with Ro/La autoantibodies and ANA."
12492,1333,"Immunological patterns play a central role in the phenotypic expression of the disease already at the time of diagnosis, and may guide physicians to design a specific personalised management during the follow-up of patients with primary SjS."
12493,1334,OBJECTIVES: To determine which outcome measures detected rituximab efficacy in the Tolerance and Efficacy of Rituximab in Sjgren's Disease (TEARS) trial and to create a composite endpoint for future trials in primary SS (pSS).
12494,1334,METHODS: Post hoc analysis of the multicentre randomized placebo-controlled double-blind TEARS trial.
12495,1334,"The results were validated using data from two other randomized controlled trials in pSS, assessing rituximab (single-centre trial in the Netherlands) and infliximab, respectively."
12496,1334,"RESULTS: Five outcome measures were improved by rituximab in the TEARS trial: patient-assessed visual analogue scale scores for fatigue, oral dryness and ocular dryness, unstimulated whole salivary flow and ESR."
12497,1334,"We combined these measures into a composite endpoint, the SS Responder Index (SSRI), and we defined an SSRI-30 response as a 30% improvement in at least two of five outcome measures."
12498,1334,"In TEARS, the proportions of patients with an SSRI-30 response in the rituximab and placebo groups at 6, 16 and 24 weeks were 47% vs 21%, 50% vs 7% and 55% vs 20%, respectively (P < 0.01 for all comparisons)."
12499,1334,"SSRI-30 response rates after 12 and 24 weeks in the single-centre rituximab trial were 68% (13/19) vs 40% (4/10) and 74% (14/19) vs 40% (4/10), respectively."
12500,1334,No significant differences in SSRI-30 response rates were found between infliximab and placebo at any of the time points in the infliximab trial.
12501,1334,CONCLUSION: A core set of outcome measures used in combination suggests that rituximab could be effective and infliximab ineffective in pSS.
12502,1334,The SSRI might prove useful as the primary outcome measure for future therapeutic trials in pSS.
12503,1335,"AIM: Although the etiology of plasma cell dyscrasia is poorly understood, there is evidence for immune dysregulation or sustained immune stimulation playing a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of these diseases, including chronic infection and autoimmune disorders."
12504,1335,"In this study, we report four autoimmune disease cases where monoclonal gammopathy (MG) was incidentally found during follow-up."
12505,1335,"METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts and laboratory test results in the following four cases: neuromyelitis optica, Kikuchi disease, Sjgren syndrome and ankylosing spondylosis."
12506,1335,RESULTS: The four patients were older than 55years and the male-to-female ratio was 2:2.
12507,1335,"The autoimmune disease in each case developed differently because two patients had coincidental detection of MG, whereas MG was detected 2years and 10years after diagnosis in the other two patients."
12508,1335,The amount of M-components in the blood for two cases was 1g/dL.
12509,1335,"For the other two subjects, M-components were 3g/dL."
12510,1335,"CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of MG of undetermined significance (MGUS) has been noted in a series of patients with immune disorders, suggesting a possible association with MG. Further studies should focus on determining how MG relates to various clinical information and laboratory parameters, such as disease duration, disease activity and higher sedimentation rate."
12511,1335,"In the future, we also need to identify which stimuli, such as cytokine types and levels, can induce lymphocyte clonal transformation and the production of monoclonal antibodies."
12512,1336,"The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical and serological features of patients with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) of a rheumatology referral center in Cali, Colombia, who were followed for a year."
12513,1336,A retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients with an initial diagnosis of UCTD and monitoring for at least 12 months was carried out.
12514,1336,"A total of 94 patients with UCTD (97.9% women) were evaluated, with an average follow-up of 51  35.7 months."
12515,1336,"Only 13 patients (13.8%) evolved into a defined connective tissue disease (CTD), of which 8.5% (n:8) developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 4.2% (n:4) Sjgren syndrome (SS) and 1.1% (n:1) rheumatoid arthritis (RA)."
12516,1336,A mean period of 35.8  29.2 months between UCTD diagnosis and definite develop of a CTD was found.
12517,1336,"Arthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon and photosensitivity were statistically significant (<0.001) for development of CTD."
12518,1336,"After a mean follow-up of 4.25 years, most of the patients with UCTD showed a favorable evolution."
12519,1336,"Arthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon and the presence of photosensitivity were predictors for the development of CTD."
12520,1336,It requires a consensus to establish criteria for the classification of UCTD.
12521,1337,"OBJECTIVES: Recently, the use of saliva as a diagnostic tool has gained considerable attention because it is non-invasive and easy to perform repeatedly."
12522,1337,"In this study, we focused on soluble molecules in saliva to establish a new diagnostic method for xerostomia."
12523,1337,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saliva was obtained from 90 patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS), 22 patients with xerostomia associated with neurogenic/neuropsychiatric disorders and drugs (XND), 30 patients with radiation-induced xerostomia (RX), and 36 healthy controls."
12524,1337,Concentrations of helper T (Th) cytokines in saliva were measured by flow cytometric analysis.
12525,1337,Concentrations of secretory IgA (SIgA) and chromogranin A (CgA) were measured by ELISA.
12526,1337,"RESULTS: Unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva from patients with SS, XND, and RX was significantly reduced compared with controls."
12527,1337,Th1 and Th2 cytokines from SS patients were significantly higher than controls.
12528,1337,"Furthermore, Th2 cytokines were closely associated with strong lymphocytic accumulation in salivary glands from SS patients, while Th1 and Th17 cytokines were negatively associated."
12529,1337,SIgA levels were not significantly different between all patient groups and controls.
12530,1337,CgA levels from XND patients were significantly higher than controls.
12531,1337,"CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of cytokines, CgA, and SIgA in saliva is suggested to be useful for the diagnosis of xerostomia and also to reveal disease status."
12532,1338,This chapter summarizes recent advances in the pathogenesis and management of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
12533,1338,"Major topics are newly described pathomechanisms and cutaneous manifestations of SS, with special references to hypohidrosis and related mucocutaneous manifestations."
12534,1338,"Although the significance of cutaneous manifestations in SS has been gradually recognized in rheumatologists, sudomotor function has not been fully evaluated and recognized in the diagnosis of SS except by dermatologists."
12535,1338,"SS is a relatively underestimated collagen disease in contrast to systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, or dermatomyositis, and special care is needed not to misdiagnose SS when we see patients with common skin diseases such as drug eruption, infectious skin disease, or xerosis in daily practice."
12536,1338,"In contrast to SS, the reduced sweating function seen in atopic dermatitis (AD) is restricted only to axon reflex-induced indirect sweating, which is usually restored to normal levels after improvement of the dermatitis."
12537,1338,"Therefore, the xerotic skin lesions seen in SS and AD might be attributable to different pathomechanisms with similar dry skin manifestations."
12538,1338,"It is well known that dry skin is occasionally seen in SS, and clinical use of muscarinic M3-receptor agonists occasionally improves this condition through recovery of sweating function."
12539,1338,"Therefore, this M3-receptor agonist might be a promising drug and should be evaluated for the treatment of impaired sweating in AD complicated with or without SS."
12540,1339,Lupus alopecia is usually difficult to treat.
12541,1339,We report a case of a 40-year-old woman with Sjgren's syndrome and atopic dermatitis who presented with discoid lupus erythematosus on the forearms and lupus erythematosus profundus with alopecia involving the scalp.
12542,1339,"A biopsy specimen taken from the discoid lupus erythematosus lesion on the forearm further exhibited a xanthomatous reaction, which however was not detected in another specimen from the lupus erythematosus profundus on the scalp."
12543,1339,Treatment with oral hydroxychloroquine showed dramatic effects and complete hair regrowth was obtained 3 months later.
12544,1340,OBJECTIVE: To develop ultrasound (US) definitions and a US novel scoring system for major salivary gland (SG) lesions in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and to test their intrareader and inter-reader reliability using US video clips.
12545,1340,"METHODS: Twenty-five rheumatologists were subjected to a three-round, web-based Delphi process in order to agree on (1) definitions and scanning procedure of salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS): parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands (PG, SMG and SLG); (2) definitions for the elementary SGUS lesions in patients with Sjgren's syndrome; (3) scoring system for grading changes."
12546,1340,The experts rated the statements on a 1-5 Likert scale.
12547,1340,"In the second step, SGUS video clips of patients with pSS and non-pSS sicca cases were collected containing various spectrums of disease severity followed by an intrareader and inter-reader reliability exercise."
12548,1340,Each video clip was evaluated according to the agreed definitions.
12549,1340,RESULTS: Consensual definitions were developed after three Delphi rounds.
12550,1340,"Among the three selected SGs, US assessment of PGs and SMGs was agreed on."
12551,1340,"Agreement was reached to score only greyscale lesions and to focus on anechoic/hypoechoic foci in a semiquantitative matter or, if not possible on a qualitatively (present/absent) evaluation of fatty or fibrous lesions."
12552,1340,Intrareader reliability for detecting and scoring these lesions was excellent (Cohen's kappa 0.81) and inter-reader reliability was good (Light's kappa 0.66).
12553,1340,CONCLUSION: New definitions for developing a novel semiquantitative US score in patients with pSS were developed and tested on video clips.
12554,1340,"Inter-reader and intrareader reliabilities were good and excellent, respectively."
12555,1341,OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To review our preliminary experience with diagnostic and therapeutic sialendoscopy for the management of non-neoplastic disorders of the salivary gland.
12556,1341,STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
12557,1341,METHODS: Thirty-three consecutive patients undergoing 36 sialendoscopy procedures performed at a tertiary medical center from July 2008 to July 2010 were included.
12558,1341,"RESULTS: The mean age of presentation was 43 years (range, 7-74 years), and 61% of patients were male."
12559,1341,"Indications included sialolithiasis (47%; 17 of 36), recurrent sialadenitis (44%, 16 of 36), and Sjgren's syndrome (8%; three of 36)."
12560,1341,Successful endoscopy was performed in 97% (35 of 36).
12561,1341,A papillotomy for access was necessary in 25% (nine of 36).
12562,1341,"In patients with sialolithiasis (n = 17), the mean size of the stones was 7.3 mm (range, 1-20 mm)."
12563,1341,Complete stone removal was achieved in 76% (13 of 17) of cases.
12564,1341,"Endoscopic stone removal was possible in 29% (five of 17), and a combined approach technique was required in 47% (eight of 17)."
12565,1341,"Seventy-two percent (26 of 36) of patients had complete resolution of symptoms after sialendoscopy, with 19% (seven of 36) having partial resolution of symptoms."
12566,1341,Patients with partial improvement of symptoms had a mean duration of improvement of 4.7 months.
12567,1341,The overall complication rate was 22% (eight of 36).
12568,1341,"The major and minor complication rates were 3% (one of 36) and 19% (seven of 36), respectively."
12569,1341,CONCLUSIONS: Sialendoscopy is safe and effective in managing non-neoplastic salivary gland disorders with low rates of major complications.
12570,1341,"Knowledge of options to navigate the rate-limiting steps, like dilation of the papilla and careful case selection, are key to successful outcomes."
12571,1342,Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection disturbs the host's immune function and often coexists with various autoimmune and/or systemic rheumatic diseases with manifestations that sometimes overlap with each other.
12572,1342,We herein present the case of a 43-year-old Japanese man infected with HIV who exhibited elevated serum creatine kinase and transaminases levels without any symptoms.
12573,1342,"He was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis, polymyositis and Sjgren's syndrome and received combined antiretroviral therapy (cART); however, the laboratory abnormalities persisted."
12574,1342,"We successfully administered cART with the addition of oral prednisolone, and the patient's condition recovered without side effects related to the metabolic or immunosuppressive effects of these drugs."
12575,1343,OBJECTIVES: Adjuvant-induced innate immune responses have been suspected to play a role in the initiation of certain autoimmune disorders.
12576,1343,"This study investigates the role of alum, an aluminum-based adjuvant in the induction of Sjgren's syndrome-like disorder in mice."
12577,1343,"METHODS: Inbred, female New Zealand Mixed (NZM) 2758 strain of mice were injected with alum."
12578,1343,Control mice were treated similarly with PBS.
12579,1343,The mice were monitored for salivary gland dysfunction by measuring pilocarpine-induced salivation.
12580,1343,Presence of lymphocytic infiltrates within the submandibular glands was studied by histopathology.
12581,1343,Autoantibodies to Ro and La proteins were analysed by ELISA and the presence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) was analysed by indirect immunofluorescence.
12582,1343,"RESULTS: By eight weeks after treatment, the saliva production in the alum-treated mice was significantly decreased in comparison to the PBS-treated mice."
12583,1343,This functional loss persisted till the termination of experiments at 20 wks.
12584,1343,The incidence and severity of sialoadenitis was significantly higher in the alum-treated mice.
12585,1343,"Although there were no differences in the levels of anti-Ro/La autoantibodies in sera of alum and PBS-treated groups, the alum group showed higher ANA reactivity."
12586,1343,"CONCLUSIONS: In the NZM2758 mice, alum induces a Sjgren's syndrome-like disorder that is characterised by chronic salivary gland dysfunction and the presence of lymphocytic infiltrates within the salivary glands."
12587,1343,"Thus, the potential of aluminum-based adjuvants for induction of autoimmunity should be closely monitored in individuals genetically susceptible to developing autoimmune disorders."
12588,1344,"A presentation of postpartum polydipsia and polyuria followed by periodic weakness led to the diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypokalaemic paralysis, both of which are complications of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
12589,1344,The clinically dominant pSS was taken to coexist with long-latent systemic lupus erythematosus and asymptomatic autoimmune thyroid disease.
12590,1344,This case of multiple autoimmune syndrome is a distinctive subgroup of autoimmune disorders that is increasingly recognized.
12591,1344,Female hormone levels appeared to play a role in disease pathogenesis in this case.
12592,1344,The patient was predicted to have a favourable prognosis due to the absence of major organ involvement.
12593,1344,"This case revealed an uncommon form of complex polyautoimmune phenomena and should prompt physicians to extend immunological screening, particularly for females with multiple illnesses."
12594,1345,The aim of this study is to describe the clinical features of cerebellar involvement in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
12595,1345,"We retrospectively analyzed the manifestations, treatments, and outcomes in patients with pSS-cerebellar complication in Peking Union Medical College Hospital and cases reported in literature."
12596,1345,Altogether 13 patients were identified.
12597,1345,They were 2 males and 11 females with a mean age at disease onset of 45.214.6years.
12598,1345,"Nine (69.2%) patients went to the clinic because of ataxia, and pSS was not suspected until accidental screening for autoantibodies."
12599,1345,"Dysarthria (7, 59.8%), limb tremor (4, 30.8%), and nystagmus (2, 15.4%) were the rest symptoms related to cerebellum."
12600,1345,"Of the patients, 81.8% (9/11) had abnormal cerebrospinal fluid findings, and 11 patients (84.6%) had cerebellar atrophy in the brain MRI."
12601,1345,"Dry eyes and dry mouth were detected in 9 (69.2%) and 7 (59.8%) patients, while positive objective xerostomia and ocular test in 82.5% (7/8) and 100% (10/10) of the patients, respectively."
12602,1345,Anti-Ro/SSA antibody was positive in 12 (92.3%) and anti-La/SSB in 6 (46.2%) patients.
12603,1345,Glucocorticoids were applied in 12 patients (92.3%).
12604,1345,"Cyclophosphamide (3, 20.1%), mycophenolatemofetil (1, 7.7%), and hydroxychloroquine (4, 30.8%) were chosen as immunosuppressants or anti-inflammatory drug."
12605,1345,"During a median follow-up of 9months (range, 1-18months), 8 (61.5%) patients remained stable, 3 (20.1%) patients were in remission, and 2 (15.4%) patients were in progression."
12606,1345,"Clinical cerebellar complication secondary to pSS was rare, and sometimes pSS was not suspected until accidental screening for autoantibodies."
12607,1345,"Because the onset of cerebellar manifestation is often insidious and rapid deteriorates, early diagnosis and empirical aggressive glucocorticoid treatment is warranted."
12608,1346,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Neuropsychiatric (NP) events are found in patients with rheumatic diseases, commonly in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
12609,1346,The standard nomenclature and case definitions for 19 NPSLE syndromes by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Committee on Research cover a wide range of NP events seen in both SLE and SS.
12610,1346,"Despite advances in the understanding of SLE and SS, NP syndromes continue to pose diagnostic challenges."
12611,1346,Correct attribution of NP events is critical in determining the correct treatment and prognosis.
12612,1346,"Anti-N-methyl-(d)-aspartate receptor subunits NR2A/B (anti-NR2A/B) antibodies have been demonstrated in the sera of SLE and SS patients and have been associated with collective or specific NP syndromes, though not consistently."
12613,1346,Interpretation of anti-NR2A/B antibody data in the medical literature is rendered difficult by small sample size of patient groups.
12614,1346,"By combining different studies to generate a pooled effect size, a meta-analysis can increase the power to detect differences in the presence or absence of NP syndromes."
12615,1346,"Hence, we set out to perform a meta-analysis to assess the association between anti-NR2A/B antibodies and NP syndromes in SLE and SS."
12616,1346,METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed and other databases from inception to June 2016.
12617,1346,We abstracted data relating to anti-NR2A/B antibodies from the identified studies.
12618,1346,The random effects model was used to calculate overall combined odds ratio (OD) with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) to evaluate the relationship between anti-NR2A/B antibodies and NP syndromes in SLE and SS patients with and without NP events.
12619,1346,We also included our own cohort of 57 SLE patients fulfilling the ACR 1997 revised classification criteria and 58 healthy controls (HCs).
12620,1346,"RESULTS: In total, 17 studies with data on anti-NR2A/B antibodies in 2212 SLE patients, 66 SS patients, 99 disease controls (DCs) (e.g."
12621,1346,"antiphospholipid syndrome, myasthenia gravis and autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome I) and 538 HCs were used in this analysis."
12622,1346,Overall pooled prevalence of serum/plasma anti-NR2A/B antibodies was higher in SLE patients [24.6% (95% CI 18.5-32.0%)] and SS patients [19.7% (95% CI 11.8-31.0%)] compared to DCs [14.8% (95% CI 2.2-56.9)] and HCs [7.6% (95% CI 4.6-12.4%)] (p=0.001).
12623,1346,"There was a significantly greater proportion of SLE and SS patients with NP syndromes who demonstrated positivity for serum/plasma anti-NR2A/B antibody [pooled OR=1.607 (95% CI 1.041-2.479), p=0.032] as compared to SLE and SS patients without NP syndromes in 13 studies."
12624,1346,"Usable data for cerebrospinal fluid anti-NR2A/B antibodies were available in only 4 studies [pooled OR=0.831 (95% CI 0.365-1.888), p=0.658]."
12625,1346,"Among the 19 NP syndromes, serum/plasma anti-NR2A/B antibodies were not specifically associated with any NP syndrome, including cognitive dysfunction (p=0.259) and mood disorder (p=0.503)."
12626,1346,Meta-regression identified proportion of anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibody positivity (p=0.009) and SLE Disease Activity Index (p=0.028) as moderators for the heterogeneity of serum/plasma anti-NR2A/B antibodies.
12627,1346,CONCLUSION: Circulating anti-NR2A/B antibody testing has a diagnostic value for NP syndromes in SLE and SS collectively.
12628,1346,"However, the evidence to date suggests that anti-NR2A/B antibody positivity cannot distinguish specific NP syndromes."
12629,1347,"INTRODUCTION: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disorder affecting exocrine glands; however, a subgroup of pSS patients experience systemic extra-glandular involvement leading to a worsening of disease prognosis."
12630,1347,Current therapeutic options are mainly empiric and often translated by other autoimmune diseases.
12631,1347,In the last few years growing evidence suggests that B-cell depletion by rituximab (RTX) is effective also in pSS.
12632,1347,Patients with early active disease appear to be those who could benefit the most from RTX.
12633,1347,The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of RTX in comparison to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in early active pSS patients.
12634,1347,"METHODS: Forty-one patients with early pSS and active disease (EULAR Sjogren's syndrome disease activity index, ESSDAI  6) were enrolled in the study."
12635,1347,Patients were treated with either RTX or DMARDs in two different Rheumatology centers and followed up for 120 weeks.
12636,1347,"Clinical assessment was performed by ESSDAI every 12 weeks up to week 120 and by self-reported global disease activity pain, sicca symptoms and fatigue on visual analogic scales, unstimulated saliva flow and Schirmer's I test at week 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120."
12637,1347,Laboratory assessment was performed every 12 weeks to week 120.
12638,1347,Two labial minor salivary gland (MSG) biopsies were obtained from all patients at the time of inclusion in the study and at week 120.
12639,1347,RESULTS: Our study demonstrated that RTX treatment results in a faster and more pronounced decrease of ESSDAI and other clinical parameters compared to DMARDs treatment.
12640,1347,No adverse events were reported in the two groups.
12641,1347,"We also observed that RTX is able to reduce glandular infiltrate, interfere with B/T compartmentalization and consequently with the formation of ectopic lymphoid structures and germinal center-like structures in pSS-MSGs."
12642,1347,"CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study performed in a large cohort of early active pSS patients for a period of 120 weeks."
12643,1347,"We showed that RTX is a safe and effective agent to be employed in pSS patients with systemic, extra-glandular involvement."
12644,1347,"Furthermore, our data on pSS-MSGs provide additional biological basis to employ RTX in this disease."
12645,1348,"OBJECTIVE: To determine IgG4 levels in a cohort of consecutive patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and other autoimmune diseases and explore whether they associate with distinct clinical, serologic, and histopathologic features."
12646,1348,METHODS: Serum IgG4 levels were measured in 133 primary SS patients and 49 healthy donors (HDs).
12647,1348,Seventy-four lupus and 54 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients served as disease controls.
12648,1348,Immunohistochemical IgG4 analysis was performed in paraffin-embedded minor salivary gland (MSG) tissues.
12649,1348,"RESULTS: Raised IgG4 serum levels (>135 mg/dl) were detected in 10 (7.5%) of 133 primary SS patients (high-IgG4 group), in 8 (10.8%) of 74 lupus patients, in 7 (12.9%) of 54 RA patients, and in 1 (2%) of 49 HDs."
12650,1348,"Compared to the normal-IgG4 (<135 mg/dl) primary SS group, high-IgG4 patients exhibited increased prevalence of IgG4-related features (autoimmune cholangitis, autoimmune pancreatitis, and interstitial nephritis), lower rates of antinuclear antibody positivity, and higher IgG2 and IgE levels."
12651,1348,Positive staining for IgG4+ plasma cells with an IgG4:IgG ratio 40% was detected in 3 of 6 available MSG tissues in the high-IgG4 group.
12652,1348,Criteria of possible or definite IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) were fulfilled by 10 (7.5%) of 133 of our primary SS cohort.
12653,1348,"CONCLUSION: Raised IgG4 serum levels were detected in 7.5% of primary SS patients in association with IgG4RD-reminiscent clinical, serologic, and histopathologic features."
12654,1348,Whether this high-IgG4 primary SS group represents a misclassified IgG4-RD group or a distinct primary SS subtype remains to be further explored in future studies.
12655,1349,AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of persistence of mumps virus and some cells that interact with viral infection in the focus of the autoimmune epithelitis and peripheral blood of Sjgren's syndrome patients in comparison to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and nonautoimmune sicca syndrome (nSS).
12656,1349,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: 126 patients (119 women and 7 men) were grouped into four groups: (1) patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), (2) patients with secondary Sjgren's syndrome due to rheumatoid arthritis (sSS), (3) patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and (4) patients with nonautoimmune sicca syndrome (nSS)."
12657,1349,Immunohistochemical analysis of immune response to the suggested silent persistence of mumps virus in the minor labial salivary gland biopsies and flow cytometric analysis of blood cells was done.
12658,1349,RESULTS: Immunohistochemical signs of mumps virus persistence were found in the minor salivary glands of all study groups.
12659,1349,"Also, a significantly different immune response to virus infection (protein IFI16, interferons gamma and beta, dendritic cells, and receptor for natural killers) was revealed in the minor salivary glands of the study groups."
12660,1349,Cytometric analysis of the blood cells revealed a dropping amount of circulating natural killers and dendritic cells in patients with SS.
12661,1349,Significant correlations between immunohistochemical staining and serological findings were revealed.
12662,1349,CONCLUSIONS: Abundant immunohistochemical signs of mumps virus protein in the salivary glands and depletion of circulating immune cells make a background for thought of presumable mumps or/and other virus participation in epithelial damage causing sicca syndrome in predisposed patients.
12663,1350,This study was designed to investigate whether Foxp3( +) regulatory T (Treg) cells play a role in the histopathologic changes of primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS) and to evaluate other factors possibly associated with Foxp3(+) Treg cells in pSS patients.
12664,1350,"The number of FoxP3-expressing T cells in peripheral blood (PB) of 39 patients with pSS, 40 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 28 healthy controls was measured by flow-cytometer analysis."
12665,1350,FoxP3-expressing CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells were analyzed in minor salivary gland (SG) tissues of 39 pSS patients.
12666,1350,Histopathologic changes were examined by light microscopy according to Chisholm's classification.
12667,1350,Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed to assess the Foxp3(+) Treg in SG biopsy specim-ens.
12668,1350,The numbers of CD4(+) T cells and FoxP3-expressing CD4(+) T cells in PB were similar in all groups.
12669,1350,"Expression of CD25 on CD4(+) T cells in PB of patients with pSS and RA was significantly higher than in healthy controls, especially for RA patients."
12670,1350,"Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence showed that FoxP3(+) Treg were enriched in the SGs of pSS patients, with a positive correlation between the increase in FoxP3(+) Treg in SG and the Chisholm score in pSS (p < 0.001, r = +0.605)."
12671,1350,"The increase of FoxP3( +) Treg cells in the SGs of pSS patients, which is correlated with gland infiltration, suggests that natural regulatory T cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of pSS."
12672,1350,Further studies are required to explore the mechanisms that mediate the relationship between Treg and the pathogenesis of pSS.
12673,1351,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that causes hyposecretion in salivary glands.
12674,1351,Endothelial tight junctions (TJs) play crucial roles in salivation and barrier function of blood vessels.
12675,1351,"However, whether the alteration of endothelial TJs were involved in pathogenesis of SS was still unknown."
12676,1351,"Here, the ultrastructure and function of endothelial TJs in submandibular glands (SMGs) were detected by transmission electron microscopy and in vivo paracellular permeability assay in different aged NOD mouse model for SS."
12677,1351,"CFSE-labeled lymphocytes were injected into tail vein to trace the infiltration, while claudin-5 expression and distribution were detected by immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and western blot."
12678,1351,"Results showed that the stimulated salivary flow rate was gradually decreased and lymphocytic infiltration was found as age increased in 12- and 21-week-old NOD mice, but not 7-week-old NOD mice."
12679,1351,"Blood vessels were dilated, while endothelial TJ width and paracellular tracer transport were increased in 12-week-old NOD mice."
12680,1351,"Moreover, the injected CFSE-labeled lymphocytes were observed in SMGs of 12-week-old NOD mice."
12681,1351,Claudin-5 level was increased and relocalized from the apical portion of neighboring endothelial cells to lateral membranes and cytoplasm in 12-week-old NOD mice.
12682,1351,"Additionally, the alteration of claudin-5 expression and distribution was further confirmed in labial salivary glands and bilateral parotid glands from SS patients."
12683,1351,"In cultured human microvessel endothelial cell line (HMEC-1), IFN- stimulation significantly increased claudin-5 expression."
12684,1351,"Taken together, we identified that the endothelial TJ barrier was disrupted and contributed to the development of salivary hyposecretion and lymphocytic infiltration in SS."
12685,1352,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Histopathologic studies have demonstrated WM damage in primary Sjgren syndrome.
12686,1352,The purpose of this study was to evaluate WM microstructural changes by use of DTI-derived parameters in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome.
12687,1352,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI was performed in 19 patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (age, 64.73  9.1 years; disease duration, 11.5  7.56 years) and 16 age-matched control subjects."
12688,1352,"Exclusion criteria were a history of major metabolic, neurologic, or psychiatric disorder and high risk for cardiovascular disease."
12689,1352,"Data were analyzed by use of tract-based spatial statistics, for which the WM skeleton was created, and a permutation-based inference with 5000 permutations was used with a threshold of P < .01, corrected for multiple comparisons to enable identification of abnormalities in fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity."
12690,1352,"RESULTS: Tract-based spatial statistics showed decreased fractional anisotropy in multiple areas in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome compared with control subjects, located mainly in the corticospinal tract, superior longitudinal fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus."
12691,1352,"Increased mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity and decreased axial diffusivity were observed in most of the fiber tracts of the brain in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome, compared with control subjects."
12692,1352,"CONCLUSIONS: Patients with primary Sjgren syndrome show loss of WM microstructural integrity, probably related to both Wallerian degeneration and demyelination."
12693,1353,The aim of this study was to assess fatigue aspects in Moroccan patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its relationships with disease-specific variables especially parameters of functional and structural severity.
12694,1353,A total of 248 patients with RA were included.
12695,1353,Patients' and disease characteristics were identified.
12696,1353,"Disease activity was measured clinically using physical examination, biologically and by the disease activity scores (DAS28)."
12697,1353,Radiographs were evaluated by using Sharp's method as modified by van der Heijde.
12698,1353,Functional disability was measured by using the Moroccan version of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ).
12699,1353,Immunological abnormalities and treatment (doses and duration) were identified.
12700,1353,Fatigue was evaluated by using a 0-100 visual analogue scale (VAS fatigue) and the multidimensional assessment of fatigue (MAF).
12701,1353,Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the Arabic version of the generic instrument SF-36.
12702,1353,The mean age of patients was 47.5  11.7 years [25-72]; 37.5% of patients had a high activity of disease and 11.3% were in remission.
12703,1353,"The mean Sharp score was 107.13  91, and the mean score of HAQ was 1.40  0.63."
12704,1353,All domains of QoL were deteriorated; 89.51% of our patients experienced fatigue.
12705,1353,The mean total score of MAF was 30.21  11.32.
12706,1353,"A low level of education, low socioeconomic status, atlantoaxial subluxation, hip involvement, the presence of a Sjgren syndrome, and cigarette smoking had a negative impact on fatigue scores."
12707,1353,"The severity of fatigue was correlated with the duration of RA, the intensity of joint pain, the activity of disease, the importance of structural damage, the degree of functional impairment, and the rate of anti-cyclic citrullinated protein (CCP) antibodies (P < 0.05)."
12708,1353,Patients receiving methotrexate had better scores of fatigue.
12709,1353,"Also, severity of fatigue was correlated with the deterioration of all domains of QoL."
12710,1353,Fatigue is a major issue for our patients with RA and must be included in the routine assessment of patients.
12711,1353,"In our sample, fatigue appears to be related to disease activity, functional disability, structural damage, and immunological status and had a negative impact on QoL."
12712,1354,The etiology of salivary gland injury in primary Sjgren's disease is not well understood.
12713,1354,"We have previously described a mouse model of Sjgren's disease, IL-14 transgenic (IL14TG) mice, which reproduces many of the features of the human disease."
12714,1354,We now demonstrate a critical role for lymphotoxin  (LTA) in the pathogenesis of Sjgren's disease in IL14TG mice.
12715,1354,IL14TG mice express LTA mRNA in their salivary glands and spleen and produce soluble LTA protein in their salivary secretions.
12716,1354,"When IL14TG mice were crossed with LTA(-/-) mice, the IL14TG.LTA(-/-) mice retained normal salivary gland secretions and did not develop either lymphocytic infiltration of their salivary glands or secondary lymphomas."
12717,1354,"However, both IL14TG and IL14TG.LTA(-/-) mice produced similar amounts of IFN- and had similar deposition of autoantibodies in their salivary glands."
12718,1354,"Both IL14 and IL14/LTA(-/-) mice had similar B cell responses to T-dependent and T-independent Ags, L-selectin expression, and expression of RelA, RelB, and NF-B2 in their spleens."
12719,1354,These studies suggest that LTA plays a critical role in the local rather than systemic inflammatory process of Sjgren's disease.
12720,1354,"Furthermore, local production of soluble LTA in the salivary glands of IL14TG mice is necessary for the development of overt Sjgren's disease."
12721,1354,Autoantibody deposition alone is not sufficient to produce salivary gland dysfunction.
12722,1354,"We also demonstrate that LTA is increased in the salivary gland secretions and sera of patients with Sjgren's disease, further strengthening the biological relevance of the IL14TG model to understanding the pathogenesis of human disease."
12723,1355,PURPOSE: To investigate the morphological changes of the retina measured with the Cirrus high-definition optical coherence tomography in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
12724,1355,METHODS: One hundred ninety six eyes of 196 patients with pSS and 200 eyes of 200 age and sex-matched normal controls were enrolled.
12725,1355,"Patients with pSS were divided into four subgroups based on their presence of autoantibodies (antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-Ro/SSA, and anti-La/SSB)."
12726,1355,"Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness, macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (mGCIPL) thickness, and optic nerve head parameters were compared between groups."
12727,1355,"RESULTS: Compared with controls, a significant decrease was observed in the average, inferior, and temporal thicknesses of pRNFL and in the minimum, superotemporal, inferonasal, inferior, and inferotemporal thicknesses of mGCIPL of eyes with pSS (all P<0.05)."
12728,1355,"In subgroup analyses, all eyes with positive tested autoantibodies [ANA(+), anti-Ro/SSA(+), anti-La/SSB(+)] showed a significant decrease of mGCIPL thicknesses, except for the superonasal portion, compared with eyes with any positivity for autoantibody (all P<0.05)."
12729,1355,"There was a negative linear relationship between the number of positive autoantibodies and average and inferior pRNFL thicknesses or all mGCIPL parameters, except for the superonasal portion, with a Spearman correlation analysis in patients with pSS (all P<0.05)."
12730,1355,"CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls, eyes with pSS showed thinning of pRNFL and mGCIPL thicknesses."
12731,1355,The degree of thinning correlated with increased numbers of the positive autoantibody.
12732,1356,OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with Sjgren syndrome (SS) so as to seek diagnostic rationales.
12733,1356,"METHODS: Sixty-four PBC patients, 57 SS patients and 93 PBC with SS patients were recruited from Peking Union College Hospital between 2006 and 2009."
12734,1356,"And their clinical, laboratory and pathological data were analyzed."
12735,1356,"RESULTS: The patients of PBC with SS (53  10) years were older than those of PBC (50  11) years (P < 0.05) or SS (48  14) years (P < 0.05) ; Comparing PBC with SS and SS, fever was more in SS (P < 0.05) ;compare with PBC, the positive rates of anti-centromere antibody (ACA) (P < 0.05) and anti-SSA antibody (P < 0.05) increased obviously in PBC with SS."
12736,1356,"Comparing with SS, the positive rate of anti-SSA antibody (P < 0.05) and anti-SSB antibody (P < 0.05) were apparently increased obviously in PBC with SS."
12737,1356,CONCLUSION: PBC with SS is a special subgroup with the characteristic both PBC and SS.
12738,1356,"But it can not differentiate from PBC or SS, Anti-SSA antibody and ACA are helpful for diagnosis of PBC with SS."
12739,1357,The coexistence of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) has been documented.
12740,1357,"However, there is no consensus whether this coexistence should be considered as the same nosological condition or as polyautoimmunity."
12741,1357,"Thus, in this monocentric retrospective study, patients with SS alone (i.e., primary) were compared with patients with SS and AITD."
12742,1357,"In addition, a discussion of previous studies including those about genetic and environmental factors influencing the development of both conditions is presented."
12743,1357,"In our series, all patients with AITD had Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT)."
12744,1357,"No significant differences in age, gender, age of disease onset, and disease duration were found between the two groups."
12745,1357,Lymphadenopathy and urticaria were more frequently registered in patients with SS-HT than in patients with SS alone (p<0.05).
12746,1357,Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies were more frequent in the primary SS group (p=0.01).
12747,1357,SS-HT patients were more likely to report a positive history of smoking (p=0.03).
12748,1357,The clinical expression of SS varies slightly when HT coexists.
12749,1357,"Although both entities share common physiopathological mechanisms as part of the autoimmune tautology, they are nosologically different and their coexistence should be interpreted as polyautoimmunity."
12750,1357,Further studies based on polyautoimmunity would allow establishing a new taxonomy of autoimmune diseases.
12751,1358,"Based on the revised criteria of the American-European Consensus Group, we retrospectively established the diagnosis of primary or secondary Sjgren's syndrome for 202 patients referred to a Sjgren's syndrome clinic."
12752,1358,"Of these, 58 patients and 8 patients fulfilled criteria for primary and secondary Sjgren's syndrome, respectively."
12753,1358,"Of the 58 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome, one (1.7%) had definite autoimmune hepatitis, as defined by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group diagnostic criteria."
12754,1358,One additional symptomatic patient who did not fulfill criteria for primary Sjgren's syndrome had definite autoimmune hepatitis.
12755,1358,None of the patients with secondary Sjgren's syndrome had definite autoimmune hepatitis.
12756,1358,Two (1%) of the 194 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome or clinical symptoms had primary biliary cirrhosis.
12757,1358,These values are lower than those reported by prior studies with smaller patient populations and likely represent a more accurate estimate of the true prevalence of these diseases in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome.
12758,1359,"PURPOSE: To investigate by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) the density of presumed epithelial, presumed goblet, and presumed inflammatory cells in the tarsal conjunctiva of healthy young and older subjects and in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
12759,1359,To evaluate the interobserver variability and to compare the measured densities with known age-related and SS-related changes.
12760,1359,"METHODS: The authors studied 24 eyes of 12 healthy young subjects (8 women, 4 men; average age, 26 years; age range, 21-30 years), 24 eyes of 12 healthy older subjects (10 women, 2 men; average age, 68 years; age range, 67-74 years), and 24 eyes of 12 patients with SS (10 women, 2 men; average age, 62 years; age range, 49-72 years)."
12761,1359,The inferior tarsal conjunctiva of each patient was examined in vivo by LSCM.
12762,1359,The density of the three cell types was independently analyzed by two masked investigators.
12763,1359,"RESULTS: The density of presumed epithelial, presumed goblet, and presumed inflammatory cells was significantly higher in SS patients than in both control groups (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test)."
12764,1359,"The densities for presumed goblet cells calculated by the two investigators were significantly different from one another (P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test) and were not correlated."
12765,1359,"CONCLUSIONS: LSCM is a promising tool that should profoundly change the study of the ocular surface, but it requires accurate standardization before it is used in clinical practice."
12766,1360,PURPOSE: Sjgren's syndrome is a systemic chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that primarily targets the salivary and lacrimal glands (LGs).
12767,1360,"Currently there is no cure; therefore, cell-based regenerative therapy may be a viable option."
12768,1360,LG inflammation is facilitated by extracellular ATP and mediated by the Pannexin-1 (Panx1) membrane channel glycoprotein.
12769,1360,We propose that suppression of inflammation through manipulation of Panx1 activity can stimulate epithelial cell progenitor (EPCP) engraftment.
12770,1360,METHODS: The expression of pannexins in the mouse and human LG was assayed by qRT-PCR and immunostaining.
12771,1360,Acute LG inflammation was induced by interleukin-1 (IL1) injection.
12772,1360,"Prior to EPCP transplantation, IL1-injured or chronically inflamed LGs of thrombospondin-1-null mice (TSP-1-/-) were treated with the Panx1-specific blocking peptide (10panx) or the self-deliverable RNAi (sdRNAi)."
12773,1360,The efficacy of cell engraftment and the area of inflammation were analyzed by microscopy.
12774,1360,RESULTS: Panx1 and Panx2 were detected in the mouse and human LGs.
12775,1360,Panx1 and proinflammatory factors were upregulated during acute inflammation at days 1 to 3 after the IL1 injection.
12776,1360,The analysis of EPCP engraftment demonstrated a significant and reproducible positive correlation between the 10panx peptide or Panx1 sdRNAi treatment and the number of engrafted cells.
12777,1360,"Similarly, treatment of the LG of the TSP-1-/- mouse (mouse model of chronic LG inflammation) by either Panx1 or Caspase-4 (also known as Casp11) sdRNAi showed a significant decrease in expression of proinflammatory markers and the lymphocyte infiltration."
12778,1360,CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that blocking Panx1 and/or Casp4 activities is a beneficial strategy to enhance donor cell engraftment and LG regeneration through the reduction of inflammation.
12779,1361,"Connective tissue disease (CTDs), though rare in childhood, are an important cause of morbidity."
12780,1361,Most of them involve multiple organ systems and are associated with presence of autoantibodies.
12781,1361,"Systemic lupus eryethematosus (SLE) is the most common CTD, the others being Juvenile dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective disease and Sjogren syndrome."
12782,1361,"The clinical presentation of CTD in childhood can range from an acute severe illness mimicking a serious infection, to an insidious onset of disease with gradual accumulation of symptoms and signs over wks to months."
12783,1361,"The presence of multi-system involvement, evidence of inflammation and lack of any obvious cause should alert a clinician to the possibility of CTD."
12784,1361,"Diagnosis is usually clinical and features like malar rash, Raynaud's phenomenon, Gottron's rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers suggest a possibility of CTD."
12785,1361,"Presence of autoantibodies like anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-dsDNA etc."
12786,1361,provide supportive evidence to a diagnosis of CTD.
12787,1361,Most CTDs are treated with immunosuppressive drugs with good success.
12788,1361,Early recognition and prompt treatment results in excellent outcome.
12789,1362,"Sjgren syndrome is a chronic, systemic, and autoimmune disorder that targets exocrine glands by remarkable B cell hyperactivity."
12790,1362,"Eventually, it is associated with extra-glandular clinical manifestations that affect essentially any organ system, including pulmonary involvement."
12791,1362,"Interstitial lung disease is one of the most serious pulmonary complications, and the early diagnosis is essential to initiate a prompt therapy."
12792,1362,"On the other hand, Sjgren syndrome could present concomitantly with several rheumatologic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis."
12793,1362,Pulmonary Langerhans Histiocytosis is a rare clonal proliferative disease characterized by pulmonary involvement by cells phenotypically similar to Langerhans cells.
12794,1362,We describe the case of a nonsmoker 62-year-old woman with Sjgren syndrome who presented concomitantly a Pulmonary Langerhans Histiocytosis mimicking a pulmonary complication of its Sjgren.
12795,1362,"Fortunately, she had a well response to corticosteroids and azathioprine regimen."
12796,1362,The aim of the paper is to emphasize the importance of the good differential diagnosis related to the pulmonary involvement.
12797,1362,"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of these two entities in the literature."
12798,1363,We report the case of a 31-year-old woman who presented with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) associated with Sjgren syndrome and distal renal tubular acidosis.
12799,1363,She was hospitalized because of cervical transverse myelopathy and right optic neuritis.
12800,1363,"She had been clinically diagnosed with Sj6gren syndrome, with a high titer of anti-SS-A antibody (1:500) and anti-SS-B antibody (1:498)."
12801,1363,"She also showed hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and nephrocalcinosis caused by distal renal tubular acidosis associated with Sjgren syndrome."
12802,1363,T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed long lesions extending from the medulla oblongata to the lower thoracic cord.
12803,1363,"In addition, gadolinium-enhanced MRI revealed a right optic nerve lesion in the optic canal."
12804,1363,"High titer of anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody was detected in the patient's serum (1:131,072)."
12805,1363,"A combination therapy comprising steroid pulse therapy and plasmapheresis improved her clinical symptoms, and the administration of oral prednisolone (20 mg/ day) was effective in preventing the recurrence of NMO."
12806,1363,"In patients with myelitis/transverse myelopathy associated with autoimmune disorders such as Sjgren syndrome, examining the titer values of anti-AQP4 antibody is indispensable in determining the appropriate therapy."
12807,1364,An accurate dissection of peripheral blood enumeration is lacking in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
12808,1364,The purpose of this study was to quantify different leucocyte populations in peripheral blood of patients with pSS.
12809,1364,Numbers of specific leucocyte subsets were determined in 86 pSS patients and 74 healthy donors quantifying 21 distinct subtypes by flow cytometry.
12810,1364,Subgroups of pSS patients were stratified based on presence of extraglandular manifestations (EGMs) and SSA/SSB autoantibodies.
12811,1364,"Overall, pSS patients manifested decreased lymphocyte subpopulations compared to healthy donors."
12812,1364,Such decreases were more pronounced in SSA/SSB positive patients and patients with EGM.
12813,1364,"Granulocyte and monocyte subpopulations were increased in pSS patients compared to healthy donors, with the greatest increases in SSA/SSB positive patients."
12814,1364,Unsupervised hierarchal clustering based on cell quantities was used to further subgroup the pSS patients into four clusters.
12815,1364,"One of the clusters characterized by higher concentrations of NKT cells, CD56hi NK cells, CD20(+) CD38(-) B cells and CD8(+) CD38(-) T cells was associated with weaker clinical symptoms than the other clusters, possibly marking a milder disease phenotype."
12816,1364,"In conclusion, our analyses indicate significant alterations in the cellular profiles of peripheral blood leucocytes in patients with pSS and may help to stratify the patients according to disease severity."
12817,1365,Objective: To summarize the neurological manifestations in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
12818,1365,"Methods: A total of 68 patients were diagnosed as pSS in neurology department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from March 2014 to February 2018, among whom sixteen cases were excluded due to modified final diagnoses of primary neurological diseases."
12819,1365,Therefore 52 pSS patients with neurological involvement were enrolled and retrospectively analyzed.
12820,1365,"They were divided into two groups as extensive group in which both central and peripheral nervous system were involved, non-extensive group in which either central or peripheral nervous system was involved."
12821,1365,"Results: Neurological manifestations were presented as primary symptoms in 98.1%(51/52) patients, while 35 had neurological involvement as their only extraglandular manifestations."
12822,1365,Thirteen cases were in extensive group.
12823,1365,The other 39 in non-extensive group including 22 cases with only peripheral nervous system involved and 17 cases with only single central nervous system involved.
12824,1365,"Compared to non-extensive group, the proportion of woman patients [13/13 vs.71.8% (28/39), P=0.047], serum IgG level [17.73(11.11,22.41)g/L vs. 11.49(9.58,13.40)g/L, P=0.017] and positive rates of oligoclonal band (OB) in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) [7/13 vs. 22.6%(7/31), P=0.042)] were significantly higher in extensive involvement group."
12825,1365,"Conclusions: Neurological manifestations in pSS patients could be extensive, both central and peripheral nervous system might be associated."
12826,1365,"Female patients, high serum IgG level and positive OB in CSF are risk factors of extensive neurological involvement, suggesting that the immune system may be generally over-stimulated."
12827,1366,"OBJECTIVE: This study sets out to investigate the relationship between health status [EuroQol five-dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D)] in primary SS and three of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) SS outcome measures-the disease activity index (ESSDAI), the patient reported index (ESSPRI) and the sicca score."
12828,1366,"In particular, the goal was to establish whether there is a relationship between the EULAR outcome measures and quality of life."
12829,1366,METHODS: Health status was evaluated using a standardized measure developed by the EuroQol Group-the EQ5D.
12830,1366,This permits calculation of two measures of health status: time trade-off (TTO) values and the EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) scores.
12831,1366,We used Spearman's rank correlation analysis to investigate the strength of association between health status and three EULAR measures of physician- and patient-reported disease activity in 639 patients from the UK primary SS registry (UKPSSR) cohort.
12832,1366,RESULTS: This study demonstrates that the EULAR SS disease-specific outcome measures are significantly correlated with health outcome values (P < 0.001).
12833,1366,"Higher scores on the ESSDAI, EULAR sicca score and ESSPRI are associated with poorer health states-i.e."
12834,1366,lower TTO values and lower VAS scores.
12835,1366,"While all three are significantly correlated with TTO values and EQ-5D VAS scores, the effect is strongest for the ESSPRI."
12836,1366,"CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence supporting the use of ESSDAI, EULAR sicca score and ESSPRI measures in the clinic."
12837,1366,We also discuss the need for disease-specific measures of health status and their comparison with standardized health outcome measures.
12838,1367,"AIMS: Growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) is a vitamin K-dependent protein expressed by endothelial cells and leukocytes that are involved in cell survival, migration, and proliferation in response to inflammatory processes."
12839,1367,The aim of this study was to assess the implications of Gas6 in Sjgren syndrome (SS) and its expression in the labial salivary gland.
12840,1367,"METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 254 adults, including 159 with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS), 34 with secondary Sjgren syndrome (sSS), and 61 normal controls, were recruited."
12841,1367,"Plasma Gas6 concentrations were determined, and Gas6 expressions in labial salivary gland (LSG) tissues from controls and pSS and sSS patients were also evaluated."
12842,1367,"Plasma Gas6 concentrations were significantly lower among patients with pSS than normal controls (13.5  8.6 vs. 19.9  13.4 ng/ml, p < 0.001)."
12843,1367,"There were, however, no significant differences in plasma Gas6 levels between pSS and sSS patients (13.5  8.6 vs. 16.9  11.2 ng/ml, p = 0.068)."
12844,1367,"In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjustment for white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, platelet count, lymphocyte count, and C3 and C4 levels, lower plasma Gas6 concentrations were significantly associated with an increased risk of SS."
12845,1367,"Moreover, by using a semi-quantitative scale to evaluate Gas6 expression in LSG tissues, Gas6 expression was found to be markedly lower in LSG tissues from pSS patients than in tissues from normal controls."
12846,1367,CONCLUSIONS: Decreased plasma Gas6 concentration and LSG expression were associated with pSS.
12847,1367,"As such, Gas6 may represent a novel independent risk factor for pSS, with a potential role in salivary gland inflammation and dysfunction."
12848,1368,OBJECTIVE: This systematic review evaluated the efficacy of immunobiologics for the management of oral disease in Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
12849,1368,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE() , Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched for evidence on the use of immunobiologics for management of glandular disease in SS."
12850,1368,"Primary outcomes were xerostomia and salivary gland dysfunction, assessed via visual analogue scales, disease-specific scales for SS, measurement of salivary flow, ultrasound data, and quality of life measures."
12851,1368,RESULTS: Seventeen studies (11 randomized controlled trials and 6 observational studies) met inclusion criteria.
12852,1368,Rituximab showed efficacy in improving salivary gland function but not xerostomia.
12853,1368,Abatacept showed promise in improving both xerostomia and salivary flow.
12854,1368,Belimumab exhibited long-term improvement of salivary flow and subjective measures.
12855,1368,The novel agent CFZ533 improved both disease activity and patient-reported indexes.
12856,1368,CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence pointing to the efficacy of rituximab in the management of oral disease in SS.
12857,1368,Future controlled trials may elucidate the efficacy of belimumab and abatacept.
12858,1368,The new drug CFZ533 is a promising alternative for the management of SS and its salivary gland involvement.
12859,1368,"In considering these agents, the promise of efficacy must be balanced against the harmful effects associated with biologic agents."
12860,1369,"Within the past 10 years, the use of saliva as a diagnostic tool has gained considerable attention and become a well-accepted method."
12861,1369,"As a diagnostic fluid, saliva offers superiority over serum due to both a noninvasive collection method by specially trained persons and a cost-effective approach for screening of large populations."
12862,1369,Collection of saliva offers a reduced risk of infection compared to the collection of serum.
12863,1369,"Moreover, obtaining saliva samples from infant, disabled or anxious patients, is much easier than obtaining other samples."
12864,1369,There is a lot of useful components-changing information in saliva when a person is in sick.
12865,1369,"Therefore, we define these changing components as ""biomarkers""."
12866,1369,"The utilization of biomarkers as early predictors for clinical disease not only contributes to the effective prevention and treatment of diseases, but also enhances the assessment of potential health risks."
12867,1369,"In this article, we have reviewed the properties of saliva, the salivary analysis method for biomarker discovery, and the diagnostic potentials of salivary biomarkers in monitoring and detecting periodontal disease, Oral and Breast cancers, and Sjgren's syndrome."
12868,1369,We also discussed some barriers of applications of saliva as a diagnostic media as well as recent improvements.
12869,1369,We also prospected the future processing directions of using biomarkers in disease diagnosis and draw a conclusion that saliva is indeed an effective media in various disease monitoring and diagnosis.
12870,1370,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is characterized by mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates and IgG plasma cells in salivary and lacrimal glands which lead to irreversible destruction of the glandular tissue and is accompanied by sensation of dryness of mouth and eyes.
12871,1370,B cells play a central role in the immunopathogenesis and exhibit signs of hyperactivity.
12872,1370,"Hyperactivity of B cells is the consequence of the coordinated and integrated action of stimulation of the B-cell receptor, CD40 and toll-like receptors in the presence of appropriate cytokines."
12873,1370,"As discussed, overexpression of type I IFN and BAFF on one hand and IL-6 and IL-21 on the other hand are critically involved in the enhanced plasma cell formation in pSS patients."
12874,1370,Hyperactivity of B cells results in secretion of autoantibodies and production of various cytokines.
12875,1370,These insights in the role of B cells in the pathogenetic process of pSS offer ample targets for successful therapeutical intervention in pSS.
12876,1371,Large epidemiological studies have shown a consistent increased risk for developing lymphoma in the setting of autoimmune disorders (AID).
12877,1371,It is known that this link appears to be stronger for some AID and certain non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes e.g.
12878,1371,"Sjgren's syndrome and extra-nodal marginal zone lymphoma of the salivary gland, and thyroid MALT lymphoma in a background of Hashimoto's thyroiditis."
12879,1371,B and T-cell hyperactivity due to chronic antigenic stimulation and the consequent presence of acquired lymphoid tissue seems to play a key role in the pathogenesis of AI-related lymphomas.
12880,1371,"Advanced age at diagnosis, prolonged disease course and disease severity are thought to increase the risk of lymphoma development in AID patients."
12881,1371,There is increasing evidence that AI-related lymphomas constitute a different spectrum of entities indicating a different pathobiology with specific clinical features and treatment implications.
12882,1371,This chapter will provide a general overview on the epidemiological aspects of the NHL-AID association focussing on marginal zone lymphomas - one of the NHL subtypes mostly implicated in the synchronous/metachronous association with AID.
12883,1371,We will review the possible biological mechanisms involved and the risk factors in each autoimmune condition related to this lymphoma.
12884,1372,We report an unusual case of disseminated discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) complicated by pre-existing atopic dermatitis (AD) and late-onset Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
12885,1372,"Disseminated DLE lesions were sparse on the expected sites for AD, such as the medial region of the extremities or v-neck area."
12886,1372,The patient fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for AD and SS but not for systemic lupus erythematosus.
12887,1372,Histopathological analysis of the crusted erythematous lesions revealed typical DLE with few FoxP3(+) cells and a moderate number of IL-17(+) cells.
12888,1372,A quantitative sweating test showed impaired sweating of both lesional and non-lesional skin due to underlying hypohidrosis that was related to AD and SS.
12889,1372,This finding suggests that dissemination of DLE was triggered by scratching and a Kbner phenomenon-like effect related to hypohidrotic and xerotic skin.
12890,1372,"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of disseminated DLE complicated by AD and SS."
12891,1373,Antibody to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) early antigen diffuse (anti-EA-D) is associated with viral replication.
12892,1373,"However, their possible associations with clinical/therapeutic features in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) were not established."
12893,1373,We evaluated 100 pSS patients (American-European Criteria) and 89 age/gender/ethnicity-matched healthy controls.
12894,1373,Disease activity was measured by EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI).
12895,1373,"Antibodies to EBV (anti-VCA IgG/IgM, anti-EBNA-1 IgG, anti-EA-D IgG) were determined by ELISA."
12896,1373,"Patients and controls had comparable frequencies and mean levels of anti-VCA IgG (90 vs. 86.5 %, p = 0.501; 2.6  1.1 vs. 2.5  1.1 AU/mL, p = 0.737) and anti-EBNA-1 IgG (92 vs. 94.4 %, p = 0.576; 141.3  69.8 vs. 135.6  67.5 RU/mL, p = 0.464)."
12897,1373,Anti-VCA IgM was negative in all cases.
12898,1373,"Noteworthy, higher frequency and increased mean levels of anti-EA-D were observed in patients than controls (36 vs. 4.5 %, p < 0.0001; 38.6  57.4 vs. 7.9  26.3 RU/mL, p < 0.0001)."
12899,1373,"Further analysis of patients with (n = 36) and without (n = 64) anti-EA-D revealed comparable age/gender/ethnicity (p  0.551), current prednisone dose (4.8  6.9 vs. 5.1  10.4 mg/day, p = 0.319), and current uses of prednisone (52.8 vs. 37.5 %, p = 0.148) and immunosuppressants (44.4 vs. 31.3 %, p = 0.201)."
12900,1373,"ESSDAI values were comparable (p = 0.102), but joint activity was more frequent (25 vs. 9.4 %, p = 0.045) in anti-EA-D positive patients."
12901,1373,"Anti-EA-D antibodies were not associated with anti-Ro/SSA (p = 1.000), anti-La/SSB (p = 0.652), rheumatoid factor (p = 1.000), anti--fodrin (p = 0.390) or antiphospholipid antibodies (p = 0.573), not suggesting cross-reactivity."
12902,1373,The higher anti-EA-D frequency associated with joint activity raises the possibility that a subclinical EBV reactivation may trigger or perpetuate the articular involvement in pSS.
12903,1374,OBJECTIVE: Disorganization of acinar cell apical microvilli and the presence of stromal collagen in the acinar lumen suggest that the labial salivary gland (LSG) barrier function is impaired in patients with Sjgren's syndrome.
12904,1374,"Tight junctions define cell polarity and regulate the paracellular flow of ions and water, crucial functions of acinar cells."
12905,1374,This study was undertaken to evaluate the expression and localization of tight junction proteins in LSGs from patients with SS and to determine in vitro the effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) on tight junction integrity of isolated acini from control subjects.
12906,1374,METHODS: Twenty-two patients and 15 controls were studied.
12907,1374,"The messenger RNA and protein levels of tight junction components (claudin-1, claudin-3, claudin-4, occludin, and ZO-1) were determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting."
12908,1374,Tight junction protein localization was determined by immunohistochemistry.
12909,1374,Tight junction ultrastructure was examined by transmission electron microscopy.
12910,1374,Isolated acini from control subjects were treated with TNFalpha and IFNgamma.
12911,1374,RESULTS: Significant differences in tight junction protein levels were detected in patients with SS.
12912,1374,"ZO-1 and occludin were strongly down-regulated, while claudin-1 and claudin-4 were overexpressed."
12913,1374,Tight junction proteins localized exclusively to apical domains in acini and ducts of LSGs from controls.
12914,1374,"In SS patients, the ZO-1 and occludin the apical domain presence of decreased, while claudin-3 and claudin-4 was redistributed to the basolateral plasma membrane."
12915,1374,Exposure of isolated control acini to TNFalpha and IFNgamma reproduced these alterations in vitro.
12916,1374,Ultrastructural analysis associated tight junction disorganization with the presence of endocytic vesicles containing electron-dense material that may represent tight junction components.
12917,1374,"CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that local cytokine production in LSGs from SS patients may contribute to the secretory gland dysfunction observed in SS patients by altering tight junction integrity of epithelial cells, thereby decreasing the quality and quantity of saliva."
12918,1375,"OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate ClinESSDAI (Clinical European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index), ie, ESSDAI without the biological domain."
12919,1375,PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 702 fictive vignettes derived from 96 real cases of primary Sjgren's syndrome of the ESSDAI development study were used.
12920,1375,"As for ESSDAI development, the physician assessment of disease activity (0-10 scale) was used as the 'gold standard' in a multivariate model for weighting domains, after removing the biological domain."
12921,1375,"The reliability, assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between ClinESSDAI and ESSDAI, explored if ClinESSDAI was equivalent to ESSDAI."
12922,1375,"Its psychometric (ie, measurement) properties were compared with that of ESSDAI in an independent cohort."
12923,1375,"Also, its use was evaluated on data of two clinical trials."
12924,1375,"RESULTS: In multivariate modelling, all 11 domains remained significantly associated with disease activity, with slight modifications of some domain weights."
12925,1375,Reliability between clinESSDAI and ESSDAI was excellent (ICC=0.98 and 0.99).
12926,1375,"Psychometric properties of clinESSDAI, disease activity levels and minimal clinically important improvement thresholds and its ability to detect change over time in clinical trials were very close to that of ESSDAI."
12927,1375,CONCLUSIONS: ClinESSDAI appears valid and very close to the original ESSDAI.
12928,1375,This score provides an accurate evaluation of disease activity independent of B-cell biomarkers.
12929,1375,"It could be used in various circumstances: (i) in biological/clinical studies to avoid data collinearity, (ii) in clinical trials, as secondary endpoint, to detect change independent of biological effect of the drug, (iii) in clinical practice to assess disease activity for visits where immunological tests have not been done."
12930,1376,T cells are implicated in both local and systemic pathophysiology of primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS).
12931,1376,"Lymphocytic infiltrates in exocrine glands are dominated by CD4+ T cells, some contributing to ectopic lymphoid tissue, others, unusually, exhibiting cytotoxic potential."
12932,1376,"Cytokine secretion patterns are complex, with Th1 and Th17 components implicated in pathology."
12933,1376,"Circulating T cells exhibit phenotypes consistent with hyperactivation, cytokine imbalance, and homeostatic alterations; CD4 lymphopenia is recognized as a risk factor for developing lymphoma."
12934,1376,Evidence of oligoclonal expansion is found locally and systemically.
12935,1376,Functional alterations (e.g.
12936,1376,"cytokine secretion profile, migratory potential, target cell interactions) are less clearly defined."
12937,1376,"Attempts at T cell-targeted therapy of PSS have been limited, although therapy targeted at other arms of the immune response may also affect T cells."
12938,1376,"A better understanding of T-cell dysregulation in PSS is required in order to understand its contribution to disease, aid prognosis, and improve therapeutic interventions aimed at this aspect of the disease."
12939,1377,We report a 62-year-old woman with a history of Basedow's disease and Sjogren's syndrome who presented with slowly progressive limb muscle weakness over the course of ten years.
12940,1377,"On physical examination, she had dry eye and mouth, but was otherwise normal."
12941,1377,Neurological examination revealed symmetrical proximal dominant muscle weakness.
12942,1377,"Polymyositis was suspected at initial diagnosis due to her clinical course, physical examination, and autoimmune disease."
12943,1377,"However, the final diagnosis based on a muscle biopsy was the chronic myopathic type of sarcoid myopathy."
12944,1377,"Among 25 definite sarcoid myopathy cases in the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry muscle repository from 2010 to 2015, 6/25 had autoimmune diseases."
12945,1377,All 6 patients were female and had the chronic myopathic type of sarcoid myopathy.
12946,1377,"The number of patients with Sjogren's syndrome, thyroid disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and idiopathic thrombocytopenia were 4, 1, 1, and 1, respectively."
12947,1377,Only the present case had both thyroid disease and Sjogren's syndrome.
12948,1377,"In conclusion, the chronic myopathic type of sarcoid myopathy is one possibility to consider in patients who present with progressive myopathy together with autoimmune diseases."
12949,1378,"Xerostomia is a general term used to refer to dryness of oral mucosa, and is distinguished from a sense of thirst."
12950,1378,"Causes of xerostomia with a decrease in saliva which bears calcium metabolism such as recalcification of enamel canes include ; age-related atrophy of salivary gland, Sjgren's syndrome, salivary gland disorder due to radiation therapy, side effect of medication, and autonomic nervous system imbalance, dehydration."
12951,1378,Xerostomia without decrease in saliva production but shows excessive evaporation of saliva could be due to mouth-breathing.
12952,1378,"Symptoms of xerostomia include ; burning sensation in the mouth, poor oral hygiene, inflammatory change of oral mucosa, high incidence of periodontal disease or caries, and impairment of oral function (dysphagia, dysgeusia, and speech disorder) ."
12953,1378,This article discusses about xerostomia and dysphagia.
12954,1379,"INTRODUCTION: In this study, we sought to address changes in blood lymphocyte subpopulations and labial salivary gland (LSG) inflammation after belimumab treatment in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and to identify predictors of response to treatment."
12955,1379,METHODS: Sequential blood lymphocyte subsets and LSG biopsies were analysed between week 0 (W0) and W28 in 15 patients with pSS treated with belimumab.
12956,1379,Systemic response to treatment was defined as a decrease in the European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index score of 3 points at W28.
12957,1379,"RESULTS: After belimumab, we observed a decrease in blood B lymphocytes primarily involving CD27-negative/immunoglobulin D-positive nave B cells (p=0.008)."
12958,1379,Lymphocytic sialadenitis (focus score >1) that was present in 12 patients (80.0 %) before belimumab treatment became negative in 5 of them after treatment (p=0.03).
12959,1379,The median (interquartile range) LSG B-cell/T-cell ratio decreased from 0.58 (0.5-0.67) to 0.50 (0.5-0.5) (p=0.06).
12960,1379,B-cell activating factor (BAFF) staining was detected in 11 (78.6 %) of 14 patients before belimumab treatment compared with 7 (50.0 %) of 14 after belimumab therapy (p=0.10).
12961,1379,The median percentage of BAFF-positive cells in foci significantly decreased from 27.5 % (10-40) to 5 % (0-20) (p=0.03).
12962,1379,A systemic response was achieved in six patients (40 %).
12963,1379,"The only predictor of response was the presence of a low number of natural killer (NK) cells, both in blood (8.5 % [7-10] vs 11 % [9-21]; p=0.04) and in LSG (20.6/mm(3) [20.0-21.4] vs 30.0/mm(3) [25.0-100.0], p=0.003)."
12964,1379,Serum BAFF levels did not influence response to treatment.
12965,1379,CONCLUSIONS: Low blood and salivary NK cell numbers are associated with a better response to belimumab.
12966,1379,"This suggests that two distinct subsets of pSS may exist: one with a predominant type I interferon (IFN)-BAFF-B-cell axis, representing good responders to belimumab; and one with a predominant type II IFN-NK cell axis, representing non-responders."
12967,1379,TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01160666 .
12968,1379,Registered 9 July 2010.
12969,1380,"AIM: To investigate the T-helper (Th1, Th2 and Th17) cell activity in the peripheral blood of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), non-Sjgren's sicca syndrome (nSS) and healthy controls."
12970,1380,"PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 34 pSS, 13 nSS patients and 13 healthy controls were stimulated, labeled for cluster of differentiation-4 (CD4), interferon- (IFN-), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-17A and analyzed by flow cytometry."
12971,1380,RESULTS: The activities of Th1 and Th17 cells in patients with pSS were similar to those of the control group.
12972,1380,"The percentage of both IFN-- and IL-17-producing Th17/Th1-like cells was significantly higher in the pSS, as compared to the control group, whereas that of Th2 cells was lower."
12973,1380,A significant correlation was found between all Th-subset activities in the control group.
12974,1380,"However, in the pSS group, a correlation was found only between Th1 with Th2 and Th17 and Th17 with Th17/Th1-like."
12975,1380,CONCLUSION: The imbalance in Th-subset activities in peripheral blood may play a role in the pathogenesis of pSS.
12976,1381,"BACKGROUND: Sjgren syndrome (SS) is one of the most common autoimmune disorders that classically affects exocrine glands, resulting in keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia, and frequently is associated with other systemic symptoms."
12977,1381,SS appears to have a particular predilection for involving the autonomic nervous system.
12978,1381,STUDY QUESTION: Does immunotherapy improve signs and symptoms of autonomic nervous system impairment in SS?
12979,1381,STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective review of patients seen in the autonomic clinic at our institution who underwent an evaluation for a suspected autonomic disorder that ultimately was attributed to SS.
12980,1381,SS patients who were treated with immunotherapy and completed autonomic testing before and after treatment were included in this review.
12981,1381,RESULTS: A total of 4 patients were identified who were treated for SS-related autonomic dysfunction with immunotherapy and underwent repeat autonomic testing after treatment.
12982,1381,Marked clinical and functional improvement was seen after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin in all patients and adjunctive rituximab therapy in 1 patient.
12983,1381,The clinical improvement with immunotherapy in these patients correlated with markedly improved findings on autonomic testing in all.
12984,1381,MEASURES AND OUTCOMES: Clinical symptoms and results of autonomic testing prior to and following immunotherapy were assessed.
12985,1381,"CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic signs and symptoms in SS are potentially immunoresponsive, but immunotherapy in these patients may require repeated, ongoing, or adjunctive therapy for optimal and sustained improvement."
12986,1382,A 74-year-old man presented with a progressive decrease in visual acuity and foreign body sensation in his right eye 8days post uncomplicated phacoemulsification cataract surgery and intraocular lens insertion.
12987,1382,"The patient had been placed on a perioperative cataract regimen which consisted of G. Maxitrol (dexamethasone, polymyxin B sulfate, neomycin sulfate) four times a day and G. Yellox twice daily (bromfenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) for 2weeks."
12988,1382,"On examination, he had a corneal ulcer and stromal thinning in his right eye which progressed to a full thickness perforation 12 hours later."
12989,1382,The patient required a full thickness tectonic corneal transplant.
12990,1382,Direct questioning revealed that this patient had both dry mouth and eyes.
12991,1382,Serology revealed that the patient was positive for rheumatoid factor and for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies.
12992,1382,A parotid gland biopsy revealed significant lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with Sjgren's syndrome.
12993,1383,Celiac disease (CD) is an immune mediated enteropathy with an increasing prevalence worldwide.
12994,1383,It is estimated that 1% of general population in Europe is suffering from this ailment.
12995,1383,The clinically silent form affects the majority of patients.
12996,1383,"Hence, diarrhea, nutritional deficiencies and weight loss are symptoms which are not very often seen."
12997,1383,Nonspecific complaints like headaches and joint pain have the potential to delay the diagnosis.
12998,1383,"The high risk groups have been identified to be those patients suffering from autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, Sjogren's syndrome and the first degree relatives of CD patients."
12999,1383,Those patients should be screened for CD.
13000,1383,The association of CD with several autoimmune ailments has various explanations ranging from common genotypes to systemic immune reactions triggered by food antigens.
13001,1383,"CD is, nevertheless, an autoimmune disorder triggered by an environmental antigen (gluten) but, as opposed to other autoimmune disorders in which the pathogenic process is self-sustained, the removal of gluten from diet results in relatively fast resolution of histological and serological markers."
13002,1384,"Sjgren syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that involves primarily the exocrine glands, resulting in their functional impairment."
13003,1384,SS typically presents as dry eyes (xerophthalmia) and dry mouth (xerostomia).
13004,1384,"This process can manifest either as the independent phenomenon of primary SS or as secondary SS when found in the context of another autoimmune process, most commonly rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus."
13005,1384,"Nearly half of the patients with SS develop cutaneous manifestations, which may include dry skin (xeroderma), palpable and nonpalpable purpura, and/or urticaria-like lesions."
13006,1384,These cutaneous manifestations have been underemphasized because they are often overshadowed by the more prominent sicca symptoms.
13007,1384,"However, certain skin findings are of paramount clinical and prognostic importance as they confer an increased risk for the development of life-threatening conditions, including multisystem vasculitis and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.OBJECTIVE AND CONCLUSIONS:In this review, the cutaneous manifestations of primary SS are discussed, with an emphasis on those findings that portend an increased risk of mortality."
13008,1385,"Conventionnal therapy (moisturizers, pilocarpine, Cevimeline, local Cyclosporine, and hydroxychloroquine) remains the basis for the treatment of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) but they do not modify the course of the disease."
13009,1385,Rituximab is currently the most fully evaluated biologics in pSS.
13010,1385,"Open-label studies suggest that Rituximab is well tolerated (although infusion-related reactions and serum sickness remain possible), induces a rapid depletion of B cells in the blood and salivary glands, and could improve early active pSS or pSS with active extra glandular involvement."
13011,1385,"Two small double blind randomized studies have been conducted and now published, demonstrating its efficacy on fatigue and sicca syndrome in early disease."
13012,1385,"Two large double blind studies are currently ongoing or planned: The TEARS study (Tolerance and EfficAcy of Rituximab in primary Sjgren syndrome) in France, is currently including 120 patients having either a recent and active disease and/or at least one extraglandular severe signs."
13013,1385,"The 'TRACTISS' Study (Anti-B-Cell Therapy In Patients With Primary Sjgren's Syndrome), in UK, will include 100 patients having anti-Ro/La antibodies, reduced basal secretion but an increased salivary flow with stimulation, within 10years of diagnosis, symptomatic oral dryness, fatigue and at least one systemic feature."
13014,1386,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a solitary poorly understood autoimmune inflammatory disease by involvement of the salivary and lacrimal glands resulting in dry mouth and dry eyes.
13015,1386,Myoepithelial cells (MECs) are cells knowing for its hybrid epithelial and mesenchymal phenotype that are important components of the salivary gland (SGs) structure aiding the expulsion of saliva from acinar lobules.
13016,1386,"In this study we investigate possible alteration in the myofilament component of MECs in SGs specimens obtained from pSS patients in comparison with healthy subjects, to evaluate MECs hypothetical involvement in the pathogenesis of pSS."
13017,1386,"The expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and p63, as MECs markers, was evaluated in bioptic specimens from pSS and healthy labial SGs through immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses; the distribution of MECs markers was quantified using Aperio ScanScope and ImageScope software to provide quantitative assessments of staining levels."
13018,1386,"Our observations demonstrated that p63 nuclear labeling in pSS MECs is preserved whereas -SMA cytoplasmic staining is strongly and significantly reduced when compared with healthy SGs; the digital images analysis quantification of the expression of labeled -SMA and p63 protein in the healthy and pSS MECs salivary tissues, led to results suggesting a loss of mechanical support for acini and ducts in pSS, correlated, probably, with the reduction of salivary flow that features one important aspect of pSS disease."
13019,1387,OBJECTIVES: To validate the two recently developed disease activity indexes for assessment of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS): the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) SS Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) and the EULAR SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI).
13020,1387,METHODS: A prospective international 6-month duration validation study was conducted in 15 countries.
13021,1387,"At each visit, physicians completed ESSDAI, SS disease activity index (SSDAI), Sjgren's Systemic Clinical Activity Index (SCAI) and physician global assessment (PhGA); and patients completed ESSPRI, Sicca Symptoms Inventory (SSI), Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort (PROFAD) and patient global assessment (PGA)."
13022,1387,"Psychometric properties (construct validity, responsiveness and reliability) were evaluated and compared between scores."
13023,1387,"RESULTS: Of the 395 patients included, 145 (37%) and 251 (64%) had currently active or current or past systemic manifestations, respectively."
13024,1387,EULAR scores had higher correlation with the gold standard than other scores (ESSDAI with PhGA: r=0.59; ESSRPI with PGA: r=0.70).
13025,1387,Correlations between patient and systemic scores were very low (ranging from 0.07 to 0.29).
13026,1387,All systemic scores had similar large responsiveness in improved patients.
13027,1387,Responsiveness of patient scores was low but was significantly higher for ESSPRI compared with SSI and PROFAD.
13028,1387,Reliability was very good for all scores.
13029,1387,CONCLUSIONS: ESSDAI and ESSPRI had good construct validity.
13030,1387,All scores were reliable.
13031,1387,Systemic scores had a large sensitivity to change in patients whose disease activity improves.
13032,1387,"Patient scores had a small sensitivity to change, however, significantly better for ESSPRI."
13033,1387,"Systemic and patient scores poorly correlated, suggesting that they are 2 complementary components that should be both evaluated, but separately."
13034,1388,"IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is characterized by lympho-plasmacytic infiltration and fibrosis in multiple organs, accompanied by high serum IgG4 levels."
13035,1388,"Although both IgG4-RD and Sjgren's syndrome (SS) frequently affect salivary and lacrimal glands, the clinical and pathological features of these two conditions are different."
13036,1388,"In an attempt to delineate the pathomechanisms of IgG4-RD, we compared the gene expression patterns of various molecules in labial salivary glands (LSGs) between IgG4-RD and SS."
13037,1388,"First, using quantitative PCR, we demonstrated significantly higher mRNA expression levels of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), IL-10, and TGF in LSGs of IgG4-RD than SS and healthy controls (HCs)."
13038,1388,"We propose that the combination of AID and IL-10 contributes to IgG4-specific immunoglobulin class switch recombination, and that TGF induces LSGs fibrosis in IgG4-RD."
13039,1388,"Second, DNA microarray identified 2641 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in LSGs; with 1321 up-regulated and 1320 down-regulated genes in IgG4-RD, relative to SS."
13040,1388,"Among the up-regulated DEGs in IgG4-RD, quantitative PCR confirmed significantly higher expression levels of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18 (CCL18) and lactotransferrin in LSGs of IgG4-RD than SS and HCs."
13041,1388,"The former has chemotactic activity on various types of lymphocytes and enhances collagen production from fibroblasts, while lactotransferrin is an iron-binding protein abundantly present in milk and has a wide range of functions, including fibroblast proliferation and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs)."
13042,1388,"Third, immunofluorescence staining confirmed specific upregulation of CCL18 in macrophages, CD11c+and B cells, and plasmacytes of LSGs-IgG4-RD."
13043,1388,These pathological findings could help in the identification of disease-specific biomarkers as well as development of novel therapeutic strategies.
13044,1389,OBJECTIVES: Sjgren syndrome is an autoimmune disease involving mainly salivary and lacrimal glands.
13045,1389,"Beyond widely described PNS involvement, high variable prevalence of CNS manifestations ranging from 2.5 and 60% of all pSS patients has been reported, without specific syndrome definition."
13046,1389,The aim of this cohort study was to evaluate the prevalence of CNS signs and symptoms in pSS patients and to identify possible biomarkers of CNS damage.
13047,1389,METHODS: 120 patients with pSS diagnosis according to the 2002 American-European Consensus Group criteria were enrolled after exclusion of secondary causes.
13048,1389,"All patients underwent to a wide neurological, neuropsychological, psychiatric, neuroradiological and ultrasonographic evaluation."
13049,1389,RESULTS: Central and peripheral nervous system involvement was observed in 81 patients with a prevalence of 67.5%.
13050,1389,The prevalence of CNS involvement was significantly higher than PNS disease (p 0.001).
13051,1389,"68 patients (84%) shown non-focal CNS symptoms and 64 (79%) focal CNS deficits with headache as the most common feature (46.9%), followed by cognitive (44.4%) and mood disorders (38.3%)."
13052,1389,"Particularly, we observed a high prevalence of migraine without aura, subcortical frontal executive functions and verbal memory impairment and apathy/alexythimia."
13053,1389,"MR spectroscopy revealed a reduction of NAA levels or NAA/Cr ratio decrease in subcortical frontal and basal ganglia white matter, while ultrasonography showed an impairment of microvasculature response."
13054,1389,"At multivariate analysis, headache, cognitive disorders and psychiatric symptoms was significantly associated to serological markers (anti-SSA), MRS and ultrasonographic features."
13055,1389,"CONCLUSIONS: The higher prevalence of MWO-mimic headache, cognitive dys-executive syndrome and mood disorders observed in this series confirmed previous evidences of a higher diffused CNS compromission rather than focal involvement such as SM-like clinical course or NMO-like syndrome."
13056,1389,"The association with immunological biomarkers, metabolic cerebral dysfunction and microvascular damage suggests a possible endothelial dysfunction of the cerebral microcirculation or a potential inflammation-mediated shift of the neurovascular coupling."
13057,1390,"Osteopontin (Opn) is a cytokine involved in both physiological and pathological processes, and is elevated in many autoimmune diseases."
13058,1390,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease with a strong female predilection characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands.
13059,1390,We hypothesized that Opn contributes to SS pathogenesis.
13060,1390,We examined an established SS model and found increased Opn locally and systemically.
13061,1390,"Next, we examined Opn transgenic (Opn Tg) mice for evidence of SS."
13062,1390,"Opn Tg animals exhibited lymphocytic infiltration of salivary and lacrimal glands, and Opn co-localized with the infiltrates."
13063,1390,"Moreover, saliva production was reduced, and SS autoantibodies were observed in the serum of these mice."
13064,1390,"Finally, female Opn Tg mice showed more severe disease compared to males."
13065,1390,"Taken together, these data support a role for Opn in SS pathogenesis."
13066,1390,"We identify a new model of spontaneous SS that recapitulates the human disease in terms of sex predilection, histopathology, salivary deficits, and autoantibodies."
13067,1391,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intraoral electrostimulation device, consisting of stimulating electrodes, an electronic circuit, and a power source, in treating xerostomia."
13068,1391,The device delivers electrostimulation through the oral mucosa to the lingual nerve in order to enhance the salivary reflex.
13069,1391,"METHODS: The device was tested on a sample of patients with xerostomia due to Sjgren's syndrome and other sicca conditions in a 2-stage prospective, randomized, multicenter trial."
13070,1391,"Stage I was a double-blind, crossover stage designed to compare the effects of the electrically active device with the sham device, each used for 1 month, and stage II was a 3-month open-label stage designed to assess the long-term effects of the active device."
13071,1391,Improvement in xerostomia severity from baseline was the primary outcome measure.
13072,1391,RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were randomized.
13073,1391,"In stage I, the active device performed better than the sham device for patient-reported xerostomia severity (P<0.002), xerostomia frequency (P<0.05), quality of life impairment (P<0.01), and swallowing difficulty (P<0.02)."
13074,1391,"At the end of stage II, statistically significant improvements were verified for patient-reported xerostomia severity (P<0.0001), xerostomia frequency (P<0.0001), oral discomfort (P<0.001), speech difficulty (P<0.02), sleeping difficulty (P<0.001), and resting salivary flow rate (P<0.01)."
13075,1391,"CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that daily use of the device alleviated oral dryness, discomfort, and some complications of xerostomia, such as speech and sleeping difficulties, and increased salivary output."
13076,1391,"The results show a cumulative positive effect of the device over the period of the study, from baseline to the end of the trial."
13077,1392,Keratoconjunctivitis sicca represents a progressive deterioration of ocular surface produced by a deficient secretion of lachrymal film (quantitative disorder) or excessive tear evaporation (qualitative disorder).
13078,1392,"The cytological analysis of conjunctival impression in 42 patients with dry eye syndrome established a strong correlation between the clinical grade of severity of disease and the grade of squamous metaplasia, including goblet cell loss."
13079,1392,"The cellular anomalies were represented by modifications of keratinization, epithelial cells' anisocytosis, anisochromia, the nuclear condensation and the cytoplasmic vacuolization."
13080,1392,Pyknotic nuclei and anucleated cells were only seen in the most severe dry eye.
13081,1392,"The modifications in epithelial cells and conjunctival goblet cells reveal cellular sufferance, with an evident parallelism between these anomalies and clinico-functional signs in dry eye."
13082,1392,"Conjunctival impression provides an easy and quick identification of the lachrymal film alterations with high specificity and sensitivity, giving valuable information about the qualitative disorder."
13083,1393,OBJECTIVES: Development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is the major adverse outcome of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) affecting both morbidity and mortality.
13084,1393,"Preliminary evidence suggested that, although not deregulated compared with sicca controls, miR200b-5p levels are decreased in the minor salivary glands (MSGs) of SS patients with NHL."
13085,1393,The aim of the current study was to evaluate the MSG expression of miR200b-5p in SS-associated NHLs and its potential predictive value for the identification of patients with SS susceptible to develop NHL.
13086,1393,"METHODS: miR200b-5p expression was investigated in MSG tissues of patients with SS who were at: (A) low risk and did not develop NHL during follow-up (n=27; median follow-up time on biopsy performance, range: 8.9years, 1.33-14years), (B) high-risk and diagnosed with NHL during follow-up (prelymphoma; n=17; median follow-up to until lymphoma diagnosis, range: 3.67years, 0.42-8.5years) and (C) had NHL (n=35), as well as non-SS sialadenitis controls (sarcoidosis and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, four each)."
13087,1393,"The differential miR200b-5p expression, correlations with disease features and its discriminative/predictive value, was evaluated by appropriate statistical approaches."
13088,1393,RESULTS: The MSG levels of miR200b-5p were significantly downregulated in patients with SS who will develop or have NHL and strongly discriminated (p<0.0001) them from those without lymphoma or non-SS sialadenitis.
13089,1393,"Furthermore, they were reduced long before clinical onset of lymphoma, did not significantly change on transition to lymphoma and, importantly, were proved strong independent predictors of patients who will develop NHL (p<0.0001)."
13090,1393,"CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that miR200b-5p levels in MSGs represent a novel predictive and possibly pathogenetic mechanism-related factor for the development of SS-associated NHL, since its expression is impaired years before lymphoma clinical onset."
13091,1394,"The dry eye disease (DED) is a chronic multifactorial disorder of the tears that also involves the ocular surface, the lacrimal glands, and meibomian dysfunction."
13092,1394,"Furthermore, DED is often associated with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and other autoimmune disorders."
13093,1394,"Sometimes, this chronic or subclinical condition is difficult to diagnose and treat, due to its heterogeneity."
13094,1394,Areas covered: A literature search of relevant publications about treatment of DED was performed.
13095,1394,All relevant articles published between 2011 and 2016 were identified through a computerized search for reviews and clinical trials using the Pub Med database.
13096,1394,"In particular, investigational treatments have been reported in this peer-reviewed publication."
13097,1394,"Relevant articles identified were manually searched and reviewed, then data concerning with novel treatment for DED were included into the manuscript."
13098,1394,Expert opinion: The treatment of dry eye patients evolves continuously because DED seriously impacts the quality of life of older adults.
13099,1394,"Indeed, as a chronic disease, DED prevalence is expected to worsen with the aging population."
13100,1394,"For this reason, current efforts focus on combined pharmacological strategies targeted towards multiple systems."
13101,1394,Probably this is the correct way to reach a long lasting symptoms relief treatment that may allow an actual improvement of patients' quality of life.
13102,1395,"The pathogenesis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is complex, in part due to DNA methylation abnormalities."
13103,1395,This study was undertaken to evaluate the importance of global DNA methylation ((5m)C) as determined in minor salivary glands (MSG) from well characterized pSS patients.
13104,1395,"Twenty-two pSS patients and ten controls were selected, and MSG were stained with anti-(5m)C, anti-(5m)C/anti-cytokeratin (KRT)19, or with anti-SSB/La antibodies (Ab)."
13105,1395,The DNA methylation status at the SSB gene promoter P1 and P1' was evaluated by methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (MSRE) coupled with PCR.
13106,1395,The effect of the DNA demethylating drug 5 azacytidine (5-Aza) was tested in the human salivary gland (HSG) cell line.
13107,1395,"In pSS, the reduction of global DNA methylation ((5m)C) was associated with lymphocyte infiltration, the emergence of (5m)C(low) and KRT19(high) acini, and the detection of circulating anti-SSB/La Ab, but not with disease activity (ESSDAI)."
13108,1395,"Next, treating HSG cells with 5-Aza was effective in inducing SSB expression."
13109,1395,"Finally in pSS patients positive for anti-SSB/La Ab, we further observed DNA demethylation at the SSB gene promoter P1 with consequent SSB overexpression at both the transcriptional and protein levels in salivary gland epithelial cells."
13110,1395,"In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of DNA methylation in the pathophysiology of pSS and to the emergence of anti-SSB/La Ab."
13111,1396,OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk and predictors of lymphoma development in a large cohort of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
13112,1396,"METHODS: Cox-regression analyses were used to study the predictive value of clinical and laboratory findings at pSS diagnosis, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves to compare survival probability between patients who developed lymphoma and the total cohort."
13113,1396,Expected risk for lymphoma was calculated by comparison with the background population.
13114,1396,RESULTS: Eleven (4.5%) from 244 patients developed a non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).
13115,1396,Diffuse large B-cell and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas occurred at a similar frequency.
13116,1396,Three (27.3%) patients died: 2 due to transformation from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue to diffuse large B-cell.
13117,1396,"Purpura (HR 8.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.33-27.67), parotidomegaly (HR 6.75, 95%CI 1.89-23.99), anemia (HR 3.43, 95%CI 1.04-11.35), leukopenia (HR 8.70, 95%CI 2.38-31.82), lymphocytopenia (HR 16.47, 95%CI 3.45-78.67), hypergammaglobulinemia (HR 4.06, 95%CI 1.06-15.58), low C3 (HR 36.65, 95%CI 10.65-126.18), and low C4 (HR 39.70, 95%CI 8.85-126.18) levels at pSS diagnosis were significant predictors of NHL development, but only hypocomplementemia and lymphocytopenia were independent risk factors."
13118,1396,Hypocomplementemia was related to earlier development of NHL and higher mortality.
13119,1396,The cumulative risk of developing lymphoma ranged from 3.4% in the first 5 years to 9.8% at 15 years.
13120,1396,Standardized incidence ratio (95%CI) for NHL development was 15.6 (95%CI 8.7-28.2).
13121,1396,CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pSS have a 16-fold increased risk of developing lymphoma.
13122,1396,This risk increases with time.
13123,1396,Hypocomplementemia and lymphocytopenia at pSS diagnosis are the strongest predictors.
13124,1396,Survival is clearly reduced in patients with hypocomplementemia.
13125,1396,Indolent lymphomas tend to evolve over time toward a more aggressive histologic type.
13126,1397,OBJECTIVE: To propose the Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) therapy as a helpful supplementary treatment in patients with dry eye disease.
13127,1397,MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cross sectional design.
13128,1397,Medical records of patients in whom dry eye disease symptoms were not satisfactorily controlled with medical therapy alone and who underwent additional IPL with at least three sessions completed.
13129,1397,Data were analyzed before therapy and 3weeks after its completion to asses improvement.
13130,1397,"Determination of symptoms, through a visual analog scale; tear film stability, through tear Break Up Time (tBUT); measurement of tear secretion, through Schirmer Test; and ocular surface staining with Van Bijsterveld score were evaluated."
13131,1397,SPSS software and nonparametric analysis of repeated measures were used.
13132,1397,The study was approved by the ethics committee.
13133,1397,RESULTS: 50 eyes from 25 subjects were reviewed.
13134,1397,"There were 9 males (36%) and 16 females (64%), with a median age of 59years (IQR 52-64)."
13135,1397,The median of the symptoms scale was 8 (IQR 8-9) and 3 (IQR 2-4) before and after the therapy respectively (P<.05).
13136,1397,"The median of BUT was 4 (IQR 3-5) and 10 (IQR 8-11), Schirmer test was 13 (IQR 12-15) and 15 (IQR 13-20), and Van Bijsterveld score was 3 (RIC 3-4) and 2 (IQR 2-3) before and after the therapy respectively (P<.05, for all measurements)."
13137,1397,"CONCLUSION: IPL treatment has excellent results regarding both: dry eye disease symptoms improvement and in office objective tests such as tBUT, Schirmer test and Van Bijsterveld score; IPL could be considered as an effective adjunct for dry eye disease."
13138,1398,Dry mouth or xerostomia is the feeling that there is not sufficient saliva in the mouth.
13139,1398,If this is present all or most of the time then it can be uncomfortable.
13140,1398,It can also sometimes indicate health problems and as a result should be brought to the attention of a health care professional.
13141,1398,Xerostomia does not always equate to hyposalivation.
13142,1398,"There are ways to assess degrees of oral dryness, namely-CODS (clinical oral dryness scoring) which helps to give a numerical value to the oral signs."
13143,1399,"OBJECTIVES: To develop a questionnaire for the assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQL) in primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS), and to test its psychometric properties."
13144,1399,"METHODS: Based on the concepts of a previous qualitative study, a questionnaire for the assessment of HRQL in PSS (PSS-QoL) was developed."
13145,1399,Psychometric testing of PSS-QoL was performed after revising the first draft with feedback of patients (n = 6) and clinicians (n = 4).
13146,1399,"Convergent construct validity was assessed by correlating the score with the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) and Euro-QoL 5D (EQ-5D)."
13147,1399,Reliability was examined by asking patients to complete the questionnaire twice 1-2 weeks apart.
13148,1399,An English Version of the PSS-QoL was developed by using standard methodology with forward and back translation.
13149,1399,"RESULTS: Out of the 75 PSS patients, 91% were female, mean (SD) age was 58.5  12.5 years."
13150,1399,PSS-QoL consists of 25 questions and can be divided into two main categories: physical (discomfort and dryness) and psychosocial.
13151,1399,The internal consistency of the PSS-QoL revealed a Crohnbach's  of 0.892.
13152,1399,Strong and moderate correlations were found between the PSS-QoL and ESSPRI (corr(coeff) = 0.755) and EQ.
13153,1399,5D-pain/discomfort (corr(coeff) = 0.531).
13154,1399,"Reproducibility of the PSS-QoL was high, yielding an ICC of 0.958 (95% CI: 0.926-0.981)."
13155,1399,CONCLUSIONS: The PSS-QoL is the first specific tool for the assessment of patients' HRQL in PSS and showed good psychometric properties.
13156,1399,It may serve as a novel patient-reported outcome measure in future clinical studies.
13157,1400,Sjogren's syndrome is a rare chronic recurrent disease which etiopathogenesis is still unknown.
13158,1400,Salivary glands involvement in Sjogren's syndrome is often associated with viral infection.
13159,1400,In order to prove this hypothesis we have conducted virological studies in four patients with Sjogren's syndrome.
13160,1400,The studies showed no correlation of Epstein-Barr virus or CMV and Sjogren's syndrome development.
13161,1400,Patients with Sjogren's syndrome may be Epstein-Barr virus carriers.
13162,1401,PURPOSE: To comparatively evaluate the efficacy of a bandage contact lens (BCL) and autologous serum (AS) eye drops in the management of severe dry eye caused by Sjgren syndrome (SS).
13163,1401,"METHODS: In this prospective randomized study, 40 patients with SS were enrolled."
13164,1401,Patients were divided into 2 treatment groups: BCL and AS.
13165,1401,"RESULTS: A total of 37 patients were included, 18 patients (35 eyes) in the AS group and 19 patients (36 eyes) in the BCL group."
13166,1401,"At the end of 6 weeks, the best-corrected visual acuity improved significantly in the BCL group (0.5  0.3 vs. 0.3  0.2, P = 0.003) but not in the AS group (0.4  0.3 vs. 0.3  0.3, P = 0.11)."
13167,1401,"The best-corrected visual acuity remained stable up to 6 weeks after discontinuation of the BCL (0.5  0.3 vs. 0.4  0.2, P = 0.03)."
13168,1401,"Although the Ocular Surface Disease Index scores decreased significantly after treatment in both groups, patients in the BCL group had lower Ocular Surface Disease Index scores than those in the AS group (53.4 vs. 41.8 at week 3, 47.1 vs. 31.0 at week 6, 52.7 vs. 32.0 at week 12; P = 0.014, <0.001, <0.004, respectively)."
13169,1401,"The ""faces"" scores showed improved quality of life in both groups."
13170,1401,Tear break-up time improved significantly in both groups except at 6 weeks after discontinuation of the AS.
13171,1401,Patients in the BCL group had lower corneal staining scores than those of the AS group after 6 weeks of treatment and 6 weeks after discontinuation of treatment (P < 0.01).
13172,1401,There was no significant change in Schirmer I test scores between or within groups.
13173,1401,CONCLUSIONS: Balafilcon A silicone hydrogel contact lenses as a BCL were effective in the management of SS-associated dry eye.

13175,1401,Unique identifier: NCT02147509.
13176,1402,"OBJECTIVES: We wanted to determine the MID for the HAQ, pain, fatigue, sleep and global VAS (0-100mm) in Sjgren's syndrome (SS) using a patient-reported overall health status anchor."
13177,1402,"METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) who had answered a standardised questionnaire at two consecutive visits including an overall health status question: 'How would you describe your overall status since your last visit: much better, better, the same, worse, much worse?'"
13178,1402,were included.
13179,1402,The MID was calculated as the mean change between visits for those who rated their disease as better or worse.
13180,1402,Scales on VAS were from 0 (best) to 100 (worst).
13181,1402,"RESULTS: Forty patients met the inclusion criteria (97% female, mean age 58 years, mean disease duration 10 years)."
13182,1402,The mean baseline HAQ was 0.68.
13183,1402,Ten rated their status as better and 14 as worse than the previous visit.
13184,1402,"MID estimates for improvemenT/worsening (SD) respectively were: -7.4 (27.8) / 20.7 (20.0) for pain VAS, -6.2 (28.3) / 15.2 (21.8) for fatigue VAS, -24.0 (24.0) / 15.2 (28.0) for sleep VAS, -0.18 (0.23) / 0.14 (0.30) for HAQ and -23.1 (21.6) / 16.4 (20.9) for global VAS."
13185,1402,"Spearman's rho correlation coefficients for the patient-reported outcomes were 0.38 (pain VAS), 0.54 (fatigue VAS), 0.55 (sleep VAS), 0.39 (HAQ), and 0.57 (global VAS), p<0.05."
13186,1402,CONCLUSIONS: The MID for pain and fatigue are greater for worsening than improvement.
13187,1402,A small change in the HAQ is detected as a change in status by the patient.
13188,1402,This knowledge may aid those who treat SS and in designing intervention studies.
13189,1403,OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of Xerostom() toothpaste and mouthwash in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients with xerostomia.
13190,1403,"SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A double-blinded, randomized study where patients were assigned at baseline test or control products."
13191,1403,Patients used the products 3times/day/28days.
13192,1403,"We used a visual analogue scale (VAS) for xerostomia and an Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14), baseline and after treatment, to assess possible improvement."
13193,1403,"RESULTS: A total of 28 patients with pSS were included in this study, but only 24 finished it (all women, mean age 55.2111.87), and 13 patients received the test and 11 the control."
13194,1403,VAS and OHIP-14 scores decreased in both groups after treatment but significant differences between groups were not found.
13195,1403,We do not detect VAS intragroup significant differences before and after treatment in test and control groups.
13196,1403,"A significant improvement in OHIP-14 was identified in the treatment group, while no significant differences were observed in the control group."
13197,1403,No adverse effects were present.
13198,1403,"CONCLUSIONS: Xerostom() toothpaste and mouthrinse may alleviate and improve quality of life without associated side effects, but further research with a larger number of participants and follow-up are necessary to establish the positive efficacy of these topical products in pSS patients."
13199,1404,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of Th17 polymorphisms on the susceptibility or severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
13200,1404,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sample comprised 206 individuals of both genders divided into three groups: exclusive rheumatoid arthritis (RA-100 patients), rheumatoid arthritis and Sjgren's syndrome (RA/SS-31 patients), and healthy controls (C-75 individuals)."
13201,1404,"All the individuals were submitted to clinical evaluation, unstimulated sialometry, and Schirmer test; some patients with RA were also submitted to minor salivary gland biopsy for definition of SS diagnosis."
13202,1404,Saliva samples were collected for isolation of DNA and genotyping of Th17 genes; IL-17A (-197G/A) and IL-17F (7488T/C).
13203,1404,"RESULTS: IL-17A (-197G/A) and IL-17F (7488T/C) SNPs were not associated with susceptibility to RA or secondary SS (sSS, p > 0.05 for both SNPs)."
13204,1404,"In addition, they did not influence RA activity or clinical markers of SS."
13205,1404,CONCLUSION: IL-17A (-197G/A) and IL-17F (7488T/C) polymorphisms are not associated with the susceptibility nor to the severity of RA and sSS in the studied population.
13206,1404,CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A better understanding of the pathogenesis of SS is demanded to an adequate treatment as well as to the development of new management strategies.
13207,1405,PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of topical rapamycin in treating autoimmune dacryoadenitis in a mouse model of Sjgren's syndrome.
13208,1405,METHODS: We developed rapamycin in a poly(ethylene glycol)-distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-DSPE) micelle formulation to maintain solubility.
13209,1405,"Rapamycin or PEG-DSPE eye drops (vehicle) were administered in a well-established Sjgren's syndrome disease model, the male nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, twice daily for 12 weeks starting at 8 weeks of age."
13210,1405,"Mouse tear fluid was collected and tear Cathepsin S, a putative tear biomarker for Sjgren's syndrome, was measured."
13211,1405,"Lacrimal glands were retrieved for histological evaluation, and quantitative real-time PCR of genes associated with Sjgren's syndrome pathogenesis."
13212,1405,"Tear secretion was measured using phenol red threads, and corneal fluorescein staining was used to assess corneal integrity."
13213,1405,RESULTS: Lymphocytic infiltration of lacrimal glands from rapamycin-treated mice was significantly (P = 0.0001) reduced by 3.8-fold relative to vehicle-treated mice after 12 weeks of treatment.
13214,1405,"Rapamycin, but not vehicle, treatment increased tear secretion and decreased corneal fluorescein staining after 12 weeks."
13215,1405,"In rapamycin-treated mice, Cathepsin S activity was significantly reduced by 3.75-fold in tears (P < 0.0001) and 1.68-fold in lacrimal gland lysates (P = 0.003) relative to vehicle-treated mice."
13216,1405,"Rapamycin significantly altered the expression of several genes linked to Sjgren's syndrome pathogenesis, including major histocompatibility complex II, TNF-, IFN-, and IL-12a, as well as Akt3, an effector of autophagy."
13217,1405,"CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that topical rapamycin reduces autoimmune-mediated lacrimal gland inflammation while improving ocular surface integrity and tear secretion, and thus has potential for treating Sjgren's syndrome-associated dry eye."
13218,1406,OBJECTIVES: To systematically review applications of fractal geometry in different aspects of dental practice.
13219,1406,"In this review, we present a short introduction to fractals and specifically address the following topics: treatment and healing monitoring, dental materials, dental tissue, caries, osteoporosis, periodontitis, cancer, Sjgren's syndrome, diagnosis of several other conditions and a discussion on the reliability of FD determinations from dental radiographs."
13220,1406,"SOURCES: Google Scholar, Ovid MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, etc."
13221,1406,(up to August 2010).
13222,1406,"STUDY SELECTION: The review considered original studies, reviews and conference proceedings, published in English or Spanish."
13223,1406,Abstracts and posters were not taken into account.
13224,1406,CONCLUSIONS: Fractal geometry has found plenty of applications in several branches of dental practice.
13225,1406,It provides a way to quantify the complexity of structures.
13226,1406,"Whereas one desires to study a radiograph, an histological section or the signal from a transducer, there are several methods available to determine the degree of complexity using fractal analysis."
13227,1406,"Several pathological conditions can alter the complexity of anatomical structures, and this change can be detectable with the help of fractal parameters."
13228,1406,"Although during the last two decades there have been plenty of works on the field, reported cases having enough reproducibility, with different groups showing similar results are not very common."
13229,1406,Further replications are needed before we can establish statistically significant correlations amongst fractal parameters and pathological conditions.
13230,1407,Systemic autoimmune disorders may interfere with normal reproductive function resulting in negative outcome of pregnancy.
13231,1407,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a common rheumatic disease that mostly affects females.
13232,1407,There are many reports that this condition may increase risk of pregnancy complications and fetal loss.
13233,1407,"However, data regarding these adverse outcomes are scarce and inconclusive."
13234,1407,We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of available articles that assess the association between pSS and adverse pregnancy outcome.
13235,1407,We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from their dates of inception to March 2016 and reviewed papers with validity criteria.
13236,1407,A random-effects model was used to evaluate pregnancy complications in patients with pSS and healthy controls.
13237,1407,"From 20 full-text articles, 7 studies involving 544 patients and 1586 pregnancies were included in the meta-analysis."
13238,1407,"Fetal complications included spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal deaths, and intrauterine growth retardation."
13239,1407,"Compared with healthy pregnancy, patients with pSS had significantly higher chance of neonatal deaths (pooled odds ratio (OR)=1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 1.46, p=0.01)."
13240,1407,"However, there were no significant associations between pSS and premature birth (OR=2.10, 95% CI 0.59-7.46, p=0.25), spontaneous abortion (OR=1.46, 95% CI 0.72-2.93, p=0.29), artificial abortion (OR=1.12, 95% CI 0.52-2.61, p=0.71), or stillbirth (OR=1.05, 95% CI 0.38-2.97, p=0.92)."
13241,1407,There is an increased risk of fetal loss in pregnant patients with pSS.
13242,1407,The presented evidence further supports multidisciplinary care for these patients to prevent complications during pregnancy.
13243,1408,OBJECTIVES: To report on fatigue in patients from the United Kingdom primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) registry identifying factors associated with fatigue and robust to assignable causes such as comorbidities and medications associated with drowsiness.
13244,1408,"METHODS: From our cohort (n = 608), we identified those with comorbidities associated with fatigue, and those taking medications associated with drowsiness."
13245,1408,"We constructed dummy variables, permitting the contribution of these potentially assignable causes of fatigue to be assessed."
13246,1408,"Using multiple regression analysis, we modelled the relationship between Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort physical and mental fatigue scores and potentially related variables."
13247,1408,"RESULTS: Pain, depression and daytime sleepiness scores were closely associated with both physical and mental fatigue (all p  0.0001)."
13248,1408,"In addition, dryness was strongly associated with physical fatigue (p  0.0001)."
13249,1408,These effects were observed even after adjustment for comorbidities associated with fatigue or medications associated with drowsiness.
13250,1408,"CONCLUSIONS: These findings support further research and clinical interventions targeting pain, dryness, depression and sleep to improve fatigue in patients with pSS.This finding is robust to both the effect of other comorbidities associated with fatigue and medications associated with drowsiness."
13251,1409,BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that involves the exocrine glands and internal organs.
13252,1409,pSS leads to destruction and loss of secretory function due to intense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration.
13253,1409,"Therapeutic options include mainly symptomatic and supportive measures, and traditional immunosuppressant drugs have shown no effectiveness in randomized trials."
13254,1409,Rituximab (RTX) is a chimeric antibody anti-CD20 that leads to B cell depletion by diverse mechanisms.
13255,1409,There is evidence that this drug may be effective for treating pSS.
13256,1409,The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate Rituximab effectiveness and safety for treating pSS.
13257,1409,"METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic review of RCTs published until December 2015, with no language restriction."
13258,1409,"We registered a protocol on Plataforma Brasil (40654814.6.0000.5505) and developed search strategies for the following scientific databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and LILACS."
13259,1409,We included adults with established pSS diagnosis and considered the use of Rituximab as intervention and the use of other drugs or placebo as control.
13260,1409,Four studies met our eligibility criteria: three with low risk of bias and one with uncertain risk of bias.
13261,1409,"The total number of participants was 276 (145 RTX, 131 placebo)."
13262,1409,"We assessed the risk of bias of each included study and evaluated the following as primary outcomes: lacrimal gland function, salivary gland function, fatigue improvement and adverse events."
13263,1409,"We found no significant differences between the groups in the Schirmer test at week 24 meta-analysis (MD 3.59, 95% CI -2.89 to 10.07)."
13264,1409,"Only one study evaluated the lissamine green test and reported a statistically significant difference between the groups at week 24 (MD -2.00, 95% CI -3.52 to -0.48)."
13265,1409,"There was a significant difference between the groups regarding salivary flow rate (MD 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16) and improvement in fatigue VAS at weeks 6 (RR 3.98, 95% CI 1.61 to 9.82) and week 16 (RR 3.08, 95% CI 1.21 to 7.80)."
13266,1409,"CONCLUSIONS: According to moderate quality evidence, the treatment with a single RTX course in patients with SSp presents discrete effect for improving lacrimal gland function."
13267,1409,Low-quality evidence indicates the potential of this drug for improving salivary flow.
13268,1409,"According to low quality evidence, no differences were observed in the evaluation after 24 weeks regarding fatigue reduction (30% VAS), serious adverse events occurrence, quality of life improvement and disease activity."
13269,1409,"With a very low level of evidence, there was no improvement in oral dryness VAS evaluation."
13270,1410,OBJECTIVES: Few studies have evaluated the association between Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and respiratory failure (RF).
13271,1410,"Thus, we conducted a retrospective national cohort study to investigate whether Sjogren's syndrome (SS) increases the risk of respiratory failure (RF)."
13272,1410,"METHODS: The cohort consisted of 4954 newly diagnosed patients with SS but without a previous diagnosis of RF, and 19816 patients as the comparison cohort from the catastrophic illnesses registry, obtained from the 2000-2005 period."
13273,1410,"All of the study participants were followed from the index date to December 31, 2011."
13274,1410,"We analyzed the association between the risk of RF and SS by using a Cox proportional hazards regression model, controlling for sex, age, and comorbidities."
13275,1410,RESULTS: The overall incidence rate of RF showed a 3.21-fold increase in the SS cohort compared with the comparison cohort.
13276,1410,"The adjusted HR of RF was 3.04 for the SS cohort compared with the comparison cohort, after we adjusted for sex, age, and comorbidities."
13277,1410,"The HRs of RF for patients with primary SS and secondary SS compared with the comparison cohort were 2.99 and 3.93, respectively (P for trend <.001)."
13278,1410,"The HRs of RF increased as the severity of SS increased, from 2.34 for those with no inpatient care experience to 5.15 for those with inpatient care experience (P for trend <.001)."
13279,1410,CONCLUSION: This study indicates that clinical physicians should not only consider secondary SS but also primary SS as a critical factor that increases the risk of RF.
13280,1411,BACKGROUND: The role of leptin in primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) pathogenesis is unknown.
13281,1411,The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of leptin and leptin receptor (LEPR) in minor salivary glands in patients with SS.
13282,1411,MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of leptin and LEPR in minor salivary gland specimens obtained from patients with primary SS (n=50) and control subjects (n=50) were examined using immunohistochemical staining.
13283,1411,"RESULTS: Acinar cells, epithelial cells and adipocytes in salivary glands can express leptin and LEPR."
13284,1411,It was observed that there was intense staining in the focal lymphocytic infiltration areas in SS patients.
13285,1411,"The intensity of leptin and LEPR staining under microscopy (400) were graded semiquantitatively as negative, mild, moderate or strongly positive, and scored as 1, 2 or 3, respectively."
13286,1411,The expression levels of leptin and LEPR in patients with primary SS were not higher than in controls.
13287,1411,"There was no significant difference in degrees of leptin and LEPR staining, staining intensity, and immunoreactive scores between groups."
13288,1411,"The expression of leptin and LEPR were not correlated with autoantibodies such as RF, ANA, anti-Ro, and/or anti-La positivity."
13289,1411,CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that leptin and its receptors do not play an important role in primary SS pathophysiology.
13290,1412,OBJECTIVES: To identify whether sleep disturbances are more prevalent in primary SS (pSS) patients compared with the general population and to recognize which specific sleep symptoms are particularly problematic in this population.
13291,1412,"METHODS: Electronic searches of the literature were conducted in PubMed, Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsychINFO (Ovid) and Web of Science and the search strategy registered a priori ."
13292,1412,"Titles and abstracts were reviewed by two authors independently against a set of prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria, reference lists were examined and a narrative synthesis of the included articles was conducted."
13293,1412,RESULTS: Eight whole-text papers containing nine separate studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the narrative analysis.
13294,1412,Few of these studies met all of the quality assessment criteria.
13295,1412,"The studies used a range of self-reported measures and objective measures, including polysomnography."
13296,1412,"Mixed evidence was obtained for some of the individual sleep outcomes, but overall compared with controls, pSS patients reported greater subjective sleep disturbances and daytime somnolence and demonstrated more night awakenings and pre-existing obstructive sleep apnoea."
13297,1412,CONCLUSIONS: A range of sleep disturbances are commonly reported in pSS patients.
13298,1412,Further polysomnography studies are recommended to confirm the increased prevalence of night awakenings and obstructive sleep apnoea in this patient group.
13299,1412,pSS patients with excessive daytime somnolence should be screened for co-morbid sleep disorders and treated appropriately.
13300,1412,"Interventions targeted at sleep difficulties in pSS, such as cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and nocturnal humidification devices, have the potential to improve quality of life in this patient group and warrant further investigation."
13301,1413,"Protein-losing gastroenteropathy (PLGE), a rare manifestation of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS), is characterized by profound edema and severe hypoalbuminemia secondary to excessive serum protein loss from the gastrointestinal tract and is clinically indistinguishable from nephrotic syndrome."
13302,1413,We report a case of a 30-year-old Taiwanese woman with PLGE-associated SS.
13303,1413,"In addition to a positive Schirmer's test, she had eye-dryness, thirst, and high levels of anti-SSA antibodies, fulfilling SS criteria."
13304,1413,"PLGE diagnosis was highly appropriate given the clinical profile of hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia, pleural effusion, and ascites, with absent cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease."
13305,1413,We were unable to perform technetium-99m-labeled human serum albumin scintigraphy ((99m)Tc-HAS).
13306,1413,"However, the patient's edema and albumin level improved dramatically in response to a 3-month regime of oral prednisolone followed by oral hydroxychloroquine."
13307,1414,Fatigue is prevalent and disabling in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
13308,1414,Results from studies in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) indicate that genetic variation may influence fatigue.
13309,1414,The aim of this study was to investigate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variations in pSS patients with high and low fatigue.
13310,1414,A panel of 85 SNPs in 12 genes was selected based on previous studies in CFS.
13311,1414,A total of 207 pSS patients and 376 healthy controls were genotyped.
13312,1414,One-hundred and ninety-three patients and 70 SNPs in 11 genes were available for analysis after quality control.
13313,1414,"Patients were dichotomized based on fatigue visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, with VAS <50 denominated ""low fatigue"" (n=53) and VAS 50 denominated ""high fatigue"" (n=140)."
13314,1414,We detected signals of association with pSS for one SNP in SLC25A40 (unadjusted p=0.007) and two SNPs in PKN1 (both p=0.03) in our pSS case versus control analysis.
13315,1414,The association with SLC25A40 was stronger when only pSS high fatigue patients were analysed versus controls (p=0.002).
13316,1414,One SNP in PKN1 displayed an association in the case-only analysis of pSS high fatigue versus pSS low fatigue (p=0.005).
13317,1414,This candidate gene study in pSS did reveal a trend for associations between genetic variation in candidate genes and fatigue.
13318,1414,The results will need to be replicated.
13319,1414,"More research on genetic associations with fatigue is warranted, and future trials should include larger cohorts and multicentre collaborations with sharing of genetic material to increase the statistical power."
13320,1415,"OBJECTIVES: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocyte infiltration into the salivary and lachrymal glands, leading to dry mouth and eyes."
13321,1415,The presence of functional autoantibodies against muscarinic type 3 receptor (M3R) has been reported in pSS patients.
13322,1415,"However, the pathological role of anti-M3R autoantibodies in pSS salivary dysfunction remains controversial."
13323,1415,METHODS: Purified IgGs were obtained from normal (control) and primary SS patients' sera (pSS IgG).
13324,1415,Internalization of M3R and clathrin was analyzed by biochemical assay and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy using human submandibular gland (hSMG) cells.
13325,1415,Cytoplasmic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) was measured by microspectrofluorimetry.
13326,1415,RESULTS: Incubation of hSMG cells with pSS IgG (1mg/ml) significantly decreased M3R expression levels at the membrane.
13327,1415,Carbachol-induced [Ca(2+)](i) transients (CICTs) in these cells were also inhibited by pSS IgG.
13328,1415,"In contrast to pSS IgG, control IgG had no effect on both the M3R expression level and CICTs."
13329,1415,"We found that binding of pSS IgG to M3R induces phosphorylation of the receptor, and that the pSS IgG-induced M3R internalization is prevented by the lysosomal inhibitor, chloroquine."
13330,1415,"In addition, pSS IgG decreased membrane clathrin expression, which was inhibited by atropine."
13331,1415,Our immunofluorescence study further confirmed that pSS IgG induces a co-localization of M3R with clathrin and subsequent internalization of M3R.
13332,1415,CONCLUSION: pSS IgG induces internalization of M3R partly through a clathrin-mediated pathway.
13333,1415,The results suggest M3R internalization as a potential mechanism to explain the exocrinopathy seen in pSS patients.
13334,1416,PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An enlarged salivary gland or lacrimal gland raises a wide differential diagnosis that includes both benign inflammatory conditions and malignant disorders.
13335,1416,This review aims to address the numerous controversies that have arisen regarding inflammatory diseases of the salivary gland over the past two centuries and more specifically address the relevance of IgG4 in this setting.
13336,1416,"RECENT FINDINGS: A significant percentage of cases previously classified as Mikulicz disease, Kttner tumor, and orbital pseudotumor (idiopathic orbital inflammation) show elevated numbers of IgG4-positive plasma cells, and some of these cases also show elevated levels of serum IgG4."
13337,1416,These data support the evolving concept of IgG4-associated sialadenitis/dacroadenitis.
13338,1416,The disease presents with enlargement of one of more salivary gland(s) and/or lacrimal gland(s).
13339,1416,"Histologically this disease is characterized by a dense polyclonal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, and is frequently associated with germinal centers, fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis."
13340,1416,"IgG4-bearing plasma cells are virtually always present, as is an elevated ratio of IgG4 to IgG containing plasma cells."
13341,1416,SUMMARY: IgG4-related sialadenitis belongs to the IgG4-related systemic disease spectrum and shows a swift response to immunosuppression.
13342,1417,Orofacial manifestations occur frequently in rheumatic diseases and usually represent early signs of disease or of its activity that are still neglected in clinical practice.
13343,1417,"Among the autoimmune rheumatic diseases with potential for oral manifestations, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory myopathies (IM), systemic sclerosis (SSc), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), relapsing polychondritis (RP) and Sjgren's syndrome (SS) can be cited."
13344,1417,"Signs and symptoms such as oral hyposalivation, xerostomia, temporomandibular joint disorders, lesions of the oral mucosa, periodontal disease, dysphagia, and dysphonia may be the first expression of these rheumatic diseases."
13345,1417,This article reviews the main orofacial manifestations of rheumatic diseases that may be of interest to the rheumatologist for diagnosis and monitoring of autoimmune rheumatic diseases.
13346,1418,"While there is still no convincing evidence that methotrexate is of benefit in primary Sjgren's syndrome, the SLE evidence on this rheumatology anchor drug is substantial."
13347,1418,"In fact, there are randomised controlled trials showing the benefit for methotrexate on overall SLE activity, reduction in glucocorticoid doses, and effects on lupus arthritis and lupus skin manifestations."
13348,1418,"In addition, methotrexate may be helpful in vasculitis, haematological manifestations, and perhaps kidney disease."
13349,1418,Intrathecal methotrexate was successfully used in neuropsychiatric SLE.
13350,1418,"Taken together, using methotrexate in SLE is not only a common approach, but, at least in part, supported by evidence from clinical trials."
13351,1419,"A 45-year-old female with a history of dry eyes presented with chronic progressive disturbance of her right finger extension, bilateral foot drops, and dysesthesia in the left lower leg."
13352,1419,"On admission, neurological examination revealed decreased tendon reflex in the right upper limb and bilateral lower limbs, and dysesthesia in the distal outer portions of the bilateral lower legs."
13353,1419,Her vibration sensation was moderately diminished in both lower legs.
13354,1419,"Weakness ranging from moderate to severe was predominantly found in the muscles innervated by the radial (r > l), medial (r > l), ulnar (r > l), deep peroneal (r  l), tibial (r < l), and medial planter nerves (r < l)."
13355,1419,"Nerve conduction study showed asymmetrical axonal neuropathy, while chronic neurogenic changes were observed on needle electromyography."
13356,1419,"Cerebrospinal fluid analysis results were unremarkable, except for an elevated IgG index (1.53) and the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands."
13357,1419,"Seropositive anti-SS-A antibody and histological findings of the biopsied minor salivary gland, as well as the lack of other connective tissue disorders, indicated primary Sjgren syndrome (SjS)."
13358,1419,"A left sural nerve biopsy showed inhomogeneous reductions in the myelinated fibers within fascicules, mild infiltration of CD8-positive T lymphocytes around small vessels, and no fibrinoid necrosis in the arteries."
13359,1419,"From these findings, the diagnosis of motor-dominant multiple mononeuritis associated with primary SjS was made."
13360,1419,"Therapy that comprised a single course of intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (1g for 3 days), followed by oral prednisolone (60mg/day) with gradual tapering, resulted in no amelioration of her symptoms."
13361,1419,"She then received IV immunoglobulin (0.4mg/kg/day for 5 days), which resulted in moderate improvement in the strength of several muscles and a reduction of CSF IgG index (0.89)."
13362,1419,A wide variety of peripheral nerve complications are documented in primary SjS.
13363,1419,"However, the present case is unique in the symptoms of chronic progressive, motor-dominant, multiple mononeuritic phenotype."
13364,1420,Chemokine-dependent signaling in immune cells is a very important mechanism leading to integrin activation and leukocyte recruitment.
13365,1420,"During the last years, several studies were performed investigating the role of the chemokine Growth-related oncogene-alpha (GRO-) and its receptor CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) in different diseases."
13366,1420,"Recently, many new functions and properties of GRO-/CXCR2 system have been discovered and associated with atherosclerosis, angiogenesis, and many inflammatory conditions, such as autoimmune diseases."
13367,1420,"The purpose of this review is to discuss current advances in our understanding of the function of the GRO-/CXCR2 system and related clinical implications associated with autoimmune diseases, such as primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSjS)."
13368,1420,Included is a discussion of the role of the ADAM17 metalloproteinase in modulating the GRO-/CXCR2 axis in pSjS.
13369,1420,Notably inhibitors of ADAM17 are being developed for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases.
13370,1420,We hope to further evaluate this system in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases to promote a background for therapeutic interventions.
13371,1421,"OBJECTIVE: Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is associated with decreased saliva production and interincisal distance, more missing teeth, and periodontal disease."
13372,1421,We undertook this study to determine the clinical correlates of SSc with these oral abnormalities.
13373,1421,METHODS: Subjects were recruited from the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group cohort.
13374,1421,Detailed dental and clinical examinations were performed according to standardized protocols.
13375,1421,Associations between dental abnormalities and selected clinical and serologic manifestations of SSc were examined.
13376,1421,"RESULTS: One hundred sixty-three SSc subjects were included: 90% women, mean  SD age 56  11 years, mean  SD disease duration 14  8 years, 72% with limited cutaneous disease, and 28% with diffuse cutaneous disease."
13377,1421,"Decreased saliva production was associated with Sjgren's syndrome-related autoantibodies ( = -43.32; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] -80.89, -5.75), but not with disease severity ( = -2.51; 95% CI -8.75, 3.73)."
13378,1421,"Decreased interincisal distance was related to disease severity ( = -1.02; 95% CI -1.63, -0.42) and the modified Rodnan skin thickness score ( = -0.38; 95% CI -0.53, -0.23)."
13379,1421,"The number of missing teeth was associated with decreased saliva production (relative risk [RR] 0.97; 95% CI 0.94, 0.99), worse hand function (RR 1.52; 95% CI 1.13, 2.02), and the presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; RR 1.68 [95% CI 1.14, 2.46])."
13380,1421,No clinical or serologic variables were correlated with periodontal disease.
13381,1421,"CONCLUSION: In SSc, diminished interincisal distance is related to overall disease severity."
13382,1421,Decreased saliva production is related to concomitant Sjgren's syndrome antibodies.
13383,1421,"Tooth loss is associated with poor upper extremity function, GERD, and decreased saliva."
13384,1421,The etiology of excess periodontal disease is likely multifactorial and remains unclear.
13385,1422,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and significance of IgG-anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) antibody in PSS patients.
13386,1422,METHODS: A total of 120 patients diagnosed with PSS were investigated in the first affiliated hospital of Baotou Medical College from March 2006 to December 2009.
13387,1422,"IgG-anti-CCP antibody was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), also anti-Sjogren's syndrome type A (SSA) and Sjogren's syndrome type B (SSB) antibody were assayed by immunoblotting."
13388,1422,"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was assayed by westergren in serum, and C reactive protein (CRP), IgA, IgM, IgG and IgM-RF were detected by immune turbidimetric."
13389,1422,"At the same time, clinical symptoms and involvement of important organs were observed."
13390,1422,"Following up the patients above 3 years, the primary Sjogren's syndrome (PSS) patients who had progressed to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were evaluated."
13391,1422,"RESULTS: The positive rate of anti-CCP antibody in the PSS patients was 19.17%; After 3 years, more patients who were positive for anti-CCP antibody had progressed to RA ( = 5.015,P=0.022) than the patients in negative group; The patients in anti-CCP antibody positive group were more prone to joint involvement ( = 8.058,P<0.05), more swollen joints (U=152.00, P<0.05) and longer morning stiffness (U=100.00, P<0.05) than the patients with negative anti-CCP antibody, but the involvement of vital organs in the two groups had no significant difference ( = 0.208,0.099,0.000 and 0.122, P>0.05); The positive rate of anti-SSA and SSB antibody in anti-CCP antibody positive group and negative group had no significant difference ( = 0.008 and 0.56, P>0.05); Multiple linear regression showed that the level of anti-CCP antibody was positively correlated with IgM-RF levels in the PSS patients (B=0.61, 95% CI=0.36-0.86, P<0.05), but had no significant correlation with ESR, CRP, IgA, IgM and IgG levels (P>0.05).There were no significant differences in the level of ESR, CRP, IgA, IgM and IgG between anti-CCP antibody positive group and negative group (P>0.05), but the level of IgM-RF in anti-CCP antibody positive group was significantly higher than that in the negative group (U=623.50, P<0.05)."
13392,1422,"CONCLUSION: Positive rate of IgG-anti-CCP antibody in PSS is 19.17%, also it is associated with joint involvement and more prone to progressing to RA."
13393,1423,OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether aquaporins (AQPs) are involved in salivary gland dysfunction in patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) complicated with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
13394,1423,"METHODS: Eight primary SS (pSS) patients, four NMO spectrum disorder (NMOsd) patients complicated with SS (NMOsd-SS), and three control subjects were enrolled."
13395,1423,"Immunohistochemistry of labial salivary glands (LSGs) was performed to determine the expressions of AQP4, AQP5, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-)."
13396,1423,In vitro expression of AQP5 was examined by Western blotting in cultured primary salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs).
13397,1423,RESULTS: No expression of AQP4 was shown in all LSGs.
13398,1423,"AQP5 was clearly expressed in the all acini, but the predominant localization of AQP5 in the apical side was diminished in the patients with pSS or NMOsd-SS compared with the controls and tended to be even lower in NMOsd-SS than pSS."
13399,1423,The abnormal localization of AQP5 was associated with poor saliva secretion.
13400,1423,No difference was found in TNF- expression in the LSGs between patients with pSS and NMOsd-SS.
13401,1423,AQP5 expression of SGECs in vitro was not changed by TNF- or interleukin-10.
13402,1423,CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that AQP5 but not AQP4 contributes to salivary secretion in patients with SS including those with NMO complicated with SS.
13403,1424,AIM: To investigate the association between autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) and systemic autoimmune diseases (SAIDs) by measurement of serum immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4).
13404,1424,METHODS: The serum level of IgG4 was measured in 61 patients with SAIDs of different types who had not yet participated in glucocorticosteroid treatment.
13405,1424,"Patients with an elevated IgG4 level were examined by abdominal ultrasonography (US) and, in some cases, by computer tomography (CT)."
13406,1424,RESULTS: Elevated serum IgG4 levels (919  996 mg/L) were detected in 17 (28%) of the 61 SAID patients.
13407,1424,"10 patients had Sjgren's syndrome (SS) (IgG4: 590  232 mg/L), 2 of them in association with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and 7 patients (IgG4: 1388  985.5 mg/L) had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)."
13408,1424,The IgG4 level in the SLE patients and that in patients with SS were not significantly different from that in AIP patients (783  522 mg/L).
13409,1424,Abdominal US and CT did not reveal any characteristic features of AIP among the SAID patients with an elevated IgG4 level.
13410,1424,CONCLUSION: The serum IgG4 level may be elevated in SAIDs without the presence of AIP.
13411,1424,The determination of serum IgG4 does not seem to be suitable for the differentiation between IgG4-related diseases and SAIDs.
13412,1425,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether ultrasonographic scoring of (i) both parotid and submandibular salivary glands and (ii) all individual components of the Hocevar scoring system, is needed for classifying patients as primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
13413,1425,"METHODS: Ultrasound examination of the major salivary glands (sUS) was performed in 204 consecutive patients clinically suspected (n=171) or diagnosed (n=33) with pSS.Parenchymal echogenicity, homogeneity, hypoechogenic areas, hyperechogenic reflections and salivary gland posterior border were scored in left and right parotid and submandibular glands."
13414,1425,Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess which glands and sUS components contributed significantly to classification as pSS or non-pSS according to the 2016 American College of Rheumatology-European League Against Rheumatism (ACR-EULAR) criteria.
13415,1425,"RESULTS: 116 (57%) patients were classified as pSS, the remaining as non-pSS."
13416,1425,"Instead of scoring both sides (area under the curve; AUC=0.856, Nagelkerke R(2)=0.526), multivariate analysis showed that sUS scoring of only right (AUC=0.850; R(2)=0.518) or left (AUC=0.852; R(2)=0.511) parotid and submandibular glands is sufficient to predict ACR-EULAR classification."
13417,1425,"Moreover, all individual components of the Hocevar scoring system significantly predicted classification."
13418,1425,Multivariate analysis showed that parenchymal echogenicity and hypoechogenic areas contributed independently to ACR-EULAR classification (AUC=0.857; R(2)=0.539).
13419,1425,Scoring these components in one parotid and one submandibular gland highly predicted ACR-EULAR classification (AUC=0.855; R(2)=0.539).
13420,1425,Scoring only hypoechogenic areas on one side showed almost similar results (AUC=0.846; R(2)=0.498).
13421,1425,CONCLUSION: sUS examination of parotid and submandibular glands on one side is sufficient to predict classification of patients according to the ACR-EULAR criteria.
13422,1425,"To further increase feasibility of sUS in outpatient clinics worldwide, only hypoechogenic areas can be scored."
13423,1426,OBJECTIVES: To explore the potential values of serum galectin-3 (Gal-3) levels in diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) for patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
13424,1426,METHODS: The concentrations of serum Gal-3 and interleukin (IL)-17 were measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 87 patients with pSS and 30 healthy controls (HC).
13425,1426,"The levels of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), immunoglobulin (Ig)G, complement (C3), albumin (ALB) and Fibrinogen (FIB) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were measured."
13426,1426,ILD was identified on high-resolution computed tomography.
13427,1426,RESULTS: The levels of serum Gal-3 and IL-17 were significantly higher in pSS patients than in HC.
13428,1426,Stratification analyses indicated significantly higher levels of Gal-3 in pSS patients with ILD and in those with positive ANCA.
13429,1426,"In comparison with that of pSS patients without ILD, significantly higher levels of ESR, CRP, FIB, IgG, C3 and lower ALB were detected in pSS patients with ILD."
13430,1426,"The levels of galectin-3 were correlated positively with the values of CRP, FIB, IgG or IL-17 in patients with pSS."
13431,1426,"CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that higher levels of serum galectin-3 may be associated with the development of pSS, particularly with ILD."
13432,1427,Plasma hyperviscosity is a rare complication of both monoclonal and polyclonal disorders associated with elevation of immunoglobulins.
13433,1427,"Asymptomatic patients with an elevation in the serum viscosity do not require plasma exchange, and the majority will have other indications for therapeutic intervention."
13434,1427,"For patients with hemorrhagic or central nervous system manifestations, plasma exchange is the therapy of choice and is relatively safe."
13435,1427,Viscosity measurements are not required to initiate therapy if the index of suspicion is high and the clinical presentation is typical.
13436,1427,"However, patients should have a sample sent for confirmation of the diagnosis."
13437,1427,Whole-blood hyperviscosity is seen in patients with extreme elevation of the red cell and white cell count.
13438,1427,Phlebotomy of patients with primary and secondary elevation of the red cell count is a well-established therapy.
13439,1428,Lacrimal gland inflammation during autoimmune Sjgren's syndrome (SS) leads to ocular surface inflammation - Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS).
13440,1428,This condition afflicts both the cornea and conjunctiva that form the ocular surface.
13441,1428,Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) deficiency in mice results in lacrimal gland and corneal inflammation that resembles the human disease.
13442,1428,In this study we report conjunctival pathology in this mouse model of SS.
13443,1428,We found that TSP-1 null mice develop inflammation in the conjunctiva and associated loss of goblet cell function similar to that seen in patients with SS.
13444,1428,"Increased expression of Th1 (IFN-, TNF-) and Th17 (IL-6, IL-17A) inflammatory cytokines and related transcription factors (Tbet and RORt) were detected in TSP-1 null conjunctiva as well as their draining lymph nodes (LNs)."
13445,1428,The conjunctival inflammation was also accompanied by an increase in local lymphatic vessels.
13446,1428,"Interestingly, migration of antigen-bearing dendritic cells (DCs) from the ocular surface to the LNs was dependent on the TSP-1 available in the tissue."
13447,1428,These results not only reveal potential immunopathogenic mechanisms underlying KCS in SS but also highlight the therapeutic potential of TSP-1.
13448,1429,"PURPOSE: To investigate the value of 3 novel autoantibodies [salivary protein 1 (SP1), carbonic anhydrase 6 (CA6), and parotid secretory protein (PSP)] in differentiating Sjgren's syndrome (SS)-related dry eye from non-SS dry eye."
13449,1429,"METHODS: Forty-six dry eye patients with SS (SS dry eye), 14 dry eye patients without SS (non-SS dry eye), and 25 controls were included."
13450,1429,The 2012 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria were used for the diagnosis of SS.
13451,1429,"After a detailed review of systems, the Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire, Schirmer test without anesthesia, tear film breakup time, and ocular surface staining were performed to assess dry eye."
13452,1429,All participants underwent serological testing using a commercially available finger prick kit.
13453,1429,RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients with SS (80.4%) had a positive traditional autoantibody and 28 (60.9%) had a positive novel autoantibody.
13454,1429,Traditional autoantibodies were absent in all non-SS dry eye patients and controls.
13455,1429,Novel autoantibodies were present in 7/14 (50%) non-SS dry eye patients and 4/25 (16%) controls.
13456,1429,"Among 3 novel autoantibodies, anti-CA6 was significantly more prevalent in the SS and non-SS dry eye groups than in controls (52.2% vs. 42.9% vs. 8.0%, P = 0.001)."
13457,1429,Dry eye patients with positive anti-CA6 alone were significantly younger than patients with only traditional autoantibodies.
13458,1429,Anti-CA6 was associated with worse dry eye signs and symptoms.
13459,1429,"CONCLUSIONS: Anti-CA6 was the most prevalent novel autoantibody in patients with dry eye, and was associated with younger age and more severe disease."
13460,1429,Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether anti-CA6 is a marker for early SS or perhaps another form of an autoimmune dry eye disease.
13461,1430,"MicroRNA-146a (miR-146a) is a microRNA supposed to regulate innate immune, inflammatory response and antiviral pathway negatively."
13462,1430,"Recently, its potential use as a biomarker for disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment has become widely investigated."
13463,1430,"In the current study, we measured the expression of miR-146a/b, and their target genes, IRAK1, IRAK4, TRAF6 in the peripheral mononuclear cells of patients with Sjgren's syndrome (n=21) and healthy controls (n=10) by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction."
13464,1430,"We found that both miR-146a and miR-146b, furthermore, the gene of TRAF6 were significantly overexpressed in the Sjgren's patients, whereas the expression of IRAK1 gene was significantly decreased."
13465,1430,The expression of IRAK4 did not differ significantly.
13466,1430,"These results suggest that in the peripheral mononuclear cells of Sjgren's patients, the transcriptional repression of IRAK1 is taking place, whereas the other NF-B pathway regulating gene, TRAF6 is overexpressed."
13467,1430,"As IRAK1 has been regarded a crucial gene in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, TRAF6 can be a Sjgren's syndrome specific biomarker, confirming and partly explaining the existance of different pathogenic pathways in the two diseases."
13468,1430,"These observations, however, need still wider confirmations."
13469,1431,OBJECTIVES: CD4+CD25high regulatory T cells (TREG) represent a suppressive T cell subset deeply involved in the modulation of immune responses and eventually in the prevention of autoimmunity.
13470,1431,Growing evidence demonstrated that patients with autoimmune and inflammatory chronic diseases display an impairment of TREG cells or activated effector T cells unresponsive to TREG.
13471,1431,"Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR) is a widely accepted marker of murine TREG cells, but little is known in humans."
13472,1431,Aim of the present study was to investigate the characteristics of different subsets of TREG cells in Sjgren's syndrome and the potential role of GITR as marker of human TREG cells.
13473,1431,METHODS: Fifteen patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and 10 sex- and age-matched normal controls (NC) were enrolled.
13474,1431,CD4+ T cells were magnetic sorted from peripheral blood by negative selection.
13475,1431,Cell phenotype was analyzed through flow-cytometry using primary and secondary antibodies.
13476,1431,Disease activity was assessed using the EULAR Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI).
13477,1431,"RESULTS: Although the proportion of circulating CD25highGITRhigh subset was similar in SS patients and NC, an expansion of the CD25-GITRhigh cell population was observed in the peripheral blood of SS patients."
13478,1431,"Interestingly, this expansion was more relevant in patients with inactive rather than active disease."
13479,1431,CONCLUSIONS: The number of CD4+CD25-GITRhigh cells is increased in SS as compared to NC.
13480,1431,"Moreover, the fact that the expansion of this cell subset is prevalently observed in patients with inactive disease suggests that these cells may play a role in counteracting inflammatory response."
13481,1432,OBJECTIVES: To better understand the real-world characteristics and costs of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
13482,1432,"METHODS: Analysing the MarketScan Commercial Claims database from Jan. 1, 2006 to Dec. 31, 2011, we identified 10,414 patients 18 years old newly diagnosed with SS."
13483,1432,"Patient characteristics, drugs (commonly used for SS), resource utilisation, and medical costs were evaluated for 12 months pre- and post-diagnosis."
13484,1432,RESULTS: Mean age was 55 years; 90% were female.
13485,1432,"At diagnosis, SS patients were most often seen by rheumatologists (39%) or internists (14.2%); the most common concurrent autoimmune conditions were rheumatoid arthritis (17.9%) and systemic lupus erythematosus (14.6%)."
13486,1432,"Other common comorbidities were hypertension (37.6%), osteoarthritis (31.4%), and hyperlipidaemia/dyslipidaemia (30.3%)."
13487,1432,"Post diagnosis of SS, claims for myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass graft doubled."
13488,1432,Medications of interest prescribed post-diagnosis were eye/mouth drugs (32.2%) and synthetic immunosuppressants (32.1%).
13489,1432,"Biologic drugs were prescribed to a minority (TNF inhibitors, ~5.0%; non-TNF inhibitors, 1%)."
13490,1432,"Of note, prescriptions for all systemic immunotherapies (synthetic and biologic) were significantly lower in the subgroup without concurrent autoimmune disease, and 15.1% of the overall population had no SS-related prescriptions."
13491,1432,"Post diagnosis, total medical resource utilisation and total medical costs increased (1.2 and 1.4-fold, respectively)."
13492,1432,"CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective, real-world analysis, medical claims in the first year after SS diagnosis revealed that cardiovascular (CV) events increased and all-cause healthcare costs grew by 40%."
13493,1432,Pharmacologic management consisted primarily of low potency immunomodulation and symptomatic treatments.
13494,1432,"Systemic disease-modifying therapies were used mostly in patients who had another concurrent autoimmune disease, suggesting a lack of treatment options for SS."
13495,1433,"Neurologic involvement is a common extraglandular manifestation of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), is varied and can be divided anatomically into 3 categories: central nervous system, peripheral neuropathies and autonomous nervous system manifestations."
13496,1433,"According to different study cohorts, neurological manifestations can occur in 18-45% of pSS patients, with the peripheral nervous system being the most frequent site of involvement compared to the central nervous system and autonomic system."
13497,1433,"Some neurologic complications share convergent pathophysiology, although the pathological basis of other conditions, namely cognitive impairment in pSS, is less clear."
13498,1433,"The heterogeneity of neurologic manifestations in pSS complicates the diagnosis and approach to treatment, which should be directed toward the underlying neuro-pathologic mechanism."
13499,1433,The diagnosis and treatment of these manifestations must be optimised in order to avoid severe disability.
13500,1433,"However, for the majority of the complications, evidence for treatment efficacy is limited and requires further investigation."
13501,1434,OBJECTIVES: The minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) is widely considered an important component of the diagnostic algorithm of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and is mentioned in all the classification criteria sets for the disease.
13502,1434,"The aim of this study, coordinated by the Italian Society of Rheumatology, was to verify the inter-observer agreement on the evaluation of MSGB among different experienced Italian rheumatologic centres, in order to better standardise the diagnostic methodology."
13503,1434,"METHODS: Seven centres participated in the study, providing a total of 50 MSGB samples."
13504,1434,Each center blindly classified all the samples according to the Chisholm and Mason (CM) grading.
13505,1434,The results were collected and analysed.
13506,1434,RESULTS: The inter-observer agreement was satisfactory when the samples were stratified as consistent and non-consistent with the final diagnosis of pSS (median  =0.75; mean  =0.70).
13507,1434,"Nonetheless, significant discrepancies in the histopathologic evaluation of MSGB emerged when the agreement was assessed on the single scores."
13508,1434,"Considering the modal CM grading for each sample as the correct grading, upon re-examination, a potential bias in the final clinical diagnosis was detected in 7 out of 50 samples."
13509,1434,CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown significant discrepancies in the evaluation of MSGB among different rheumatologic centres in the same country.
13510,1434,"Greater standardisation of the procedure is clearly necessary, both to improve the diagnostic performance and scientific communication."
13511,1435,Primary Sjgren's Syndrome (PSS) is characterized by dryness of the eyes and mouth due to lymphocytic infiltration of secretory exocrine glands.
13512,1435,"As well as disabling dryness, patients commonly have fatigue and arthralgia and an associated reduction in quality of life."
13513,1435,The condition principally affects adult women and is relatively common--approximately 1:1000 to 1:250 adult women are estimated to have the condition in European/North American studies.
13514,1435,"Current therapy is principally symptomatic with the use of artificial tears and oral gels, pastilles and sprays."
13515,1435,Medications to stimulate residual glandular secretion can be helpful for appropriate individuals.
13516,1435,"A proportion of patients also develop extraglandular features such as skin vasculitis, or lung, neurological, haematological or other systemic involvement."
13517,1435,"Conventional general immunosuppressive therapies such as corticosteroids or disease-modifying drugs, have been used in some patients with these clinical features."
13518,1435,Biologic therapies specifically directed against molecules involved in disease pathogenesis represent a potentially more effective approach to therapeutic intervention in rheumatic diseases including PSS.
13519,1435,"The greatest experience in PSS is with rituximab, an anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody already in use for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis."
13520,1435,A randomised placebo controlled study is currently recruiting in France and a further study is planned in the UK.
13521,1435,"This review discusses the utility of biologic therapies in PSS, potential challenges for their use, the available data on rituximab and the potential role for other biologic therapies currently in development, or in clinical trials, in other autoimmune conditions."
13522,1436,"The use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in Primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS) has been assessed in different studies over the last years, with conflicting results regarding its efficacy in sicca syndrome and extraglandular manifestations (EGM)."
13523,1436,"The goal of this study was to compare the incidence rate of EGM in pSS patients with and without HCQ therapy.We performed a multicenter retrospective study, including patients with pSS (European classification criteria) with at least 1year of follow-up."
13524,1436,"Subjects with concomitant fibromyalgia, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis were excluded."
13525,1436,Demographics and pSS characteristics were recorded.
13526,1436,The EGM were defined by EULAR-SS disease activity index (ESSDAI).
13527,1436,Patients were divided into two groups according to their use or not of HCQ therapy.
13528,1436,We evaluated the use of HCQ and its relationship to EGM.
13529,1436,HCQ therapy was defined as the continuous use of the drug for at least 3months.
13530,1436,A descriptive analysis of demographics and pSS characteristics was performed.
13531,1436,We compared the incidence of EGM between groups defined by HCQ therapy using chi(2) test or Fisher's exact test.
13532,1436,"A total of 221 patients were included (97.3% women), mean age, 55.7years (SD 14)."
13533,1436,"Mean age at diagnosis, 48.8years (SD 15); median disease duration, 60months (IQR 35-84)."
13534,1436,One hundred and seventy patients (77%) received HCQ.
13535,1436,"About half of the patients had at least one EGM during the course of the disease, 20% of them developed an EGM before the onset of the sicca syndrome and 26% simultaneously with dryness symptom."
13536,1436,"Overall, EGM were less frequent in those on HCQ therapy (36.5% vs 63.5%, p<0.001)."
13537,1436,"Considering each EGM individually, the following manifestations were more frequent in the non-treated group: arthritis (p<0.001), fatigue (p<0.001), purpura (p=0.01), Raynaud phenomenon (p=0.003), and hypergammaglobulinemia (p=0.006)."
13538,1436,"Immunosuppressive treatment was indicated on 28 patients (12.7%), 13 of which were receiving also HCQ."
13539,1436,"The first reason for those treatments was the presence of arthritis in 12/28 patients (42.8%), and the drug used in all the cases was methotrexate."
13540,1436,"Only three patients required immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide, due to the presence of glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, and interstitial lung disease."
13541,1436,None of the patients received biologic therapy.
13542,1436,The lower incidence of EGM was observed in patients on HCQ therapy supports its efficacy in pSS.
13543,1436,"However, further large scale prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings."
13544,1437,"OBJECTIVE: EMBODY 1 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01262365) and EMBODY 2 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01261793) investigated the efficacy and safety of epratuzumab, a CD22-targeted humanized monoclonal IgG antibody, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)."
13545,1437,The studies showed no significant difference from placebo in primary or secondary clinical outcome measures but did demonstrate B cell-specific immunologic activity.
13546,1437,The aim of this post hoc analysis was to determine whether epratuzumab had a different clinical efficacy profile in SLE patients with versus those without an associated diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
13547,1437,METHODS: The efficacy and safety of epratuzumab were compared between 2 patient subpopulations randomized in EMBODY 1 and 2: SLE patients with and those without a diagnosis of associated SS.
13548,1437,"British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) total score, BILAG-based Combined Lupus Assessment (BICLA) clinical response to treatment, biologic markers (including B cells, IgG, IgM, and IgA), and safety were assessed."
13549,1437,"RESULTS: A total of 1,584 patients were randomized in the EMBODY 1 and EMBODY 2 trials; 113 patients were anti-SSA positive and had a diagnosis of associated SS, and 1,375 patients (86.8%) had no diagnosis of associated SS (918 patients were randomized to receive epratuzumab and 457 to receive placebo)."
13550,1437,"For patients with associated SS, but not those without associated SS, a higher proportion of patients receiving epratuzumab achieved a BICLA response and a reduction from baseline in BILAG total score."
13551,1437,B cell reduction was faster in patients with associated SS.
13552,1437,The sensitivity of B cells to epratuzumab as measured by the mean concentration producing 50% of the maximum B cell count depletion was lower for patients with associated SS (9.5 g/ml) versus the total EMBODY population (87.1 g/ml).
13553,1437,No difference in the frequency of adverse events in those receiving placebo was reported.
13554,1437,"CONCLUSION: Patients with SLE and associated SS treated with epratuzumab showed improvement in SLE disease activity, which was associated with bioactivity, such as decreases in B cell number and IgM level."
13555,1438,PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of technetium 99m pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy in patients with certain salivary gland diseases.
13556,1438,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 47 patients: 25 with chronic obstructive parotitis, 12 with sialolithiasis, and 10 with Sjgren syndrome."
13557,1438,All of the patients underwent preoperative (99m)Tc-pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy.
13558,1438,"Patients with chronic obstructive parotitis also underwent ultrasonography, sialography, and sialoendoscopy; patients with sialolithiasis also underwent ultrasonography and computed tomography; and patients with Sjgren syndrome also underwent ultrasonography and sialography."
13559,1438,We made comparisons between (99m)Tc-pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy and the other aforementioned diagnostic tests to investigate the role of (99m)Tc-pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy in diseases of the salivary glands.
13560,1438,"RESULTS: In patients with chronic obstructive parotitis, (99m)Tc-pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy showed reduced excretion by the affected glands, whereas uptake was nearly normal."
13561,1438,"Among patients with sialolithiasis, (99m)Tc-pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy showed reduced excretion by the affected glands and decreased uptake in 5 patients."
13562,1438,"In patients with Sjgren syndrome, (99m)Tc-pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy showed a decrease in both excretion and uptake by the 4 glands."
13563,1438,CONCLUSIONS: Technetium 99m pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy played a substantial role in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of salivary gland diseases.
13564,1439,"To reveal dental implants survival rates in patients with oral mucosal diseases: oral lichen planus (OLP), Sjgren's syndrome (SjS), epidermolysis bullosa (EB) and systemic sclerosis (SSc)."
13565,1439,"A systematic literature search using PubMed/Medline and Embase databases, utilising MeSH and search term combinations identified publications on clinical use implant-prosthetic rehabilitation in patients with OLP, SjS, EB, SSc reporting on study design, number, gender and age of patients, follow-up period exceeding 12 months, implant survival rate, published in English between 1980 and May 2015."
13566,1439,"After a mean observation period (mOP) of 539 months (standard deviation [SD] 183), 191 implants in 57 patients with OLP showed a survival rate (SR) of 953% (SD 212)."
13567,1439,"For 17 patients with SjS (121 implants, mOP 486  287 months), 28 patients with EB (165 implants, mOP 383  169 months) and five patients with SSc (38 implants, mOP 383  169 months), the respective SR was 917  597% (SjS), 985  27% (EB) and 974  48% (SSc)."
13568,1439,Heterogeneity of data structure and quality of reporting outcomes did not allow for further comparative data analysis.
13569,1439,"For implant-prosthetic rehabilitation of patients suffering from OLP, SjS, EB and SSc, no evidence-based treatment guidelines are presently available."
13570,1439,"However, no strict contraindication for the placement of implants seems to be justified in patients with OLP, SjS, EB nor SSc."
13571,1439,Implant survival rates are comparable to those of patients without oral mucosal diseases.
13572,1439,Treatment guidelines as for dental implantation in patients with healthy oral mucosa should be followed.
13573,1440,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the clinical and laboratory characteristics of Sjgren's syndrome-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SS/SLE), focusing on the possible risk factors of SS that allow development to SLE."
13574,1440,"METHODS: The experimental group included 55 SS/SLE patients, and the control group included 55 primary SS (pSS) patients recruited from our department between 1997 and 2012."
13575,1440,"RESULTS: Compared with the control group, SS/SLE patients showed a younger age of onset of SS (31  12 vs. 39  11 years, P = 0.001)."
13576,1440,"In clinical characteristics, SS/SLE patients showed a lower frequency of xerostomia (78.2% vs. 96.4%, P = 0.016) and interstitial lung disease (27.3% vs. 54.5%, P = 0.004), and a higher frequency of arthritis (74.5% vs. 40.0%, P = 0.000)."
13577,1440,"In laboratory characteristics, SS/SLE patients showed a higher frequency of leukopenia (56.4% vs. 29.1%, P = 0.004), proteinuria (27.3% vs. 7.3%, P = 0.009), and low complement levels (CH50 : 30.9% vs. 1.8%; C3 : 54.5% vs. 12.7%; C4: 41.8% vs. 7.3%, P = 0.000)."
13578,1440,"The multivariate analysis using logistic regression revealed that age of onset, low levels of C3 and C4 were the independent risk factors of SS/SLE (age of onset: RR = 0.919, P = 0.000; low C3 levels: RR = 9.659, P = 0.000; low C4 levels: RR = 6.035, P = 0.007)."
13579,1440,"CONCLUSION: The SS/SLE patients had an earlier age of onset, higher incidences of arthritis, leucopenia, proteinuria and low complement levels, and lower incidences of xerostomia and interstitial lung disease compared with pSS patients."
13580,1440,"These results suggest that we should be vigilant with the pSS patients who have all these mentioned clinical and laboratory characteristics, and are more likely to develop SS/SLE."
13581,1441,BACKGROUND: Renal involvement is rare in primary Sjgren syndrome (PSS).
13582,1441,"In this study, we examined renal biopsy findings in patients with PSS and correlated them with their clinical and renal findings."
13583,1441,METHODS: Twenty-five patients with PSS who underwent renal biopsies from two renal units in Scotland between 1978 and 2013 were identified from renal biopsy database.
13584,1441,"We examined the renal morphologic, clinical and renal findings at the time of renal biopsy, renal and patient outcomes."
13585,1441,RESULTS: The diagnosis of PSS preceded renal biopsy in 18/25 patients.
13586,1441,"In this group, the median duration of the disease was 5.5 years."
13587,1441,"Significant proteinuria, combined microscopic haematuria and proteinuria and reduced renal excretory function were found in 76, 56 and 84% of patients, respectively."
13588,1441,"The 3-year actuarial patient survival was significantly lower in patients with glomerulonephritis as compared with tubulointerstitial nephritis (66 versus 100%, P = 0.02)."
13589,1441,"There was no difference in 3-year actuarial renal survival between these two groups (92 versus 92%, P = 1.0)."
13590,1441,CONCLUSIONS: Renal biopsy is rare in PSS and often reveals diverse pathological findings.
13591,1441,"Glomerulonephritis, as compared with tubulointerstitial nephritis, is associated with higher early mortality."
13592,1441,Further studies are needed to evaluate the utility of renal biopsy and its impact on disease management.
13593,1442,"BACKGROUND: P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), trigger of acute inflammatory responses via the NLRP3 inflammasome, is hyperfunctioning in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS), where it stimulates IL-18 production."
13594,1442,Some patients with SS develop a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (MALT-NHL).
13595,1442,OBJECTIVES: To prospectively evaluate the involvement and the putative prognostic role of this inflammatory pathway in the development of MALT-NHL.
13596,1442,"METHODS: A total of 147 women with SS have been prospectively followed for a mean of 52 months, relating the expression and function of the P2X7R-inflammasome axis in salivary glands and circulating lymphomonocytes to the prognosis and the degree of the disease."
13597,1442,"RESULTS: At baseline, gene expression of P2X7R and of the inflammasome components NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-18 increased according to the presence of germinative centres and was higher in autoantibody-positive individuals and strongly higher in those developing a MALT-NHL over the follow-up."
13598,1442,Glandular expression of IL-18 was threefold higher in MALT-NHL than in controls or in the other patients with SS.
13599,1442,"P2X7R did not colocalize with generic markers of inflammatory infiltrate, like CD20, being selectively expressed by epithelial cells."
13600,1442,"P2X4R, sharing functional characteristics with P2X7R, did not differ in SS and controls."
13601,1442,"The increased P2X7R gene and protein expression was tissue specific, no difference being observed in peripheral lymphomonocytes between SS with MALT-NHL and SS not developing MALT-NHL."
13602,1442,"CONCLUSION: We propose the P2X7R-inflammasome axis as a novel potential pathway involved in both SS exocrinopathy and lymphomagenesis, reinforcing the hypothesis of a key role of IL-18, via its increased P2X7R-mediated production, in the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative malignancies, and opening novel opportunities for the early diagnosis of lymphoproliferative complications and the development of potential targeted therapies."
13603,1443,"Although costimulatory molecules have been shown to play crucial roles in the immune response, their involvement in the pathogenesis of Sjgren's syndrome is incompletely understood."
13604,1443,"In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the severity of spontaneous Sjgren's syndrome-like autoimmune sialadenitis in MRL/MpJ-lpr/lpr (MRL-Fas(lpr)) mice and the expression of 6 costimulatory molecules that play important roles in the immune response: CD80, CD86, OX40 ligand (OX40L), 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL), glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor-related protein ligand (GITRL), and B cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF)."
13605,1443,Expression of the costimulatory molecules in the submandibular salivary glands of age-matched autoimmune MRL-Fas(lpr) mice and non-autoimmune MRL/MpJ-+/+(MRL/+) and C3H/HeJ-lpr/lpr (C3H-Fas(lpr)) mice was examined immunohistochemically and scored on a scale of 0 to 3.
13606,1443,The severity of sialadenitis was evaluated histologically and scored on a scale of 0 to 3.
13607,1443,"We found that all of the costimulatory molecules were expressed in duct epithelial cells of salivary glands from MRL-Fas(lpr) mice, whereas immunoreactivity was absent or weak in the MRL/+ mice."
13608,1443,The staining intensity for all 6 costimulatory molecules was significantly higher in the MRL-Fas(lpr) than in the MRL/+ mice.
13609,1443,"Partial correlation analysis was performed to assess the degree of association between costimulatory molecule staining scores and disease scores, which clearly revealed a significant correlation for only GITRL and 4-1BBL."
13610,1443,"These molecules showed negligible immunoreactivity in the submandibular glands of C3H-Fas(lpr) mice, suggesting that their expression was independent of the Fas(lpr) mutation."
13611,1443,"In conclusion, the expression of GITRL and 4-1BBL in salivary gland duct epithelial cells is associated with background genes in the MRL strain, but not with the Fas(lpr) mutation itself, and contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of autoimmune sialadenitis in MRL-Fas(lpr) mice."
13612,1443,These results suggest that GITRL and 4-1BBL may be effective targets for the development of therapies for Sjgren's syndrome.
13613,1444,BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by exocrine gland and extraglandular symptoms.
13614,1444,We present a case report of pSS with an initial presentation of athetoid movements.
13615,1444,CASE REPORT: A 74-year-old female presented with a 2-month history of slow undulating movements in her trunk and thighs that eventually spread to her neck and lower extremities.
13616,1444,"She also reported dry eyes, dry mouth, as well as pain in her shoulders and thighs."
13617,1444,Her proinflammatory markers and rheumatologic profile were positive.
13618,1444,Her salivary gland biopsy revealed a Focus score > 2.
13619,1444,Brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal.
13620,1444,A diagnosis of pSS was made.
13621,1444,"The patient's symptoms improved with hydroxychloroquine, pilocarpine, gabapentin, and clonazepam."
13622,1444,DISCUSSION: Clinicians should consider and screen for primary autoimmune disorders as a cause of subacute athetoid movements in elderly patients.
13623,1444,"Although aggressive treatment has been recommended, treatment should be tailored to each patient's specific needs."
13624,1445,"OBJECTIVE: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) patients may be affected by the neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), a severe demyelinating syndrome associated with anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies (anti-AQP-4 antibodies)."
13625,1445,The relationship between SS and NMOSD has been a sustained focus of investigation.
13626,1445,"Among SS patients, anti-AQP-4 antibodies have been detected exclusively in those with NMOSD."
13627,1445,It has therefore been speculated that NMOSD is not a neurologic complication of SS.
13628,1445,"However, such studies evaluated small numbers of SS patients, often mixed with other inflammatory disorders."
13629,1445,"METHODS: We compared frequencies of anti-AQP-4 and SS-associated antibodies in 109 SS patients, including 11 with NMOSD, 8 with non-NMOSD demyelinating syndromes, and 90 without demyelinating syndromes."
13630,1445,"RESULTS: When assessed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) assay, anti-AQP-4 antibodies were seen exclusively in those SS patients with NMOSD (72.7%), but not in SS patients without NMOSD (P<0.01)."
13631,1445,"In contrast, anti-Ro 52, anti-Ro 60, and other autoantibodies were not more prevalent in SS patients with NMOSD versus those without."
13632,1445,"Anti-AQP-4 antibodies were detected more frequently among NMOSD patients by FACS assay than with a commercial immunohistochemical assay (72.7% versus 54.5%), despite assessment after a more prolonged period of immunosuppressive therapy (median 38 months versus 5 months; P<0.01)."
13633,1445,"CONCLUSION: The syndrome-specificity of anti-AQP-4 antibodies, along with an otherwise similar antibody profile in SS NMOSD patients, indicates that NMOSD is not a direct central nervous system manifestation of SS."
13634,1445,Anti-AQP-4 antibodies can persist and be refractory to prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.
13635,1446,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, and inflammation is highly associated with atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk."
13636,1446,Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and arterial stiffness measurements are commonly used to detect subclinical atherosclerosis.
13637,1446,"The aim of this study was to non-invasively demonstrate the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with pSS through these measurements, using ultrasound (US) radiofrequency (RF) data technology."
13638,1446,30 pSS patients as the study group and 30 age-and sex-matched healthy volunteers as the control group were included in this study.
13639,1446,"The age of the participants in the entire sample ranged from 18 to 60years, and no primary cardiovascular risk factors were present, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or obesity."
13640,1446,The participants in the study and control groups were evaluated with doppler ultrasonography.
13641,1446,Arterial stiffness and CIMT measurements were made from the bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA) using US RF data technology.
13642,1446,"No statistically significant difference was identified between the patients with pSS and the controls in terms of the right, left, and mean CCA IMT; the right side distensibility coefficient (DC) and compliance coefficient (CC); or the right- and left-side  and  stiffness indices values (p>0.05)."
13643,1446,"Compared to the control subjects, the pSS patients had higher right and left side pulsed wave velocity (PWV), the mean value of the right and the left sides  stiffness index,  stiffness index, and PWV (p<0.05)."
13644,1446,"The pSS patients' left DC, left CC, and the mean value of the right and left sides DC and CC were lower than controls (p<0,05)."
13645,1446,It was found that patients with pSS show evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis.
13646,1446,"To determine this situation in patients with pSS, CIMT and PWV measurements may serve as a guide."
13647,1446,Radiofrequency data technology represents a non-invasive approach to the accurate and quantitative measurement of CIMT elevation and decreases in vascular elasticity.
13648,1447,Connective tissue disorders commonly involve multiple organ systems including the skin and eye.
13649,1447,The pathogenesis of many of these disorders affects the microvasculature in these organs.
13650,1447,"Redness, dryness, pain, and vision loss might be signs of ocular disease in a patient with connective tissue disease."
13651,1447,Ocular involvement can potentially lead to blindness and indicate systemic involvement.
13652,1447,"Dermatologists should be aware of potential ocular involvement in cutaneous connective tissue disorders, and their recognition should prompt ophthalmologic evaluation."
13653,1448,"Recently, we revealed the importance of follicular helper T cells (T(FH)) in the pathogenesis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
13654,1448,"In the present study, we focused on the site of the inflammation and determined the composition of lymphocyte infiltration in labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsies with special emphasis on T(FH) and germinal center B cells."
13655,1448,We selected tissue blocks obtained from ten patients at the time of disease onset.
13656,1448,Detection of cell specific markers was performed with immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence stainings.
13657,1448,We evaluated patients' clinical and laboratory features retrospectively and assessed the relation between disease course and early histopathological findings.
13658,1448,LSG biopsies were graded based on the extension and arrangement level of periductal inflammatory cell infiltrates.
13659,1448,"T(FH) cell markers (CD84, PD-1, and Bcl-6) occurred predominantly in more organized structures with higher focus scores."
13660,1448,The coexpression of CD3 and Bcl-6 markers clearly identified T(FH) cells close to Bcl-6(+) B cells with the typical formation of germinal centers.
13661,1448,Systemic features were developed later in the disease course only in patients with highly structured infiltrates and the presence of T(FH) cells.
13662,1448,Our observations suggest that the presence of T(FH) cells in LSGs at the disease onset may predict a more pronounced clinical course of pSS.
13663,1449,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of baminercept, a lymphotoxin  receptor IgG fusion protein (LTR-Ig), for the treatment of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS), and to explore the possible mechanisms of action of this treatment."
13664,1449,"METHODS: In this multicenter trial, 52 patients with primary SS were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous injections of 100 mg of baminercept every week for 24 weeks or matching placebo."
13665,1449,The primary end point was the change between screening and week 24 in the stimulated whole salivary flow (SWSF) rate.
13666,1449,"Secondary end points included the European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), as well as measurements of select chemokines and cytokines and enumeration of peripheral blood B and T cell subsets."
13667,1449,RESULTS: The change from baseline to week 24 in the SWSF rate was not significantly different between the baminercept and placebo treatment groups (baseline-adjusted mean change -0.01 versus 0.07 ml/minute; P = 0.332).
13668,1449,The change in the ESSDAI during treatment was also not significantly different between the treatment groups (baseline-adjusted mean change -1.23 versus -0.15; P = 0.104).
13669,1449,"Although the incidence of adverse events was similar between the treatment groups, baminercept therapy was associated with a higher incidence of liver toxicity, including 2 serious adverse events."
13670,1449,"Baminercept also produced a significant decrease in plasma levels of CXCL13 and significant changes in the number of circulating B and T cells, consistent with its known inhibitory effects on LTR signaling."
13671,1449,"CONCLUSION: In this trial, treatment with baminercept failed to significantly improve glandular and extraglandular disease in patients with primary SS, despite evidence from mechanistic studies showing that it blocks LTR signaling."
13672,1450,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ianalumab (VAY736), a B cell-depleting, B cell activating factor receptor-blocking, monoclonal antibody, in patients with active primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II, single-centre study."
13673,1450,"METHODS: Patients with pSS, EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) 6, were randomised to ianalumab single infusion at either 3 mg/kg (n=6), 10 mg/kg (n=12) or placebo (n=9)."
13674,1450,"Outcomes were measured blinded at baseline and weeks 6, 12, 24, and unblinded at end of study (EoS) when B cell numbers had recovered."
13675,1450,"Clinical outcomes included ESSDAI, EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), salivary flow rate, ocular staining score, physician global assessment and patient assessments of fatigue and general quality of life."
13676,1450,Laboratory-based measures included circulating leucocyte subsets and markers of B cell activity.
13677,1450,"RESULTS: A similar trend showing positive therapeutic effect by ianalumab was observed across the primary clinical outcome (ESSDAI) and all secondary clinical outcomes (ESSPRI, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, Short Form-36, global assessments by physician and patient) versus the placebo-treated group."
13678,1450,Rapid and profound B cell depletion of long-lasting duration occurred after a single infusion of ianalumab at either dose.
13679,1450,"Serum Ig light chains decreased, with return to baseline levels at EoS."
13680,1450,Changes in some clinical outcomes persisted through to EoS in the higher dose group.
13681,1450,Adverse effects were largely limited to mild to moderate infusion reactions within 24 hours of ianalumab administration.
13682,1450,CONCLUSIONS: Overall results in this single-dose study suggest potent and sustained B cell depletion by ianalumab could provide therapeutic benefits in patients with pSS without major side effects.
13683,1451,BACKGROUND: Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) is usually a systemic disorder characterised by non-amyloid monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain deposition in tissues.
13684,1451,"Localised nodular pulmonary (NP) LCDD is a rare and poorly characterised entity and, owing to the difficulties in diagnosis, limited data are available."
13685,1451,"METHODS: We investigated the clinical, radiological and pathological characteristics of a series of six confidently diagnosed cases of NPLCDD."
13686,1451,RESULTS: There were three men and three women with ages ranging from 33 to 74years.
13687,1451,"In all cases there were single or multiple pulmonary nodules, in one case associated with cysts."
13688,1451,"Two patients had no previous history of a lymphoproliferative or autoimmune disorder, two had Sjgren syndrome (SS) and two had extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma)."
13689,1451,"Lung biopsies led to diagnoses of MALT lymphoma in four patients, including both of those with a previous history of lymphoma and one with SS."
13690,1451,In five cases the diagnosis was confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and in one by electron microscopy.
13691,1451,There was no evidence of systemic LCDD in any of the cases.
13692,1451,"Five patients had an indolent course in spite of limited therapeutic intervention while, in the patient who died, the cause of death was related to the spread of the lymphoma and was not due to the pulmonary lesions."
13693,1451,"CONCLUSIONS: NPLCDD is an indolent disease, in most cases associated with MALT lymphoma or autoimmune disease."
13694,1452,CD4+ T cells constitute the majority of infiltrating cells in salivary glands and lachrymal glands of patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
13695,1452,"The pathophysiology of SS involves T cell recognition of antigens through the T cell antigen receptor, which triggers cytokine production and chronic inflammation."
13696,1452,"The M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3R) molecule is expressed in exocrine glands, such as salivary glands and lachrymal glands, and plays an important role in exocrine secretion."
13697,1452,Previous studies indicated the presence of M3R reactive T cells in peripheral blood of 40% of patients with SS and autoantibodies against M3R in sera of 9-100% of the same patients.
13698,1452,"Thus, M3R is considered a candidate receptor for autoantigen recognition by T and B cells."
13699,1452,"The relationship between B cell epitopes and the function of anti-M3R antibodies has been reported, suggesting the pathogenic role of anti-M3R antibodies in xerostomia commonly seen in SS patients."
13700,1452,"We generated new experimental mouse model, M3R-induced sialadenitis (MIS), using Rag1(-/-) mice inoculated with splenocytes from M3R(-/-) mice immunized with M3R synthetic peptides."
13701,1452,Mice with MIS developed severe SS-like sialadenitis.
13702,1452,Cell transfer experiments using M3R(-/-)xIFN(-/-) mice and M3R(-/-)xIL-17(-/-) mice showed that IFN and IL-17 are key cytokines in the pathogenesis of sialadenitis.
13703,1452,"These findings indicate the crucial roles of M3R-reactive Th1 and Th17 cells in autoimmune sialadenitis, and suggest that these cells, in addition to anti-M3R antibodies, are potential targets in new treatments for SS."
13704,1453,An 81-year-old Japanese male with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) developed a low-grade fever and productive cough which were refractory to antibiotic therapy.
13705,1453,"Based on the high level of eosinophils observed in his bronchial alveolar lavage, he was diagnosed with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) and successfully treated by oral prednisolone."
13706,1453,"Interstitial lung diseases associated with pSS (pSS-ILDs) usually present as nonspecific interstitial pneumonia or usual interstitial pneumonia; therefore, the present case is extremely unique in that the patient's condition was complicated with CEP."
13707,1453,"A diagnosis of advanced gallbladder cancer was made in the patient's clinical course, suggesting the advisability of a whole-body workup in cases of pSS, especially in elderly patients."
13708,1454,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the saliva levels of CXCL13, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL12 and CCL5 in patients with primary SS (pSS), patients with associated SS (aSS), patients with systemic autoimmune disease (SAD) without SS, pre-clinical SS and healthy controls."
13709,1454,"METHODS: We included 44 patients with pSS (Group A), 30 with aSS (Group B), 49 with SAD without SS (Group C), 14 patients with SAD and focal lip infiltrates, but who do not fulfil SS criteria (Group D, pre-clinical SS) and 32 healthy controls (Group E)."
13710,1454,Saliva samples were collected and analysed for chemokine levels by luminometry.
13711,1454,We used descriptive statistics and the Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskall-Wallis test.
13712,1454,RESULTS: All the studied chemokines were found at low concentration in controls with the exception of CCL2.
13713,1454,Patients with pSS had higher levels CXCL10 and CCL2 than controls (P = 0.05).
13714,1454,"However, they had similar levels of CXCL13, CCL5, CXCL12, CCL2 and CXCL10 than patients with aSS and SAD without SS."
13715,1454,"Patients with pre-clinical SS had higher levels of CXCL10 than patients with pSS (P = 0.03), aSS (P = 0.04) and controls (P = 0.001)."
13716,1454,CCL2 levels were higher in all patients with an autoimmune background when compared with controls (P < 0.05 for each comparison).
13717,1454,CONCLUSION: We found no difference in salivary chemokines between patients neither with pSS or aSS nor in patients with SAD.
13718,1454,CCL2 and CXCL10 were increased in all patients with an autoimmune background.
13719,1454,"CXCL10 was notably increased in pre-clinical SS, suggesting it could be an early inflammatory salivary biomarker."
13720,1455,Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a multisystem vasculitic disorder which can commonly afflict various components of the eye.
13721,1455,Here we describe some unusual ocular manifestations of the disease in one patient.
13722,1455,"A young male with history of upper respiratory tract symptoms including epistaxis, nasal stuffiness and maxillary sinus pain presented with bilateral lacrimal gland abscess and ptosis."
13723,1455,Lacrimal gland biopsy revealed granulomatous vasculitis.
13724,1455,"Lung cavities, positive cytoplasmic-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and high titers of serine proteinase-3 antibodies confirmed the diagnosis of WG."
13725,1455,The patient developed dry eyes after a month of first presentation.
13726,1455,"There was no dryness of mouth, suggesting the absence of salivary gland involvement, and antinuclear antibodies as well as antibodies against Ro and La antigens classical of primary Sjogren's syndrome were absent."
13727,1455,Granulomatous vasculitis of lacrimal gland leading to abscess formation and dryness of eyes has not been described in WG and reflects the aggressive nature of inflammatory process in this disease.
13728,1456,OBJECTIVE: Ultrasonography is the first examination performed for screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) can help discriminate between HCC and other lesions.
13729,1456,"Primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL), even if rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of focal liver lesions (FLLs)."
13730,1456,Few data are available in the literature about the role of CEUS in the diagnosis of PHL; we tried to determine whether CEUS could have a role in this setting.
13731,1456,METHODS: we describe 2 cases of primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the liver associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
13732,1456,"The first patient was a 62-year-old man who was an HBV-inactive carrier, and the second was a 58-year-old man with type 2 diabetes and chronic HBV hepatitis."
13733,1456,"RESULTS: in both cases, ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic liver lesion (4 and 3 cm, respectively) with irregular margins in segment 4 of the liver."
13734,1456,"On CEUS, these lesions were inhomogeneously hyperenhanced in the arterial phase and hypoenhanced in the portal and late phases."
13735,1456,Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in both patients showed slight hyperenhancement in the arterial phase and hypoenhancement in the remaining phases.
13736,1456,Needle biopsy showed marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type in both patients.
13737,1456,"CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography and CT did not help us differentiate PHL from HCC; in fact, in both cases we saw the characteristic findings of primary HCC."
13738,1456,"Primary hepatic lymphoma is a rare condition, but it should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of FLLs."
13739,1456,We stress the important role of liver biopsy when imaging indicates HCC in patients without underlying cirrhosis.
13740,1457,BACKGROUND: Sjgrens syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease that is characterised by decreased exocrine gland function and frequent ocular symptoms associated with eye dryness.
13741,1457,"Significantly, dry eyes can lead to corneal abrasions, infection, ulceration, chronic scarring and, in severe cases, perforation."
13742,1457,The available conventional therapies have limited efficacy and there are no biologic therapies licensed for use in SS patients.
13743,1457,MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search of PubMed (MEDLINE) and EMBASE electronic data bases was performed covering the period from January 1994 to September 2014.
13744,1457,"Evidence was graded in categories I-IV and a treatment algorithm, comprising first line, second line and rescue therapies for ocular dryness associated with SS was proposed."
13745,1457,It is based on the current evidence of efficacy of different therapies and explores their link with the pathogenesis of ocular dryness associated with SS.
13746,1457,"RESULTS: Recent developments in the understanding of the pathogenesis of SS provided evidence that the ocular dryness is associated with pathologic infiltration and dysfunction of the lacrimal glands and changes in the tear composition, together with abnormalities involving the neurosecreting circuits."
13747,1457,"There is good evidence for the efficacy of topical artificial tears, antiinflammatories and Cyclosporine, and oral Pilocarpine and Cevimeline in controlling the symptoms of ocular dryness associated with SS."
13748,1457,"CONCLUSIONS: Conventional DMARDs are not particularly effective in addressing the symptoms of ocular dryness associated with SS, despite being commonly prescribed for other SS manifestations."
13749,1457,Emerging evidence suggests that B cell and co-stimulatory targeted therapy may play a role in the future.
13750,1458,OBJECTIVE: Cognitive dysfunction is common in both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
13751,1458,Antibodies against the NR2 subtype of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NR2 antibodies) cause hippocampal atrophy and cognitive impairment in mice and have been associated with memory impairment in both patients with SLE and patients with primary SS.
13752,1458,"In addition, a reduced volume of hippocampal gray matter has been demonstrated in both SLE and primary SS."
13753,1458,This study was undertaken to investigate whether there is a connection between the presence of anti-NR2 antibodies and hippocampal atrophy in human diseases.
13754,1458,METHODS: Fifty patients with SLE and 50 patients with primary SS underwent clinical examination and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging.
13755,1458,"Anti-NR2 antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured, and hippocampal gray matter volumes were compared between patients who were positive for and those who were negative for anti-NR2 antibodies."
13756,1458,RESULTS: Patients with anti-NR2 antibodies in CSF had less hippocampal gray matter than patients without these antibodies.
13757,1458,No other differences regarding gray matter volumes in other parts of the brain were identified.
13758,1458,"CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that anti-NR2 antibodies in patients with SLE and primary SS cause neuronal death manifested as reduced hippocampal gray matter, as has been previously demonstrated in mice with autoimmune disease."
13759,1459,"IMPORTANCE: Primary Sjgren syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by mouth and eye dryness, pain, and fatigue."
13760,1459,Hydroxychloroquine is the most frequently prescribed immunosuppressant for the syndrome.
13761,1459,"However, evidence regarding its efficacy is limited."
13762,1459,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the main symptoms of primary Sjgren syndrome: dryness, pain, and fatigue."
13763,1459,"DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From April 2008 to May 2011, 120 patients with primary Sjgren syndrome according to American-European Consensus Group Criteria from 15 university hospitals in France were randomized in a double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial."
13764,1459,"Participants were assessed at baseline, week 12, week 24 (primary outcome), and week 48."
13765,1459,"The last follow-up date for the last patient was May 15, 2012."
13766,1459,INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/d) or placebo until week 24.
13767,1459,All patients were prescribed hydroxychloroquine between weeks 24 and 48.
13768,1459,"MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a 30% or greater reduction between weeks 0 and 24 in scores on 2 of 3 numeric analog scales (from 0 [best] to 10 [worst]) evaluating dryness, pain, and fatigue."
13769,1459,"RESULTS: At 24 weeks, the proportion of patients meeting the primary end point was 17.9% (10/56) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 17.2% (11/64) in the placebo group (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.37-2.78; P=.98)."
13770,1459,"Between weeks 0 and 24, the mean (SD) numeric analog scale score for dryness changed from 6.38 (2.14) to 5.85 (2.57) in the placebo group and 6.53 (1.97) to 6.22 (1.87) in the hydroxychloroquine group."
13771,1459,The mean (SD) numeric analog scale score for pain changed from 4.92 (2.94) to 5.08 (2.48) in the placebo group and 5.09 (3.06) to 4.59 (2.90) in the hydroxychloroquine group.
13772,1459,The mean (SD) numeric analog scale for fatigue changed from 6.26 (2.27) to 5.72 (2.38) in the placebo group and 6.00 (2.52) to 5.94 (2.40) in the hydroxychloroquine group.
13773,1459,All but 1 patient in the hydroxychloroquine group had detectable blood levels of the drug.
13774,1459,"Hydroxychloroquine had no efficacy in patients with anti-SSA autoantibodies, high IgG levels, or systemic involvement."
13775,1459,"During the first 24 weeks, there were 2 serious adverse events in the hydroxychloroquine group and 3 in the placebo group; in the last 24 weeks, there were 3 serious adverse events in the hydroxychloroquine group and 4 in the placebo group."
13776,1459,"CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with primary Sjgren syndrome, the use of hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo did not improve symptoms during 24 weeks of treatment."
13777,1459,Further studies are needed to evaluate longer-term outcomes.
13778,1459,TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00632866.
13779,1460,"Proteomic techniques have become popular in medicine and dentistry because of their widespread use in analyzing bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine, and gingival crevicular fluids as well as hard tissues such as enamel, dentine, and cementum."
13780,1460,"This review is a guide to proteomic techniques in general dentistry, summarizing techniques and their clinical application in understanding and diagnosing diseases and their use in identifying biomarkers of various diseases."
13781,1461,We report a case of multiple dermatofibromas in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjgren's syndrome.
13782,1461,"He was treated with prednisolone, diaphenylsulfone, and cyclosporine for SLE."
13783,1461,He noticed two brown nodules on his right lower leg 3 years after the first consultation.
13784,1461,"Subsequently, six nodules developed within 6 months, and 2 more nodules after 10 months."
13785,1461,"Histopathological examination of a nodule on his left hand showed fibrotic proliferation with a storiform pattern in the whole dermis, but neither necrosis nor mitosis was observed."
13786,1461,"From these findings, a diagnosis of multiple dermatofibromas was made."
13787,1461,"As these tumors appeared during the remission stage of SLE, they might have been under immunosuppressive conditions caused by immunosuppressing agents rather than collagen disease itself."
13788,1462,"INTRODUCTION: Thymomas, benign or malignant, may be associated with autoimmune diseases."
13789,1462,"They are classically associated with myasthenia gravis, neuromyotonia, or pure red cell aplasia."
13790,1462,"CASE REPORT: We here report, to the best of our knowledge, the first description of an association between thymoma and Reynolds syndrome (systemic sclerosis associated with primary biliary cirrhosis) in an 80-year-old woman."
13791,1462,CONCLUSION: The suspected pathogenesis of this association could be a thymus escape of auto-reactive T lymphocytes and the consecutive development of an auto-immune disorder.
13792,1463,A 61-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of muscle paralysis and was found to have severe hypokalemia.
13793,1463,"A gallium-67 scintigram revealed a positive accumulation in the bilateral salivary glands, and a labial minor salivary gland biopsy demonstrated a massive lymphocyte infiltrate around the salivary ducts."
13794,1463,She was diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) associated with renal tubular acidosis.
13795,1463,Renal biopsy revealed tubulointerstitial nephritis with a mild focal infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells.
13796,1463,These pathological features were compatible with SS with renal involvement.
13797,1463,"Acidosis and hypokalemia were corrected with sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride, which relieved the patient's symptoms."
13798,1463,"Although steroid therapy has been reported to be effective in SS-associated tubulointerstitial nephritis, the patient's serum potassium level could be controlled without administering steroids during the first admission."
13799,1463,"Five years later, she was admitted again because of severe liver dysfunction attributed to autoimmune hepatitis."
13800,1463,"Oral administration of prednisolone resulted in the normalization of her transaminase levels, and the control of her serum potassium level became easier."
13801,1463,"It has been reported that patients with SS with salivary gland involvement tend to have hepatic complications, and those with hepatic complications tend to have renal involvement."
13802,1463,"Physicians should be aware of hepatic involvement, even if there is no liver dysfunction at the initial diagnosis of SS with salivary gland and renal involvement."
13803,1463,It remains uncertain whether the administration of a low dose of steroids before the onset of autoimmune hepatitis might have prevented the development of liver dysfunction in our patient.
13804,1464,PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase subunits in the lacrimal glands (LGs) of rabbits with induced autoimmune dacryoadenitis (IAD) changes.
13805,1464,METHODS: LGs were obtained from adult female rabbits with IAD and age-matched female control rabbits.
13806,1464,"The LGs were processed for laser capture microdissection (LCM), real time RT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence for the detection of mRNA and proteins of the 1, 2, 1, 2, and 3 subunits of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase."
13807,1464,"RESULTS: In the rabbits with IAD, mRNA levels of 1, 1, and 3 from whole LGs were significantly lower."
13808,1464,"In samples of acini and epithelial cells from various duct segments, collected by LCM, mRNA levels of 1, 1, 2, and 3 were significantly lower in the rabbits with IAD, although mRNA for 2 could not be detected."
13809,1464,"However, western blots demonstrated that all five subunits were significantly higher in the rabbits with IAD, although their distribution patterns were similar to those of the control rabbits, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence."
13810,1464,"CONCLUSIONS: The data presented herein demonstrated significant changes in mRNA and protein expressions of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase subunits in rabbits with IAD, suggesting that these changes may play a role in the pathogenesis of Sjgren's syndrome and altered LG secretion, as observed in these animals."
13811,1465,OBJECTIVE: A prevailing hypothesis for neuropsychiatric involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjgren's syndrome is that brain reactive autoantibodies enter the brain through a disrupted blood-brain barrier.
13812,1465,"Our aim was to investigate whether TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) plays a role in cerebral involvement in human SLE and primary Sjgren's syndrome, and whether an impaired blood-brain barrier is a prerequisite for neuropsychiatric manifestations."
13813,1465,"METHODS: TWEAK was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum and compared with markers of blood-brain barrier permeability (Q-albumin and MRI contrast-enhanced lesions) and S100B, an astrocyte activation marker in 50 SLE and 52 primary Sjgren's syndrome patients."
13814,1465,"Furthermore, we estimated the general intrathecal B-cell activation (IgG index), measured anti-NR2 antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid, and explored whether these variables were associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations."
13815,1465,RESULTS: No associations were found between TWEAK in the cerebrospinal fluid or serum and neuropsychiatric manifestations in SLE nor in primary Sjgren's syndrome patients.
13816,1465,"Furthermore, no associations were found between neuropsychiatric manifestations and indicators of blood-brain barrier integrity or astroglial activity."
13817,1465,"Anti-NR2 antibodies were associated with impaired visuospatial processing (odds ratio 4.9, P=0.03) and motor functioning (odds ratio 6.0, P=0.006)."
13818,1465,"CONCLUSION: No clinical neuropsychiatric manifestations could be attributed to impaired integrity of the blood-brain barrier, or to TWEAK levels in cerebrospinal fluid or serum in either patient group."
13819,1465,"The TWEAK concentration was considerably higher in the cerebrospinal fluid than in blood, which indicates intrathecal production."
13820,1465,We hypothesize that increased TWEAK and S100B result from immunological stress caused by brain-reactive antibodies produced by brain residing immune cells.
13821,1466,OBJECTIVE: To determine whether certain rheumatic diseases will affect the fetal thymus diameter when compared to uncomplicated singleton pregnancies.
13822,1466,"Additionally, we created a reference chart for fetal thymus size in healthy singleton pregnancies from 19 to 37 weeks of gestation."
13823,1466,"METHODS: Sonographic fetal thymus size was retrospectively evaluated in 190 healthy pregnant women, and 84 pregnancies of mothers suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), or Sjgren's syndrome between 19 and 37 weeks of gestation."
13824,1466,These fetuses were matched one-to-one for gestational age with control fetuses.
13825,1466,The thymic-thoracic ratio (TT-ratio) was defined as the quotient of the anteroposterior thymic and the intrathoracic mediastinal diameter.
13826,1466,"RESULTS: Rheumatic diseases often affect pregnancy outcome, especially in case of primary APS."
13827,1466,The TT ratio of fetuses of mothers suffering from rheumatic disease was equal to controls (P=0.807).
13828,1466,CONCLUSIONS: Ours is the first study to assess the correlation of fetal thymus size in high-risk pregnancies with rheumatic diseases in comparison to controls.
13829,1466,Women with rheumatic diseases deal with pregnancy complications more frequently than controls.
13830,1466,Our data suggest that maternal rheumatic diseases do not affect the fetal thymus size.
13831,1467,The diagnosis and treatment of patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS) with neuropathic pain pose several challenges.
13832,1467,"Patients with SS may experience unorthodox patterns of burning pain not conforming to a traditional ""stocking-and-glove"" distribution, which can affect the face, torso, and proximal extremities."
13833,1467,This distribution of neuropathic pain may reflect mechanisms targeting the proximal-most element of the peripheral nervous system-the dorsal root ganglia (DRG).
13834,1467,Skin biopsy can diagnose such a small-fiber neuropathy and is a surrogate marker of DRG neuronal cell loss.
13835,1467,"However, SS patients have been reported who have similar patterns of proximal neuropathic pain, despite having normal skin biopsy studies."
13836,1467,"In such cases, DRGs may be targeted by mechanisms not associated with neuronal cell loss."
13837,1467,"Therefore, alternative approaches are warranted to help characterize abnormal DRGs in SS patients with proximal neuropathic pain.We performed a systematic review of the literature to define the frequency and spectrum of SS peripheral neuropathies, and to better understand the attribution of SS neuropathic pain to peripheral neuropathies."
13838,1467,"We found that the frequency of SS neuropathic pain exceeded the prevalence of peripheral neuropathies, and that painful peripheral neuropathies occurred less frequently than neuropathies not always associated with pain."
13839,1467,We developed a novel magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) protocol to evaluate DRG abnormalities.
13840,1467,"Ten SS patients with proximal neuropathic pain were evaluated by this MRN protocol, as well as by punch skin biopsies evaluating for intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) of unmyelinated nerves."
13841,1467,Five patients had radiographic evidence of DRG abnormalities.
13842,1467,"Patients with MRN DRG abnormalities had increased IENFD of unmyelinated nerves compared to patients without MRN DRG abnormalities (30.2 [interquartile range, 4.4] fibers/mm vs. 11.0 [4.1] fibers/mm, respectively; p = 0.03)."
13843,1467,Two of these 5 SS patients whose neuropathic pain resolved with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy had improvement of MRN DRG abnormalities.We have developed a novel MRN protocol that can detect DRG abnormalities in SS patients with neuropathic pain who do not have markers of peripheral neuropathy.
13844,1467,"We found that SS patients with MRN DRG abnormalities had statistically significant, increased IENFD on skin biopsy studies, which may suggest a relationship between trophic mediators and neuropathic pain."
13845,1467,"Given that our literature review has demonstrated that many SS neuropathic pain patients do not have a neuropathy, our findings suggest an important niche for this MRN DRG technique in the evaluation of broader subsets of SS neuropathic pain patients who may not have underlying neuropathies."
13846,1467,"The improvement of MRN DRG abnormalities in patients with IVIg-induced remission of neuropathic pain suggests that our MRN protocol may be capturing reversible, immune-mediated mechanisms targeting the DRG."
13847,1468,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is characterized by B cell hyperactivation, production of autoantibodies and increased risk of B cell lymphomas."
13848,1468,"Serological profile of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation and increase EBV DNA levels in exocrine glands are observed in pSS, but whether these abnormalities are accompanied with disturbed systemic EBV control or have any association with pSS activity remains to be investigated."
13849,1468,"In this observational study, we initially explored anti-EBV antibodies and cell-free DNA in 395 samples from a cross-sectional plasma collection of pSS patients included in ASSESS French national cohort."
13850,1468,Results were assessed in relation with disease activity.
13851,1468,"Further, to assess cell-associated EBV DNA we organized a case-control study including 20 blood samples from pSS patients followed in University Hospital Center of Montpellier."
13852,1468,Results were compared with matched controls.
13853,1468,"Robust response against EBV early antigen (EA) was observed in pSS patients with anti-SSA/B (Sjgren's syndrome A and B) and anti-SSA autoantibodies compared to anti-SSA/B negatives (P < 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively)."
13854,1468,"Increased beta-2 microglobulin, kappa and lambda light chains, and immunoglobulin G levels were more frequently observed in anti-EA seropositive pSS subjects compared to anti-EA negative subjects (P < 0.001; P = 0.001; P = 0.003, respectively)."
13855,1468,Beta-2 microglobulin was independently associated with anti-EA positivity in multivariate analysis (P < 0.001).
13856,1468,Plasma cell-free EBV DNA and EBV cellular reservoir was not different between pSS patients and controls.
13857,1468,We conclude that serological evidence of EBV reactivation was more frequently observed and more strongly associated with anti-SSA/B status and B cell activation markers in pSS.
13858,1468,"However, serological profile of EBV reactivation was not accompanied by molecular evidence of systemic EBV reactivation."
13859,1468,Our data indicated that EBV infection remains efficiently controlled in the blood of pSS patients.
13860,1469,To clarify clinical characteristics of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) subsets associated with autoimmune diseases (AIDs).Five thousand five hundred twenty patients were reviewed retrospectively.
13861,1469,One hundred four ITP patients were included for analysis.
13862,1469,Clinical manifestations at first thrombocytopenic episode were recorded.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjogren syndrome (pSS) accounted for a large part in AIDs associated with secondary ITP.
13863,1469,"SLE-ITP, pSS-ITP, and primary ITP (pITP) patients were different in several aspects in clinical and immunological characteristics."
13864,1469,"A subgroup of patients in pITP patients with some obvious autoimmune features (defined as AIF-ITP) such as positive ANA but failing to meet the diagnosis criteria now used for a specific kind of connective tissue diseases were also different with other pITP patients in some immunological features, indicating the difference in the pathogenesis mechanism of those autoimmune featured ITP patients.ITP patients were heterogeneous in clinical characteristics."
13865,1469,Further study about the different pathogenesis of ITP subsets especially those AIF-ITP patients who only presented with thrombocytopenia will help us have a better understanding of pathogenesis of ITP and a better management of ITP patients.
13866,1470,"SS is an autoimmune condition characterized by exocrine gland destruction, autoantibody production, immune complex deposition and systemic complications associated with lymphocytic infiltration of many organs."
13867,1470,"Genetic, environmental and viral factors play a role in disease aetiology, however, the exact mechanisms driving the immunopathogenesis of SS remain uncertain."
13868,1470,"Here we discuss a role for B cell activating factor (BAFF), whereby B cell hyperactivity and increased BAFF secretion observed in patients and animal models of the disease can be explained by the altered expression of cell-specific BAFF/BAFF receptor (BAFF-R) variants in several immune cell types."
13869,1470,Understanding the role of BAFF/BAFF-R heterogeneity in SS pathogenesis could help to facilitate new treatment strategies for patients.
13870,1471,Renal involvement in the form of glomerulonephritis in Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is less common and usually a latent sequel in the course of the disease.
13871,1471,"We report a patient with Type III membarnoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with hypothyroidism, which precedes the onset of the clinical manifestation of SS."
13872,1471,She received immunosuppressions consisting of i.v.
13873,1471,cyclophosphamide and high-dose corticosteroid and subsequently oral corticosteroid resulting in complete remission of nephrotic syndrome.
13874,1471,"To our knowledge, this is the first report of successfully treated Type III MPGN associated with SS."
13875,1472,AIMS: To test the hypothesis that the expression of aquaporins (AQPs) 4 and 5 is altered in the lacrimal glands (LG) of rabbits with induced autoimmune dacryoadenitis (IAD).
13876,1472,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: LGs were obtained from adult female rabbits with IAD, and age-matched female control rabbits."
13877,1472,"LGs were processed for laser capture microdissection (LCM), real time RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence for the detection and quantification of protein and mRNAs of AQP4 and AQP5 in whole LGs, and purified acinar cells and duct cells from specific duct segments."
13878,1472,"RESULTS: In rabbits with IAD, abundances of mRNAs for AQP4 and AQP5 from whole LGs were significantly lower than controls."
13879,1472,Levels of mRNA for AQP4 were lower in most duct segments from rabbits with IAD.
13880,1472,"However, the mRNA abundance for AQP5 was significantly lower in acini from rabbits with IAD, while its abundance was higher in each duct segment."
13881,1472,"Western blot showed that the expression of AQP4 in LGs from rabbits with IAD was 36% more abundant than normal controls, whereas AQP5 was 72% less abundant."
13882,1472,"Immunofluorescence indicated that AQP4 immunoreactivity (AQP4-IR) was present on the basolateral membranes of acinar and ductal cells in control and diseased LGs, with ductal cells showing stronger AQP4-IR than acinar cells."
13883,1472,"AQP5-IR was found on apical and basolateral membranes of acinar cells, and showed a ""mosaic"" pattern, i.e., with some acini and/or acinar cells showing stronger AQP5-IR than others."
13884,1472,"Minimal AQP5-IR was detected in ductal cells from control animals, while its intensity was significantly increased in rabbits with IAD."
13885,1472,"CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly support our hypothesis that expressions of AQPs are altered in rabbits with IAD, and that specific ductal segment play important roles in lacrimal secretion."
13886,1473,A 53-year-old female developed epigastric discomfort and back pain in 2007.
13887,1473,Diagnostic imaging studies demonstrated a soft tissue tumor with heterogeneous enhancement in the anterior mediastinum and multiple nodules in the right lung.
13888,1473,She underwent expanded thymectomy with subtotal resection of the right lung.
13889,1473,The pathological diagnosis was primary thymic mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.
13890,1473,"The patient complained of ocular discomfort, oral dryness and continuous nasal bleeding in 2007."
13891,1473,Detailed examination led to a diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome and acquired von Willebrand syndrome.
13892,1473,Rituximab treatment for residual disease achieved not only a reduction of the lung MALT lymphoma but also clinical and hematological remission of both syndromes.
13893,1473,"This is, to our knowledge, the first reported case of primary thymic MALT lymphoma accompanied by Sjgren and acquired von Willebrand syndromes."
13894,1474,OBJECTIVE: To examine amount of CD4+CXCR5+Tfh cells and B cells subsets in salivary gland and peripheral blood from patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) and to analyze whether the frequency of CD4+CXCR5+Tfh cells is associated with pSS pathologic process.
13895,1474,METHODS: The percentages of CD4+CXCR5+Tfh cells and B cell subsets were examined by flow cytometry.
13896,1474,"B-lymphocyte chemoattraetant (BLC; also called CXCL13), IL-21, IL-6 from the serum of pSS patients was assessed by polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)."
13897,1474,"RESULTS: The percentages of CD4+CXCR5+Tfh cells in peripheral blood were increased in pSS patients, but decreased after treatment with glucocorticoid and/or immunosuppressive drugs."
13898,1474,Abnormal B cell subsets appeared in salivary and peripheral blood of pSS patients.
13899,1474,The frequency of salivary CD4+CXCR5+Tfh cells was positively correlated with CD19+CD27+ memory B cells and CD19+CD27high plasma cells.
13900,1474,Also increase of salivary CD19+CD27high plasma cells was positively associated with serum ANA titer of pSS patients.
13901,1474,"CONCLUSIONS: CD4+CXCR5+Tfh cells are significantly increased in salivary and peripheral blood in pSS patients with aberrant CD19+CD27+ memory B cells and CD19+CD27high plasma cells, suggesting that CD4+CXCR5+Tfh cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of pSS by promoting the maturation of B cells."
13902,1475,OBJECTIVE: To survey ophthalmologists about current practice patterns regarding the evaluation of dry eye patients and referrals for a Sjogren syndrome (SS) workup.
13903,1475,METHODS: An online survey was sent to ophthalmologists affiliated with the Scheie Eye Institute or Wills Eye Hospital using REDCap in August 2015.
13904,1475,Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data.
13905,1475,RESULTS: Four hundred seventy-four survey invitations were sent out and 101 (21%) ophthalmologists completed the survey.
13906,1475,The common traditional dry eye test performed was corneal fluorescein staining (62%) and the most common newer dry eye test performed was tear osmolarity (18%).
13907,1475,"Half of respondents (51%) refer fewer than 5% of their dry eye patients for SS workups, with 18% reporting that they never refer any patients."
13908,1475,"The most common reasons for referrals included positive review of systems (60%), severe dry eye symptoms (51%) or ocular signs (47%), or dry eye that is refractory to treatment (42%)."
13909,1475,The majority (83%) felt that there is a need for an evidence-based standardized screening tool for dry eye patients to decide who should be referred for evaluation for SS.
13910,1475,"CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmologists continue to prefer the use of traditional dry eye tests in practice, with the most common test being corneal fluorescein staining."
13911,1475,"There is an underreferral of dry eye patients for SS workups, which is contributing to the continued underdiagnosis of the disease."
13912,1475,Most respondents felt that there was a need for an evidence-based standardized screening tool to decide which dry eye patients should be referred for SS evaluations.
13913,1476,"INTRODUCTION: Primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS) affects exocrine glands such as those producing the tear film, leading to dry and painful eyes, but is also associated with fatigue."
13914,1476,"The experience of fatigue in pSS, and its relationship with sicca symptoms, is poorly understood."
13915,1476,METHODS: Twenty people diagnosed with pSS were recruited to participate in a semi-structured qualitative interview about their symptoms experience.
13916,1476,"Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis."
13917,1476,"RESULTS: People with pSS described physical tiredness, mental fatigue and ocular fatigue."
13918,1476,"Mental fatigue was characterised by difficulties in attention, particularly, the ability to follow conversations and short-term memory problems."
13919,1476,"Participants linked their experience of fatigue to feeling of depression, frustration, irritation and anxiety, and therefore, fatigue was suggested to have had a large impact on their psychological well-being."
13920,1476,"People with pSS also described a range of ocular symptoms including pain, dryness, and itching, which were compounded by fatigue."
13921,1476,"For some, eye fatigue was pervasive, and daily activities involving the eyes such as reading, using the computer and driving were impaired."
13922,1476,"In some cases, the level of ocular discomfort was so severe it prevented sleep, which in turn impacted on general fatigue levels."
13923,1476,"CONCLUSIONS: People with pSS experience fatigue in a range of ways; physical, mental and ocular fatigue were described."
13924,1476,"Fatigue was suggested to exacerbate other ocular symptoms, posed serious physical limitations and caused psychological distress."
13925,1476,Further research into the nature of fatigue and ocular symptoms in pSS is required.
13926,1477,"INTRODUCTION: B cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) play a crucial role in B cell development, survival, and antibody production."
13927,1477,Here we analyzed the serum levels of BAFF and APRIL and their respective clinical associations in patients with an immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related disease (IgG4-RD).
13928,1477,"METHODS: We measured serum levels of BAFF and APRIL in patients with IgG4-RD, primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), and healthy individuals."
13929,1477,"Serum BAFF and APRIL levels in IgG4-RD were assessed for correlations with serological parameters, including Ig, particularly IgG4, and the number of affected organs."
13930,1477,Serum BAFF and APRIL levels in IgG4-RD were monitored during glucocorticoid (GC) therapy.
13931,1477,RESULTS: Serum BAFF and APRIL levels in patients with IgG4-RD were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than in healthy individuals.
13932,1477,The BAFF levels of patients with IgG4-RD were comparable to those of patients with pSS.
13933,1477,"Although clinical parameters, such as serum IgG4 and the number of affected organs, were not correlated with the levels of BAFF, serum APRIL levels were inversely correlated with serum IgG4 levels (r = -0.626, P < 0.05)."
13934,1477,"While serum BAFF levels decreased following GC therapy, serum APRIL levels increased during follow-up."
13935,1477,CONCLUSION: These results indicate that BAFF and APRIL might be useful markers for predicting disease activity in IgG4-RD.
13936,1477,Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of BAFF and APRIL in the pathogenesis of IgG4-RD.
13937,1478,The relationship between Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is not completely understood.
13938,1478,"We report two patients with both conditions and review 47 other previously reported cases meeting currently accepted diagnostic criteria, from 17 articles extracted from PubMed."
13939,1478,"Out of 44 patients whose gender was informed, 42 were females."
13940,1478,Mean age at onset of neurological manifestation was 36.2 years (10-74).
13941,1478,"Serum anti-AQP4-IgG was positive in 32 patients, borderline in 1, and negative in 4."
13942,1478,Our Case 1 was seronegative for AQP4-IgG and had no non-organ-specific autoantibodies other than anti-SSB antibodies.
13943,1478,"Our Case 2 had serum anti-AQP4, anti-SSA/SSB, anti-thyreoglobulin and anti-acethylcholine-receptor antibodies, as well as clinical hypothyreoidism, but no evidence of myasthenia gravis."
13944,1478,"Our Cases and others, as previously reported in literature, with similar heterogeneous autoimmune response to aquaporin-4, suggest that SS and NMO co-exist in a common autoimmune milieu which is not dependent on aquaporin-4 autoimmunity."
13945,1479,"Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) usually occurs as an isolated condition, but it may occur in association with another autoimmune disorder such as Sjgren's syndrome."
13946,1479,We reviewed sIBM cases with Sjgren's syndrome (sIBM/SS) from the Perth Inflammatory Myopathies Database to determine whether they are distinguishable from other sIBM cases.
13947,1479,"Six such cases were identified, representing 12% of all sIBM cases."
13948,1479,Muscle biopsies confirmed the presence of an inflammatory myopathy with rimmed vacuoles and the characteristic muscle fibre inclusions of sIBM.
13949,1479,"Five of the six were females, contrasting with a 2:1 male preponderance in the rest of the sIBM cohort."
13950,1479,The mean age-at-onset and the pattern of muscle weakness were similar in the two groups.
13951,1479,"Four out of five sIBM/SS patients treated with immune therapies had improvement in muscle strength lasting for 6-24 months, whereas only 27% of other sIBM patients improved."
13952,1479,"All 6 patients with sIBM/SS carried the HLA-DRB1*0301 allele, or its equivalent HLA-DR3 serological specificity, compared with 83% of other sIBM cases and all carried some or all of the major markers of the 8.1 MHC ancestral haplotype which is also associated with Sjgren's syndrome."
13953,1479,"Patients with sIBM/SS represent a subgroup of sIBM cases who are more likely to be female and carriers of HLA-DR3 and the 8.1 MHC ancestral haplotype, and are more likely to respond to treatment."
13954,1479,The association of sIBM and Sjgren's syndrome is likely to be due to a common genetic predisposition linked to the MHC and supports the notion that sIBM has an autoimmune basis.
13955,1480,The aim of this study was to determine the effect of autologous serum (AS) eye drops on the density of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR-positive epithelial cells and Langerhans cells on the ocular surface of patients with bilateral severe dry eye disease (DED) due to graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
13956,1480,The study was conducted on 24 patients (48 eyes).
13957,1480,AS was applied 6-10 times daily for 3 months together with regular artificial tear therapy.
13958,1480,HLA-DR-positive cells were detected by direct immunocytochemistry on upper bulbar conjunctiva imprints obtained before and after treatment.
13959,1480,The application of AS drops led to a statistically significant increase in the mean density of aberrant HLA-DR-positive conjunctival epithelial cells (p < 0.05) and HLA-DR-positive Langerhans cells (p < 0.05) in the GvHD group.
13960,1480,Aberrant HLA-DR-positive epithelial cells in the SS group were decreased non-significantly.
13961,1480,"All patients reported a significant decrease in the Ocular Surface Disease Index (p < 0.01), which indicates improvement of the patient's subjective feelings after therapy."
13962,1480,There was an expected but non-significant decrease of aberrant HLA-DR-positive conjunctival epithelial cells in the SS group only.
13963,1480,"However, the increased density of HLA-DR-positive cells, indicating slight subclinical inflammation, does not outweigh the positive effect of AS in patients with DED from GvHD."
13964,1481,Saliva is one of the components for the digestive homeostasis.
13965,1481,Recent studies have shown that patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) present a drop in salivary pH.
13966,1481,Patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) are a potential clinical research model for xerostomia and its laryngeal and pharyngeal consequences.
13967,1481,The aim was to evaluate the characteristics of saliva of patients with SS and LPR.
13968,1481,"METHODS: 19 patients with SS plus LPR, and 12 healthy controls had their saliva studied prospectively for volume and pH."
13969,1481,Two salivary samples were obtained from each participant: whole unstimulated saliva(WUS) and whole stimulated saliva(WSS) while chewing parafilm M. All the participants were females.
13970,1481,RESULTS: Mean age was 60 years (study group) and 44 years (control).
13971,1481,LPR was diagnosed on all 19 subjects.
13972,1481,"The mean pH of WUS was 7.53 (SS) and 7.57 (controls), raising to 7.87 and 7.83 respectively after stimulation."
13973,1481,"The mean salivary volume of patients with SS was 1.27 mL (WUS) and 3.78 mL (WSS), whereas controls had a significantly higher salivary volume both before and after stimuli."
13974,1481,"CONCLUSION: A very high prevalence of LPR was found in patients with SS, which is probably caused by a uniform drop in salivary volume and all its contents, rather than a specific deficiency in its components, as shown previously in patients without SS."
13975,1482,OBJECTIVES: The proprotein convertase enzyme FURIN is a critical regulator of the anti-inflammatory TGF-1 cytokine and peripheral immune tolerance.
13976,1482,"In T cells, FURIN is co-regulated with IFN- and thus highly expressed in T helper 1 type cells."
13977,1482,"Previous studies have demonstrated that FURIN is upregulated in inflammatory conditions, including atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus."
13978,1482,"Here, we evaluated the levels of FURIN in the plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and in healthy controls."
13979,1482,"METHODS: FURIN plasma levels were determined by ELISA, and the mRNA expression in PBMCs was quantitated using qPCR."
13980,1482,FURIN levels in the plasma were correlated with the clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients.
13981,1482,RESULTS: FURIN was found to be significantly upregulated at both the protein and mRNA level in pSS patients compared to healthy controls.
13982,1482,"In pSS patients, high FURIN protein levels were significantly associated with elevated IFN- levels in the plasma as well as a longer duration of sicca symptoms in the eyes."
13983,1482,"pSS patients with high FURIN levels in their plasma showed a trend towards lower levels of serum beta-2 microglobulin, ESR and a lower systemic disease activity index ESSDAI."
13984,1482,CONCLUSIONS: The proprotein convertase FURIN is significantly upregulated in pSS.
13985,1482,Elevated FURIN levels associate with high levels of the Th1 type cytokine IFN- and long duration of dry eye symptoms.
13986,1482,Patients with high FURIN levels show signs of lower disease activity suggesting that FURIN might have a protective role in pSS.
13987,1483,"BACKGROUND: In the present study, we investigated whether thymosin  (T) in saliva and in minor salivary glands is differentially expressed in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and patients with autoimmune diseases (systemic sclerosis [SSc], systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], and rheumatoid arthritis [RA], with and without sicca syndrome [ss])."
13988,1483,"METHODS: Saliva specimens of nine patients with pSS, seven with ss/SSc, seven with ss/SLE, seven with ss/RA, seven with SSc, seven with SLE, and seven with RA, as well as ten healthy subjects, were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source to investigate the presence and levels of T(4), T(4) sulfoxide, and T(10)."
13989,1483,Immunostaining for T(4) and T(10) was performed on minor salivary glands of patients with pSS and ss.
13990,1483,RESULTS: T(4) levels were statistically higher in patients with pSS with respect to the other subgroups.
13991,1483,"T(10) was detectable in 66.7 % of patients with pSS and in 42.8 % of those with ss/SSc, while T(4) sulfoxide was detectable in 44.4 % of patients with pSS and in 42.9 % of those with ss/SSc."
13992,1483,T(10) and T(4) sulfoxide were not detectable in patients without associated ss and in healthy control subjects.
13993,1483,"Regarding thymosin immunostaining, all patients had immunoreactivity for T(10), and a comparable distribution pattern in the four different subgroups of patients was observed."
13994,1483,"T(4) immunoreactivity was present in patients with ss/SSc and those with ss/SLE, while it was completely absent in patients with pSS and those with ss/RA."
13995,1483,"CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that higher salivary T expression characterizes patients with pSS, while T(4) sulfoxide and T(10) salivary expression was selectively present in patients with sicca symptoms."
13996,1483,"Moreover, at the immunohistochemical level in patients with pSS, minor salivary glands showed a peculiar pattern characterized by immunostaining for T(10) in acinar cells in the absence of any reactivity for T(4)."
13997,1483,"These findings, taken together, suggest a different role for T(4) and T(10) in patients with pSS who have ss and other autoimmune disease."
13998,1484,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prognostic value of the lymphocytic focus score (LFS) and the percentages of IgA+, IgM+ and IgG+ plasma cells for disease severity of primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS)."
13999,1484,"METHODS: Medical charts of 174 pSS patients were retrospectively analysed, comparing histology results (LFS and percentages of IgA+, IgM+ and IgG+ plasma cells) with disease outcomes as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and clinical scores including cumulative EULAR (European League against Rheumatism) Sjgren syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI) and the total number of extraglandular manifestations."
14000,1484,RESULTS: The mean LFS was significantly higher in patients developing NHL (3.00.894 vs 2.251.086; p=0.021).
14001,1484,"The threshold of 3 foci has a positive predictive value of 16% for lymphoma, and a negative predictive value of 98%."
14002,1484,Only LFS 3 contributed significantly and independently to NHL development in a standard multiple regression model.
14003,1484,Ig class distribution of plasma cells did not help to identify patients developing lymphoma.
14004,1484,"Patients with LFS 3, 40% IgA+ or 25% IgM+ plasma cells in salivary gland biopsy specimens had significantly enhanced systemic disease."
14005,1484,CONCLUSIONS: Routine histopathological minor salivary gland assessment has important prognostic value.
14006,1484,The LFS might help to identify patients with an increased risk for lymphoma.
14007,1485,PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) is a frequently devastating clinical syndrome which has come into focus for its association with neuromyelitis optica (NMO).
14008,1485,Recent advances in the diagnosis of NMO have led to very sensitive and specific tests and advances in therapy for this disorder.
14009,1485,"LETM is not pathognomonic of NMO, therefore it is important to investigate for other causes of myelopathy in these patients."
14010,1485,"This review aims to discuss recent advances in NMO diagnosis and treatment, and to discuss the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with LETM."
14011,1485,RECENT FINDINGS: Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and cell binding assays for NMO-IgG are the most sensitive for detecting NMO spectrum disorders.
14012,1485,"Patients who have a clinical presentation of NMO, who have been tested with older ELISA or immunofluorescence assay and been found to be negative, should be retested with a fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay when available, particularly in the presence of recurrent LETM."
14013,1485,"Novel therapeutic strategies for LETM in the context of NMO include eculizumab, which could be considered in patients with active disease who have failed azathioprine and rituximab."
14014,1485,Thorough investigation of patients with LETM who are negative for NMO-IgG may lead to an alternate cause for myelopathy.
14015,1485,SUMMARY: LETM is a heterogeneous condition.
14016,1485,"Novel treatment strategies are available for NMO, but other causes need to be excluded in NMO-IgG-seronegative patients."
14017,1486,BACKGROUND: Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease whose etiology is complicated.
14018,1486,Total glucosides of paeony (TGP) has a variety of pharmacological effects.
14019,1486,PURPOSE: To evaluate the therapeutic effects of TGP on SS in mice and anti-inflammatory mechanism.
14020,1486,STUDY DESIGN: SS animal model was developed from C57BL/6J mice through immunological induction (SS mice) and NOD/ShiltJNju (NOD) mice.
14021,1486,Inflammatory cytokines and other related indicators were measured.
14022,1486,"METHODS: TGP (720, 360, 180mg/kg) was intragastrically administered for 6 or 16 weeks for SS mice and NOD mice, respectively."
14023,1486,"Average food and water intake, average body weight, saliva flow, submandibular gland (SMG) and spleen index, and SMG pathology were measured."
14024,1486,ELISA was used to evaluate serum inflammatory cytokines in SS mice and autoantigens in NOD mice.
14025,1486,"Real-time PCR, Western blot and Luminex liquid suspension chip assay were applied to analyze SMG inflammatory cytokines mRNA and protein expression of NOD mice."
14026,1486,"RESULTS: Compared with SS mice, TGP treatment improved SMG pathological damage."
14027,1486,"TGP (720mg/kg) treatment increased saliva flow, and reduced organ indexes and serum IL-6 and IFN- concentration."
14028,1486,TGP (360mg/kg) treatment decreased serum IFN- concentration.
14029,1486,TGP (180mg/kg) treatment for 6 weeks decreased average body weight.
14030,1486,"Compared with NOD mice, TGP treatment increased saliva flow from 9 to 15 weeks, decreased body weight, and alleviated pathological damage of SMG after 2 and 16 weeks."
14031,1486,"After 2 weeks of administration, TGP treatment inhibited serum concentration of SSB/La, SSA/Ro and -fodrin, decreased TNF-, IL-1 and IFN- in SMG, and down-regulated protein expressions of BAFF and IL-17A and mRNA expressions of BAFF, TNF-, IL-17A, CXCL9 and CXCL13 in SMG."
14032,1486,"After 8 weeks of administration, TGP treatment decreased the concentration of -fodrin in serum, TNF- and IL-6 in SMG, and down-regulated mRNA expressions of IL-17A, TNF-, CXCL9, CXCL13 and BAFF and protein expressions of IL-17A and BAFF in SMG."
14033,1486,"After 16 weeks of administration, TGP treatment reduced serum SSA/Ro, SSB/La and -fodrin concentration, and decreased BAFF protein expression and TNF-, CXCL9, CXCL13, IL-17A, and BAFF mRNA expressions."
14034,1486,CONCLUSION: TGP has a certain therapeutic effect on SS mice and NOD mice through inhibiting inflammatory responses.
14035,1487,RATIONALE: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a rare autoimmune cholestatic liver disease.
14036,1487,It is often associated with extrahepatic autoimmune disorders.
14037,1487,"However, the concurrence of PBC and Sjgren syndrome (SS) with the subsequent onset of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is extremely rare."
14038,1487,"PATIENT CONCERNS: This study investigated a 60-year-old woman admitted to our hospital with complaints of xerostomia for 5 years, pruritus for 3 years, and abnormal liver function for 3 months."
14039,1487,"DIAGNOSES: The patient was suffering from typical clinical PBC and SS, and developed decompensated liver cirrhosis after 32 months of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy."
14040,1487,"In May 2018, she was readmitted to the hospital with a high fever of 39C, coughing, and sever fatigue without remission after 3 days of cephalosporin antibiotic therapy."
14041,1487,"During the clinical course of PBC, her antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) titers fluctuated from 1:1000 to negative and then to weakly positive, determined by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), immunoblotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on recombinant mitochondrial antigens; furthermore, her titers of anti-gp210, an antinuclear antibody (ANA), increased sharply."
14042,1487,Laboratory tests and imaging were performed to diagnose PBC and SS in September 2015.
14043,1487,"However, she was subsequently diagnosed with AIHA after 32 months of UDCA therapy based on the identification of pancytopenia, increased reticulocyte (RET) count, and a positive result from the direct Coombs test."
14044,1487,"INTERVENTIONS: UDCA, hepatic protectant, albumin infusion, chest drainage, rational antibiotic use, diuretics, and methylprednisolone were used to treat the patient."
14045,1487,"OUTCOMES: Liver cirrhosis was complicated by the development of AIHA, which became severe at 42 months of follow-up."
14046,1487,"LESSONS: This is the first case report showing a patient with comorbid PBC and SS, as well as the sequential development of AIHA with decreased AMA and increased anti-gp210 titers; this may have been due to immunodeficiency."
14047,1487,"These findings stress the importance of the serological screening of ANA profile, as well as repeated measurement of ANA and AMA to track PBC progression and prognosis."
14048,1488,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the use of the Clinical EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ClinESSDAI), a version of the ESSDAI without the biological domain, for assessing potential eligibility and outcomes for clinical trials in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), according to the new ACR-EULAR classification criteria, from the UK Primary Sjgren's Syndrome Registry (UKPSSR)."
14049,1488,METHODS: A total of 665 patients from the UKPSSR cohort were analysed at their time of inclusion in the registry.
14050,1488,ESSDAI and ClinESSDAI were calculated for each patient.
14051,1488,"RESULTS: For different disease activity index cut-off values, more potentially eligible participants were found when ClinESSDAI was used than with ESSDAI."
14052,1488,The distribution of patients according to defined disease activity levels did not differ statistically (chi2 p = 0.57) between ESSDAI and ClinESSDAI for moderate disease activity (score 5 and <14; ESSDAI 36.4%; ClinESSDA 36.5%) or high disease activity (score 14; ESSDAI 5.4%; ClinESSDAI 6.8%).
14053,1488,"We did not find significant differences between the indexes in terms of activity levels for individual domains, with the exception of the articular domain."
14054,1488,"We found a good level of agreement between both indexes, and a positive correlation between lymphadenopathy and glandular domains with the use of either index and with different cut-off values."
14055,1488,"With the use of ClinESSDAI, the minimal clinically important improvement value was more often achievable with a one grade improvement of a single domain than with ESSDAI."
14056,1488,We observed similar results when using the new ACR-EULAR classification criteria or the previously used American-European Consensus Group (AECG) classification criteria for pSS.
14057,1488,"CONCLUSIONS: In the UKPSSR population, the use of ClinESSDAI instead of ESSDAI did not lead to significant changes in score distribution, potential eligibility or outcome measurement in trials, or in routine care when immunological tests are not available."
14058,1488,These results need to be confirmed in other cohorts and with longitudinal data.
14059,1489,OBJECTIVE: MicroRNA reflect physiologic and pathologic processes and may be used as biomarkers of concurrent pathophysiologic events in complex settings such as autoimmune diseases.
14060,1489,"We generated microRNA microarray profiles from the minor salivary glands of control subjects without Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and patients with SS who had low-grade or high-grade inflammation and impaired or normal saliva production, to identify microRNA patterns specific to salivary gland inflammation or dysfunction."
14061,1489,METHODS: MicroRNA expression profiles were generated by Agilent microRNA arrays.
14062,1489,We developed a novel method for data normalization by identifying housekeeping microRNA.
14063,1489,MicroRNA profiles were compared by unsupervised mathematical methods to test how well they distinguish between control subjects and various subsets of patients with SS.
14064,1489,Several bioinformatics methods were used to predict the messenger RNA targets of the differentially expressed microRNA.
14065,1489,RESULTS: MicroRNA expression patterns accurately distinguished salivary glands from control subjects and patients with SS who had low-degree or high-degree inflammation.
14066,1489,"Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we validated 2 microRNA as markers of inflammation in an independent cohort."
14067,1489,"Comparing microRNA from patients with preserved or low salivary flow identified a set of differentially expressed microRNA, most of which were up-regulated in the group with decreased salivary gland function, suggesting that the targets of microRNA may have a protective effect on epithelial cells."
14068,1489,The predicted biologic targets of microRNA associated with inflammation or salivary gland dysfunction identified both overlapping and distinct biologic pathways and processes.
14069,1489,"CONCLUSION: Distinct microRNA expression patterns are associated with salivary gland inflammation and dysfunction in patients with SS, and microRNA represent a novel group of potential biomarkers."
14070,1490,RATIONALE: Primary cutaneous amyloidosis (PCA) is a localized skin disorder characterized by the abnormal deposition of amyloid in the extracellular matrix of the dermis.
14071,1490,"The association between PCA and other diseases, although rare, has been documented for various autoimmune diseases."
14072,1490,PCA associated with autoimmune hepatitis-primary biliary cirrhosis (AIH-PBC) overlap syndrome and Sjgren syndrome (SS) has not been previously reported in the literature.
14073,1490,PATIENT CONCERNS: A 50-year-old woman presented with progressive abnormal liver enzyme levels and was referred to our department.
14074,1490,"DIAGNOSES: Due to the patient's symptoms, laboratory test results, radiographic findings, and pathologic results, she was diagnosed with PCA associated with AIH-PBC overlap syndrome and SS."
14075,1490,"INTERVENTIONS: She was subsequently treated with a combination of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), prednisone, and azathioprine."
14076,1490,"OUTCOMES: While this treatment can achieve therapeutic success, it cannot prevent complications from cirrhosis."
14077,1490,This patient remains alive but experienced an emergent gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
14078,1490,"LESSONS: While we acknowledge that this is a single case, these findings extend our knowledge of immunological diseases associated with PCA and suggest a common, immune-mediated pathogenic pathway between PCA, AIH-PBC overlap syndrome, and SS."
14079,1490,"After 12 years of follow up, clinical manifestations have developed, and these autoimmune diseases have progressed."
14080,1490,"The combination of UDCA, prednisone, and azathioprine can achieve therapeutic success but cannot prevent disease progression."
14081,1490,Routine follow up for this patient is necessary to document disease progression.
14082,1491,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to evaluate the prevalence and characterize the main epidemiological, clinical and immunological features of annular erythema (AE) in non-Asian patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
14083,1491,METHODS: We carried out a retrospective study searching for AE in 377 Spanish patients with primary SS fulfilling the 2002 American-European criteria.
14084,1491,"In addition, we searched PubMed (1994-2012) using the MeSH terms ""annular erythema"" and ""primary Sjgren's syndrome"" for additional cases."
14085,1491,All cases with AE reported in patients with SS associated with systemic lupus erythematosus were excluded.
14086,1491,"RESULTS: In our Spanish cohort, we found 35 (9%) patients diagnosed with AE."
14087,1491,"All were white females, with a mean age of 47 years at diagnosis of AE."
14088,1491,AE preceded diagnosis of SS in 27 (77%) patients.
14089,1491,Cutaneous AE lesions involved principally the face and upper extremities.
14090,1491,"All patients reported photosensitivity, with cutaneous flares being reported during the warmest months in 93% of patients."
14091,1491,Immunological markers consisted of anti-Ro/La antibodies in 31 (89%) patients.
14092,1491,"In the literature search, we identified eight additional non-Asian patients with primary SS diagnosed with AE."
14093,1491,"In comparison with 52 Asian patients, the 43 non-Asian patients with AE related to primary SS were more frequently women (100% vs 78%, p=0.008), and cutaneous lesions were less frequently reported in the face (55% vs 81%, p=0.045) and more frequently in the neck (40% vs 14%, p=0.041)."
14094,1491,"Immunologically, non-Asian patients had a lower frequency of anti-Ro antibodies and a higher frequency of negative Ro/La antibodies, although the differences were not statistically significant."
14095,1491,CONCLUSION: AE is not an exclusive cutaneous feature of Asian patients with primary SS.
14096,1491,"In addition to the characteristic cutaneous expression, AE has a very specific clinical and immunological profile: often presenting before the fulfillment of SS criteria, overwhelmingly associated with anti-Ro antibodies but weakly associated with other immunological markers and the main systemic SS-related features."
14097,1492,"OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effect of Chinese herbal medicine for strengthening qi, nourishing yin, and removing stasis on serum osteopontin (OPN) and quality of life (QOL) in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) and to study the correlation between OPN level and the disease."
14098,1492,"METHODS: Sixty-eight pSS patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the treatment group (35 cases) treated by Chinese herbal medicine for strengthening qi, nourishing yin, and removing stasis combined with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablet (HCQ) and the control group (33 cases) treated by HCQ only."
14099,1492,Both were treated for 3 months.
14100,1492,"Before and after treatment, immunoglobulin G (IgG) level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and OPN level were measured."
14101,1492,The QOL in patients was evaluated using the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) before and after treatment.
14102,1492,Thirty healthy females were taken as the normal control.
14103,1492,"RESULTS: Before treatment, levels of IgG, ESR, and OPN in patients were higher than those in the normal control."
14104,1492,"After 3 months of treatment, those in both treatment groups decreased but were lower in the treatment group than those in the control group (P<0.05)."
14105,1492,The scores of 8 dimensions of SF-36 were lower in the pSS patients than those in the normal control (P<0.05) and higher in the treatment group than in the control group after treatment (P<0.05).
14106,1492,"Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the levels of OPN and the levels of IgG and ESR, and a negative correlation between OPN levels and the overall score of SF-36 (P<0.05)."
14107,1492,"CONCLUSIONS: Chinese herbal medicine for strengthening qi, nourishing yin, and removing stasis could alleviate pSS disease and improve the QOL."
14108,1492,"In addition, the OPN level might be used as an evaluating index for pSS disease."
14109,1493,OBJECTIVE: SS is an autoimmune exocrinopathy affecting 1 million patients in the USA that is diagnosed mostly in middle-aged women.
14110,1493,Oral fluids (OFs) serving as the mirror of the body were suggested as an ideal non-invasive diagnostic tool.
14111,1493,Previously we developed depletion techniques for OF high-abundance proteins to increase visualization of low-abundance proteins.
14112,1493,Therefore the aim of this study was to examine the effect of depletion pretreatments on the identification potential of SS OF biomarker candidates.
14113,1493,METHODS: Unstimulated OFs were collected from 18 female SS patients and 18 healthy age- and gender-matched controls.
14114,1493,High-abundance proteins were depleted using affinity and immunodepletion methodologies followed by semi-quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and quantitative dimethylation liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
14115,1493,"To initially validate the MS results, western blotting was performed."
14116,1493,RESULTS: The use of depletion strategy before proteomics analysis increased identification ability by 3-fold.
14117,1493,"Overall, 79 biomarker candidates were identified."
14118,1493,Proteins with the most pronounced fold changes were related to SS serum or tissue factors.
14119,1493,"In addition, bioinformatics analysis of proteins with a >3-fold increase in SS patients showed calcium-binding proteins, defence-response proteins, proteins involved in apoptotic regulation, stress-response proteins and cell motion-related proteins."
14120,1493,Preliminary validation by western blotting of profilin and CA-I indicated similar expression profile trends to those identified by quantitative MS.
14121,1493,CONCLUSION: The significance of OF novel depletion methodologies is clearly demonstrated for increased visibility of biomarker candidates as well as for unveiling possible mechanisms involved in this syndrome.
14122,1493,This represents a major contribution to our ability to use OF as a future diagnostic fluid.
14123,1494,OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
14124,1494,"METHODS: The AutoImmune and Rituximab registry has included 86 patients with pSS treated with rituximab, prospectivey followed up every 6 months for 5 years."
14125,1494,"RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with pSS (11 men, 67 women), who already had at least one follow-up visit, were analysed."
14126,1494,"Median age was 59.8 years (29-83), median duration of disease was 11.9 years (3-32)."
14127,1494,Indications for treatment were systemic involvement for 74 patients and only severe glandular involvement in four patients.
14128,1494,The median European Sjgren's Syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI) was 11 (2-31).
14129,1494,17 patients were concomitantly treated with another immunosuppressant agent.
14130,1494,Median follow-up was 34.9 months (6-81.4) (226 patient-years).
14131,1494,Overall efficacy according to the treating physician was observed in 47 patients (60%) after the first cycle of rituximab.
14132,1494,Median ESSDAI decreased from 11 (2-31) to 7.5 (0-26) (p<0.0001).
14133,1494,Median dosage of corticosteroid decreased from 17.6 mg/day (3-60) to 10.8 mg/day (p=0.1).
14134,1494,Forty-one patients were retreated with rituximab.
14135,1494,Four infusion reactions and one delayed serum sickness-like disease resulted in rituximab discontinuation.
14136,1494,Three serious infections (1.3/100 patient-years) and two cancer-related deaths occurred.
14137,1494,"CONCLUSIONS: In common practice, the use of rituximab in pSS is mostly restricted to patients with systemic involvement."
14138,1494,This prospective study shows good efficacy and tolerance of rituximab in patients with pSS and systemic involvement.
14139,1495,"Although lymphatic neovascularization may be a key feature of chronic inflammation, it is almost unexplored in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
14140,1495,"A recent study revealed a pro-lymphangiogenic function of interleukin (IL)-17, a leading player in pSS pathogenesis."
14141,1495,"The aims of the study were to investigate lymphangiogenic mediators and lymphatic vasculature in pSS, as well as their possible association with IL-17."
14142,1495,Circulating lymphatic endothelial precursor cells (LEPCs) and Th17 cells were enumerated in pSS patients and healthy donors.
14143,1495,VEGF-C and IL-17 levels were assessed in paired serum samples.
14144,1495,"Lymphatic vasculature, VEGF-C/VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-3 and IL-17 were evaluated in pSS minor salivary glands (MSGs) and compared with normal and non-specific chronic sialadenitis (NSCS) MSGs."
14145,1495,"Circulating LEPCs were expanded in pSS and correlated with circulating Th17 cells, IL-17 and VEGF-C."
14146,1495,"In pSS MSGs, a newly formed lymphatic capillary network was found within periductal inflammatory infiltrates and the number of interlobular lymphatic vessels was significantly increased compared with normal and NSCS MSGs."
14147,1495,Strong VEGF-C expression was detected in pSS ductal epithelial cells and periductal inflammatory cells.
14148,1495,Numerous VEGFR-3(+) infiltrating mononuclear cells were exclusively observed in pSS MSGs.
14149,1495,VEGFR-3 expression was strongly increased in lymphatic capillaries of pSS MSGs.
14150,1495,IL-17(+) inflammatory cells were preferentially observed around lymphatic vessels in pSS MSGs.
14151,1495,"This study supports the notion that lymphvasculogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are active in pSS, thereby unmasking a novel aspect of disease pathogenesis."
14152,1495,"In addition, our results suggest another possible pathogenic role of IL-17 in pSS, further supporting its therapeutic targeting in this disease."
14153,1496,Solid phase assays (SPAs) and automated microscope systems are increasingly used to screen for antinuclear antibodies (ANAs).
14154,1496,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of three automated ANA screening assays; NOVA Lite HEp-2 using NOVA View (NV, Inova Diagnostics), an automated indirect immunofluorescence method, EliA CTD Screen (Fluorescence Enzyme Immunoassay, FEIA; Thermo Fisher) and QUANTA Flash CTD Screen Plus (Chemiluminescence immunoassay, CIA; Inova Diagnostics)."
14155,1496,"The assays were performed on 480 diagnostic samples from patients with an ANA-associated rheumatic disease (AARD; systemic lupus erythematosus, primary Sjgren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, inflammatory myopathy, mixed connective tissue disease) and on 767 samples from diseased and healthy controls."
14156,1496,"Using cut-offs proposed by the manufacturers, the sensitivity was 95%, 80.5% and 86% for NV, FEIA and CIA, respectively."
14157,1496,"The corresponding specificity was 61% (NV), 97.5% (FEIA) and 88% (CIA)."
14158,1496,"The sensitivity associated with a specificity of ~95% was 79%, 82% and 78% for NV, FEIA, and CIA, respectively."
14159,1496,Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis revealed no differences in area under the curve (AUC) between the 3 assays when all diseases were grouped.
14160,1496,"For Sjgren's syndrome, the AUC was higher for SPAs than for NV, whereas for systemic sclerosis, the AUC was higher for NV than for CIA."
14161,1496,"For all assays, the likelihood ratio for AARD increased with increasing antibody levels and for double positivity of NV with SPA."
14162,1496,"In conclusion, the performance of automated SPA and IIF was assay- and disease-dependent."
14163,1496,Taking into account antibody levels and combining IIF with SPA adds value.
14164,1497,We present the case of a 71-year-old Japanese woman with Sjgren syndrome complicated with pulmonary amyloidosis who developed microscopic polyangiitis.
14165,1497,"She was admitted because of fever, weight loss, and paresthesia of the plantae and fingers."
14166,1497,Chest computed tomography revealed bilateral multiple nodules with calcification in the lung.
14167,1497,Transbronchial lung biopsy specimens showed AL-type (primary) amyloid deposits.
14168,1497,"The patient also tested positive for myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (MPO-ANCA), with changes in the MPO-ANCA titer that paralleled changes in the symptoms."
14169,1497,Nerve conduction velocity findings showed mononeuropathy multiplex.
14170,1497,"Livedo vasculitis was observed on bilateral lower legs, and skin biopsy showed leukoclastic vasculitis."
14171,1497,We diagnosed the patient as having microscopic polyangiitis.
14172,1498,Antibodies to Ro52/Ro60 (SSA) and La (SSB) are strongly associated to the autoimmune disease primary Sjgren's syndrome and are important in the serologic diagnosis of the disease.
14173,1498,"Several methods for detection of these antibodies exist such as indirect immunofluorescence, commercial western blot kits, in-house assays, and numerous commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)."
14174,1498,"Dependent on the type of assay, sensitivity and specificity may vary notably."
14175,1498,"Especially ELISAs, where the antibody reactivity to synthetic peptides, recombinant or native proteins are determined, are often applied."
14176,1498,This chapter describes detection of SSA and SSB antibodies by ELISA.
14177,1499,A 64-years-old woman with chronic thyroiditis was refered to our hospital because of anterior mediastinum tumors identified by chest computed tomography (CT).
14178,1499,The lesions with increased fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake was noted by CT and positron emission tomography (PET).
14179,1499,"Extended thymo-thymectomy was performed, and the tumors was completely resected."
14180,1499,"Pathologically, the tumors were diagnosed as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue( MALT) lymphoma of the thymus."
14181,1499,Postoperative chemotherapy was not performed and the patient has been well for 4 years without recurrence.
14182,1499,But she has developed the symptoms of Sjgren syndrome 3 years after operation.
14183,1500,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease characterized by progressive destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis."
14184,1500,PBC is known to have both hepatic and extrahepatic manifestations.
14185,1500,"Extrahepatic manifestations are seen in up to 73% of patients with PBC, with the most common being Sjogren's syndrome, thyroid dysfunction and systemic sclerosis."
14186,1500,"It is thought that patients with PBC are at increased risk of developing these extrahepatic manifestations, almost all of which are autoimmune, because patients with autoimmune disease are at higher risk of developing another autoimmune condition."
14187,1500,"Due to the high prevalence of extrahepatic diseases in patients with PBC, it is important to complete a thorough medical history at the time of diagnosis."
14188,1500,Prompt recognition of extrahepatic disease can lead to improved patient outcomes and quality of life.
14189,1500,The following review summarizes the most common extrahepatic conditions associated with PBC.
14190,1501,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) can be complicated by distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), which may contribute to low bone mineral density (BMD)."
14191,1501,Our objective was to evaluate BMD in pSS patients with and without dRTA as compared with healthy controls.
14192,1501,BMD of lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) was measured in 54 pSS patients and 162 healthy age- and sex-matched controls by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
14193,1501,dRTA was defined as inability to reach urinary pH <5.3 after an ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) test.
14194,1501,"LS- and FN-BMD were significantly higher in pSS patients compared with controls (1.180.21g/cm(2) for patients vs. 1.100.18g/cm(2) for controls, P=0.008 and 0.90.16g/cm(2) for patients vs. 0.850.13g/cm(2) for controls, P=0.009, respectively)."
14195,1501,"After adjustment for BMI and smoking, the LS- and FN-BMD remained significantly higher."
14196,1501,"Patients with dRTA (N=15) did not have a significantly different LS- and FN-BMD compared with those without dRTA (N=39) after adjustment for BMI, age, and gender."
14197,1501,Thirty-seven (69%) pSS patients were using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).
14198,1501,"Unexpectedly, pSS patients had a significantly higher LS- and FN-BMD compared with healthy controls."
14199,1501,Patients with dRTA had similar BMD compared with patients without dRTA.
14200,1501,We postulate that an explanation for the higher BMD in pSS patients may be the frequent use of HCQ.
14201,1502,"OBJECTIVE: To observe effect of prescriptions replenishing vital essence, tonifying Qi and activating blood on expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-IP (IL-1beta) in serum and submaxillary gland of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice with Sjogren's syndrome."
14202,1502,"METHOD: Thirty-two NOD mice were divided into four groups at random: the model group, the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) group, the hydroxychloroquine group, the TCM and western medicine (WM) group, with 8 mice in each group."
14203,1502,Eight Balb/C mice were taken as the normal normal control group.
14204,1502,"The TCM group was orally administered with 0.4 mL decoction replenishing vital essence, tonifying Qi and activating blood (100 g x kg(-1)) everyday; the hydroxychloroquine group were given 0.4 mL hydroxychloroquine (60 mg x kg(-1)) everyday; the TCM WM group were given 0.4 mL decoction, replenishing vital essence tonifying Qi and activating blood (50 g x kg(-1)) and hydroxychloroquine (60 mg x kg(-1)) everyday."
14205,1502,"Mice were sacrificed after eight weeks, and their arterial blood and tissues of submaxillary gland were collected."
14206,1502,"The levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta in serum were detected by ELISA."
14207,1502,"Expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta protein in submaxillary gland were detected by immunohisto-chemistry."
14208,1502,"RESULT: Compared with other groups, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta in serum and submaxillary gland in the model group were higher (P < 0.05)."
14209,1502,"The normal group showed lower serum TNF-alpha level than other groups (P < 0.05), but without statistical significance compared with the TCM group."
14210,1502,"IL-1beta in serum in the TCM group and the TCM WM group were lower than that of the hydroxychloroquine group (P < 0.05), but without statistical significance compared with the normal group."
14211,1502,"TNF-alpha protein expression in the TCM group and the TCM WM group showed no significant difference compared with the normal group, whereas the TCM WM group were notably lower than that of the hydroxychloroquine group (P < 0.05)."
14212,1502,IL-1beta expression in the TCM WM group showed no significant difference compared with the normal group.
14213,1502,"CONCLUSION: The decoction replenishing vital essence, tonifying Qi and activating blood can decrease the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta in serum and submaxillary gland of NOD mice with Sjogren's syndrome."
14214,1502,"It may improve pathological damage of submaxillary gland by regulating Th1/Th2 cell factors, in order to achieve the therapeutic effect on SS."
14215,1503,The effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on dry eye has not been fully determined.
14216,1503,This study aimed to compare the 12-week efficacy of HCQ medication with that of a placebo in the management of dry eye in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
14217,1503,"A double-blind, randomized control study was conducted in 39 pSS subjects from May 2011 through August 2013. pSS was diagnosed based on the classification criteria of the American-European Consensus Group."
14218,1503,"Subjects received 300 mg of HCQ or placebo once daily for 12 weeks and were evaluated at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks, with a re-visit at 16 weeks after drug discontinuance."
14219,1503,"The fluorescein staining score, Schirmer test score, tear film break-up time (TBUT), and ocular surface disease index (OSDI) were measured, and tears and blood were collected for ESR, IL-6, IL-17, B-cell activating factor (BAFF), and Th17 cell analysis."
14220,1503,Color testing was performed and the fundus was examined to monitor HCQ complications.
14221,1503,Twenty-six subjects completed the follow-up.
14222,1503,The fluorescein staining score and Schirmer test score did not differ significantly.
14223,1503,The OSDI improved with medication in the HCQ group but was not significantly different between the groups.
14224,1503,"TBUT, serum IL-6, ESR, serum and tear BAFF, and the proportion of Th17 cells did not change in either group."
14225,1503,HCQ at 300 mg daily for 12 weeks has no apparent clinical benefit for dry eye and systemic inflammation in pSS (ClinicalTrials.gov.
14226,1503,NCT01601028).
14227,1504,This case is the first description of the successful anti-B-cell therapy with rituximab in a patient with Sjogren's syndrome and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder in Russia.
14228,1504,This article contains the literature data on clinical manifestations and methods of the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.
14229,1504,"Furthermore, contemporary view on the pathogenesis of the combination of this disease with Sjogren's syndrome are presented here."
14230,1505,OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a major cause of death in connective tissue disease patients.
14231,1505,This study investigated the clinical characteristics and survival of CTD-PAH in Chinese patients.
14232,1505,"METHODS: This cohort study enrolled 190 consecutive PAH patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), or primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) who visited our referral center between May 2006 and December 2014."
14233,1505,"Baseline demographics, clinical features, laboratory results, and hemodynamic assessments were analyzed."
14234,1505,Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with increased risk of mortality.
14235,1505,RESULTS: The PAH patients were more likely to have SLE (58.4%) as the underlying CTD than SSc (26.3%) or pSS (15.3%).
14236,1505,"Mean age was 37.810.4years, and patients with SLE were youngest at the time of PAH diagnosis."
14237,1505,The most prevalent autoantibody was anti-U1RNP antibody (55.8%).
14238,1505,The three groups did not differ significantly regarding World Health Organization functional class or hemodynamic results.
14239,1505,"The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 87.1%, 79.1%, and 62.9%, respectively."
14240,1505,"The 3-year survival rate of 81.3% for those with SLE-PAH was significantly better than that for patients with SSc-PAH (63.6%, P<0.05)."
14241,1505,"Independent predictors of mortality were 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) 380m (HR 3.222, 95% CI 1.485-6.987, P=0.003) and underlying CTD (HR 1.684; 95CI% 1.082-2.622, P=0.021)."
14242,1505,CONCLUSION: Independent predictors of mortality for CTD-PAH were 6MWD <380m and SSc as the underlying CTD.
14243,1505,Increased awareness of pSS-PAH is needed because of its worse prognosis compared to SLE-PAH.
14244,1506,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands, especially the salivary and lacrimal glands."
14245,1506,"As a result of salivary gland dysfunction, most patients with SS have xerostomia, related to a reduced salivary flow rate."
14246,1506,"In addition to the discomfort due to xerostomia, dry mouth can cause various intraoral manifestations such as refractory stomatitis, ulcer and atrophic changes in the oral mucosa and tongue, and patients' quality of life (QOL) is impaired severely."
14247,1506,These manifestations are believed to be caused mainly by a decrease in the clearance in the oral cavity owing to hyposalivation.
14248,1506,"However, since saliva has several beneficial physiological effects on the intraoral environment, qualitative changes in sialochemistry should also be considered a cause of the refractory intraoral manifestations in SS."
14249,1506,"Salivary epidermal growth factor (EGF) is considered an important cytoprotective factor against injuries, and it contributes to wound healing in the oral cavity."
14250,1506,We evaluated changes in salivary EGF levels and assessed the association between salivary EGF levels and the severity of intraoral manifestations in SS patients.
14251,1506,"The results showed that the salivary EGF levels decreased with the progression of SS, and this deterioration in saliva quality as well as hyposalivation could play a role in the pathogenesis of refractory intraoral manifestations in SS patients."
14252,1506,Our findings provide new target for therapeutic intervention in SS.
14253,1507,Sjgren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease associated with inflammation of exocrine glands with clinical manifestations of dry eye and dry mouth.
14254,1507,Dry eye in this disease involves inflammation of the ocular surface tissues - cornea and conjunctiva.
14255,1507,"While systemic blockade of adhesion molecules has been used to treat autoimmune diseases, the purpose of this study was to determine the therapeutic efficacy of topical application of an integrin 4 adhesion molecule antagonist in a mouse model of dry eye associated with Sjgren's syndrome."
14256,1507,To assess this spontaneously developed ocular surface inflammation related to Sjgren's syndrome in TSP-1null mice (12 wks) was evaluated.
14257,1507,Mice were treated with topical formulations containing 0.1% dexamethasone or 30mg/ml GW559090 or vehicle control.
14258,1507,Corneal fluorescein staining and conjunctival goblet cell density were assessed.
14259,1507,Real-time PCR analysis was performed to assess expression of the inflammatory marker IL-1 in the cornea and Tbet and RORt in the draining lymph nodes.
14260,1507,"Ocular surface inflammation was detectable in TSP-1null mice (12 wk old), which resulted in increased corneal fluorescein staining indicative of corneal barrier disruption and reduced conjunctival goblet cell density."
14261,1507,These changes were accompanied by increased corneal expression of IL-1 as compared to WT controls and an altered balance of Th1 (Tbet) and Th17 (RORt) markers in the draining lymph nodes.
14262,1507,"Topically applied dexamethasone and GW559090 significantly reduced corneal fluorescein staining compared to vehicle treatment (p=0.023 and p<0.001, respectively)."
14263,1507,This improved corneal barrier integrity upon adhesion molecule blockade was consistent with significantly reduced corneal expression of pro-inflammatory IL-1 compared to vehicle treated groups (p<0.05 for both treatments).
14264,1507,Significant improvement in goblet cell density was also noted in mice treated with 0.1% dexamethasone and GW559090 (p<0.05 for both).
14265,1507,"We conclude that similar to topical dexamethasone, topically administered GW559090 successfully improved corneal barrier integrity and inflammation in an established ocular surface disease associated with Sjgren's syndrome."
14266,1508,Lacrimal glands of people over 40 years old frequently contain lymphocytic infiltrates.
14267,1508,Relationships between histopathological presentation and physiological dysfunction are not straightforward.
14268,1508,"Data from rabbit studies have suggested that at least two immune cell networks form in healthy lacrimal glands, one responding to environmental dryness, the other to high temperatures."
14269,1508,New findings indicate that mRNAs for several chemokines and cytokines are expressed primarily in epithelial cells; certain others are expressed in both epithelial cells and immune cells.
14270,1508,"Transcript abundances vary substantially across glands from animals that have experienced the same conditions, allowing for correlation analyses, which detect clusters that map to various cell types and to networks of coordinately functioning cells."
14271,1508,"A core network--expressing mRNAs including IL-1, IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-10--expands adaptively with exposure to dryness, suppressing IFN-, but potentially causing physiological dysfunction."
14272,1508,"High temperature elicits concurrent increases of mRNAs for prolactin (PRL), CCL21, and IL-18."
14273,1508,"PRL is associated with crosstalk to IFN-, BAFF, and IL-4."
14274,1508,"The core network reacts to the resulting PRL-BAFF-IL-4 network, creating a profile reminiscent of Sjgren's disease."
14275,1508,"In a warmer, moderately dry setting, PRL-associated increases of IFN- are associated with suppression of IL-10 and augmentations of IL-1 and IL-17, creating a profile reminiscent of severe chronic inflammation."
14276,1509,The variation of saliva composition in different physiological and pathological states is well demonstrated.
14277,1509,"Several saliva constituents (enzymes, hormones, antibodies, cytokines etc.)"
14278,1509,"are up- or down-regulated in respect to benign, premalignant and malignant conditions in the oral cavity, and several patterns of deregulation are associated with specific disorders."
14279,1509,"Omics technologies have contributed significantly in the identification of alterations in gene expression, transcription, protein coding and small molecules concentration, in biologic systems."
14280,1509,"In this aspect, salivaomics integrate these technologies in saliva analysis and represent a novel and holistic approach in oral disease management including diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring."
14281,1509,This review summarizes the current research in the discovery of biomarkers and molecular signatures with diagnostic or prognostic utility for oral diseases in saliva.
14282,1509,The review also focuses on the emerging issues of the salivaomics technology and saliva diagnostics and the translational potential.
14283,1510,BACKGROUND: Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is known to cause HTLV-associated myelopathy (HAM)/tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T cell leukemia.
14284,1510,"A growing body of evidence links HTLV-1 infection with an increasing spectrum of disease, including uveitis, periodontal disease, arthropathy, sicca syndrome, and neurologic deficits."
14285,1510,"OBJECTIVES: Despite recent findings, the natural history of HTLV-1 infection remains poorly defined."
14286,1510,This study was designed to better characterize initial clinical and neurological findings in individuals diagnosed with HTLV-1 infection.
14287,1510,"STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 71 individuals recently diagnosed with HTLV-1 and 71 uninfected age- and sex-matched blood donors in Salvador, Brazil."
14288,1510,Subjects were administered a standardized questionnaire and underwent physical exam.
14289,1510,"RESULTS: HTLV-1 infected subjects were significantly more likely than controls to report complaints of hand and foot numbness (OR=5.3; 95% CI: 1.8-15.3; p=0.002 and OR=4.0; 95% CI: 1.3-12; p=0.013 respectively), difficulty running (OR=4.0; 95% CI: 1.1-14.2; p=0.032), nocturia (OR=5.0; 95% CI: 1.1-22.8; p=0.038), arthralgia (OR=3.3; 95% CI: 1.4-7.7; p=0.006), and photophobia (OR=3.3; 95% CI: 1.4-7.7; p=0.006)."
14290,1510,"CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic, ocular and rheumatologic complaints may be the first manifestations of HTLV-1 infection."
14291,1510,"Therefore, all patients presenting with initial diagnosis should be rigorously screened for these symptoms."
14292,1511,"INTRODUCTION: IL-10-producing B cells, Foxp3-expressing T cells (Tregs) and the IDO-expressing dendritic cells (pDC) are able to modulate inflammatory processes, to induce immunological tolerance and, in turn, to inhibit the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease."
14293,1511,"The aim of the study was to characterize and to enumerate peripheral IL-10--producing B cells, Tregs and pDCregs in primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS) patients in regard of their clinical and serologic activity."
14294,1511,METHODS: Fifty pSS patients and 25 healthy individuals were included in the study.
14295,1511,CD19-expressing peripheral B lymphocytes were purified by positive selection.
14296,1511,"CD19/CD24(hi)/CD38(hi)/IL-10-producing B cells, CD4/CD25(hi)/Foxp3 and CD8/CD28/Foxp3 Tregs, as well as CCR6/CD123/IDO DCs, were quantitated by flow cytometry."
14297,1511,"RESULTS: Immature/transitional circulating IgA IL-10-producing B cells had higher levels in pSS patients versus control group, whereas CD19/CD38(hi)/IgG/IL-10 cells had lower percentage versus control."
14298,1511,"Indeed CD19/CD24(hi)/CD38(hi)/CD5/IL-10, CD19/CD24(hi)/CD38(hi)/CD10/IL-10, CD19/CD24(hi)/CD38(hi)/CD20/IL-10, CD19/CD24(hi)/CD38(hi)/CD27/IL-10, and CD19/CD24(hi)/CD38(hi)/CXCR7/IL-10 cells had higher frequency in clinical inactive pSS patients when compared with control group."
14299,1511,"Remarkably, only percentages of CD19/CD24(hi)/CD38(hi)/CD10/IL-10 and CD19/CD24(hi)/CD38(hi)/CD27/IL-10 subsets were increased in pSS serologic inactive versus control group (P < 0.05)."
14300,1511,The percentage of IDO-expressing pDC cells was higher in pSS patients regardless of their clinical or serologic activity.
14301,1511,There were no statistically significant differences in the percentage of CD4/CD25(hi)/Foxp3 Tregs between patient groups versus controls.
14302,1511,"Nonetheless, a decrease in the frequency of CD8/CD28/Foxp3 Tregs was found in inactive pSS patients versus controls (P < 0.05)."
14303,1511,CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this exploratory study show that clinical inactive pSS patients have an increased frequency of IL-10--producing B cells and IDO-expressing pDC cells.
14304,1512,We describe a case of granuloma annulare (GA) associated with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in a 69-year-old woman.
14305,1512,She complained of erythematous plaques on the left forearm and neck in addition to dry eyes and mouth.
14306,1512,The laboratory and clinical findings also fulfilled the criteria for diagnosis of SS.
14307,1512,Histopathological examination revealed the features of interstitial type GA.
14308,1512,It is not rare that granulomatous diseases are associated with autoimmune diseases.
14309,1512,"This case indicated that granulomatous diseases and SS are closely related and that GA should be recognized as a cutaneous manifestation associated with autoimmune diseases, including SS."
14310,1513,"OBJECTIVE: Muscular impairment is a rare systemic manifestation of SS that is rarely described in the literature and classically non-specific, both clinically and histologically."
14311,1513,We reviewed the cases of 4 patients with primary SS presenting with myositis and a common histologic pattern on muscular biopsy with germinal centre-like structures resembling that which occurs in salivary glands.
14312,1513,METHODS: We analysed the data files of patients with SS who had muscular manifestations and underwent a muscular biopsy.
14313,1513,"Among 23 patients with SS who had muscle biopsies, 13 had non-specific myositis and 10 (4 primary and 6 secondary SS) had a common histologic pattern consisting of germinal centre-like structures."
14314,1513,We analysed the data files of the 4 patients with primary SS presenting with myositis with muscular germinal-centre like structures.
14315,1513,"RESULTS: The 4 patients had an unspecific clinical presentation, with myalgias, muscular weakness and normal or elevated values of CPK."
14316,1513,"In the four patients, SS-associated myositis had common histologic characteristics, with endomysial and perimysial inflammatory infiltrate."
14317,1513,The cellular infiltrate was composed predominantly of CD4+ T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes.
14318,1513,"The B and T CD4+ cells infiltrates may gather into masses, even forming lymphoid follicles."
14319,1513,Three patients were treated with corticosteroids and/or hydroxychloroquine with improvement of myositis and 1 patient was lost to follow-up.
14320,1513,CONCLUSIONS: We describe four patients with a common histologic appearance of myositis with lymphoid follicles associated with primary SS.
14321,1513,"The clinical presentation was non-specific and non-severe, with favorable outcome with corticosteroids and/or hydroxycholoroquine."
14322,1513,The discovery of this particular histologic appearance in a muscle biopsy independent of the final diagnosis should indicate the possibility of SS.
14323,1514,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate rituximab (RTX) in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) with peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement.
14324,1514,METHODS: Patients with pSS and PNS involvement who were included in the French AIR registry were analysed.
14325,1514,RESULTS: 17 patients (age 60 years (44-78 years); 14 were female) were analysed.
14326,1514,Neurological improvement was noted in 11 patients (65%) at 3 months.
14327,1514,"Rankin scale decreased from 3 (1-5) to 2 (1-5), 2 (1-5) and 2 (1-6) after 3, 6 and 9 months (p=0.02)."
14328,1514,"European Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index decreased from 18 (10-44) to 11 (5-20), 11 (5-29) and 12 (5-30) after 3, 6 and 9 months (p<0.05)."
14329,1514,RTX was effective in neurological involvement in 9/10 patients with vasculitis or cryoglobulinaemia (90%) (group 1) at 3 months and in 2/7 cases (29%) without cryoglobulinaemia and vasculitis (p=0.03).
14330,1514,Rankin and European Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index scales decreased significantly in group 1.
14331,1514,CONCLUSION: RTX seems effective in cryoglobulinaemia or vasculitis-related PNS involvement in pSS.
14332,1515,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI can differentiate mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma from benign lymphoepithelial lesion (BLEL) in the parotid gland.
14333,1515,METHODS: 25 patients with tumour-like BLEL and 20 patients with MALT lymphoma in the parotid gland confirmed by pathology were examined pre-operatively using routine MR series and DCE-MRI with a 1.5-T MR unit.
14334,1515,"The time to peak (TTP), time to start (TTS), SIstart, SImax and SIending were measured and the initial slope of increase (ISI) and relative washout ratio (RWO) were calculated separately from the time-intensity curve (TIC), and the types of TIC were analysed."
14335,1515,RESULTS: There were significant differences in the TTP and ISI between the two lesions (p<0.001).
14336,1515,"The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of TTP were all more than 90%."
14337,1515,TICs were divided into three types according to the threshold of TTP and ISI: tumour-like BLEL: gradual type (Type II) and late increase type (Type III); MALT lymphoma: rapid increase and gradual type (Type I).
14338,1515,CONCLUSIONS: DCE-MRI contributed greatly to the differential diagnosis between tumour-like BLEL and MALT lymphoma in the parotid gland.
14339,1516,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of abatacept (CTLA-4Ig), which limits T cell activation, on homeostasis of CD4+ T cell subsets and T cell-dependent B cell hyperactivity in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
14340,1516,METHODS: Fifteen patients with primary SS treated with abatacept were included.
14341,1516,"Circulating CD4+ T cell and B cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry at baseline, during the treatment course, and after treatment was completed."
14342,1516,"CD4+ effector T cell subsets and Treg cells were identified based on expression of CD45RA, CXCR3, CCR6, CCR4, CXCR5, programmed death 1, inducible costimulator (ICOS), and FoxP3."
14343,1516,Serum levels of anti-SSA/anti-SSB and several T cell-related cytokines were measured.
14344,1516,Expression of ICOS and interleukin-21 (IL-21) protein was examined in parotid gland tissue at baseline and after treatment.
14345,1516,Changes in laboratory parameters and associations with systemic disease activity (EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index [ESSDAI]) over time were analyzed using generalized estimating equations.
14346,1516,RESULTS: Abatacept selectively reduced percentages and numbers of circulating follicular helper T (Tfh) cells and Treg cells.
14347,1516,Other CD4+ effector T cell subsets were unaffected.
14348,1516,"Furthermore, expression of the activation marker ICOS by circulating CD4+ T cells and expression of ICOS protein in parotid gland tissue declined."
14349,1516,Reduced ICOS expression on circulating Tfh cells correlated significantly with lower ESSDAI scores during treatment.
14350,1516,"Serum levels of IL-21, CXCL13, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB decreased."
14351,1516,"Among circulating B cells, plasmablasts were decreased by treatment."
14352,1516,"After cessation of treatment, all parameters gradually returned to baseline."
14353,1516,CONCLUSION: Abatacept treatment in patients with primary SS reduces circulating Tfh cell numbers and expression of the activation marker ICOS on T cells.
14354,1516,Lower numbers of activated circulating Tfh cells contribute to attenuated Tfh cell-dependent B cell hyperactivity and may underlie the efficacy of abatacept.
14355,1517,PURPOSE: To study the effects of a low administration rate and low concentration (0.1%) of clobetasone butyrate eyedrops in patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS).
14356,1517,"METHODS: This prospective, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled study included 40 subjects divided into 2 treatment groups: group 1 (2% polyvinylpyrrolidone eyedrops and placebo) and group 2 (2% polyvinylpyrrolidone and 0.1% clobetasone butyrate, 1 drop BID)."
14357,1517,"The treatment lasted for 30 days, with visits at enrollment, baseline, day 15, day 30, and after 15 days of treatment discontinuation."
14358,1517,"At each visit, symptoms questionnaire, tear film break-up time, corneal fluorescein stain, lissamine green stain, conjunctival impression cytology for human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) expression, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, and fundus examination were performed."
14359,1517,RESULTS: No changes in IOP or fundus examination were observed in either group at each time point.
14360,1517,Group 1 patients showed at day 30 a statistically significant amelioration of symptoms and reduction of HLA-DR expression.
14361,1517,No changes in other parameters were detected.
14362,1517,Group 2 patients showed at day 15 a statistically significant improvement of corneal and conjunctival stain versus baseline values and group 1 at the same time; after 30 days the symptoms score was statistically significantly better than baseline values and group 1 at the same time.
14363,1517,The HLA-DR expression and the epithelial cells area were statistically significantly reduced versus baseline and group 1 at the same time.
14364,1517,CONCLUSIONS: Anti-inflammatory therapy is critical for the treatment of SS dry eye.
14365,1517,"Clobetasone butyrate, at low dosage, proved to be safe and effective in treating this condition."
14366,1518,OBJECTIVE: This study examined the application of a simple screening test for salivary gland function by measuring resting and stimulated submandibular and sublingual secretions.
14367,1518,STUDY DESIGN: An assay system was designed to use filter paper incorporating the chromophore of melanoidin or stimuli such as capsaicin and citric acid.
14368,1518,We investigated the relationship between resting and stimulated secretions and melanoidin migration at 2 minutes for healthy and dry mouth groups.
14369,1518,RESULTS: The healthy group showed a significant increase in the migration of melanoidin in the paper after citric acid or capsaicin stimulation.
14370,1518,"In contrast, patients with Sjgren syndrome showed no significant migration in spite of the stimulation."
14371,1518,"However, some participants with Sjgren syndrome or dry mouth showed a significant increase in the migration of melanoidin after stimulation."
14372,1518,CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the newly developed method should be useful for evaluation of residual salivary gland function and screening for hyposalivation with dry mouth.
14373,1519,"Despite recent advancements in the knowledge of the etiology and pathogenic mechanisms, treatment of the autoimmune disease Sjgren's syndrome (SS) remains mostly empiric and symptom-based, indicating the need for novel therapeutic approaches."
14374,1519,Ectodysplasin-A2 (EDA-A2) is a recently isolated member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily that binds to X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR).
14375,1519,"In this report, we have analyzed the expression and the biological activity of EDA-A2 in human salivary gland epithelial cells (SGEC) from primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients."
14376,1519,We report that EDA-A2 and its receptor XEDAR are overexpressed in pSS SGEC in comparison with healthy individuals and that the EDA-A2/XEDAR system in these cells is involved in the induction of apoptosis via caspases activation.
14377,1519,"Collectively, our results suggest that EDA-A2/XEDAR system may be a promising agent for the gene therapy of pSS."
14378,1520,"BACKGROUND: Several factors, including clinical manifestations and laboratory data, have been used to evaluate the disease activity of Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
14379,1520,We investigated saliva indicators of disease activity in primary SS patients.
14380,1520,METHODS: We enrolled 138 Taiwanese patients with primary SS and 100 Taiwanese normal controls.
14381,1520,"Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), and rheumatoid factor (RF)-IgA levels in saliva samples were measured using ELISA or fluorescent enzyme-linked immunoassay."
14382,1520,"Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were measured by nephelometry."
14383,1520,Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was measured with an automatic ESR analyzer.
14384,1520,The t-test and Pearson correlation test were used.
14385,1520,"RESULTS: IL-6 level was higher in primary SS patients than in normal controls (14.2314.77 vs 9.877.32, P=0.012), but there were no significant differences in IL-17A, TNF-, and RF-IgA levels."
14386,1520,"In primary SS patients, IL-6 level correlated weakly with ESR and IgG levels (r=0.252, P=0.015, and r=0.248, P=0.017, respectively), and TNF- level correlated weakly with IgG level (r=0.231, P=0.024)."
14387,1520,CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 may play a role in SS pathogenesis.
14388,1520,Saliva IL-6 might be an indicator of disease activity in primary SS patients.
14389,1521,"OBJECTIVES: To assess whether there are shared exposures associated with Sjogren's syndrome (SS), dry eye syndrome (DES), and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), in order to determine whether they are etiologically related."
14390,1521,"METHODS: In a clinic-based case-control study, 702 participants (91 SS, 120 DES, 211 (age and sex frequency-matched) controls, and 280 B-NHL cases) were recruited and interviewed regarding exposures, medical history, and family history."
14391,1521,RESULTS: Female predominance was noted in SS (ratio 9.2:1).
14392,1521,Eye dryness was severest in SS compared to DES and controls (P < 0.001).
14393,1521,"Compared to controls, alcohol consumption was inversely associated with NHL, DES, and SS (odds ratio (OR) = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.31-0.71; OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.33-0.88; and OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.14-0.49, respectively), while a previous history of infection requiring hospitalization was positively associated with all three conditions: NHL (OR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.23-2.99), DES (OR = 3.29; 95% CI: 1.97-5.47), and SS (OR = 4.74; 95% CI: 2.66-8.44)."
14394,1521,"NHL patients were more likely to report first-degree relatives with hematologic cancer, while having first-degree relatives with an autoimmune disease (AID) was associated with SS (OR = 5.25; 95% CI: 2.59-10.63) and DES (OR = 3.55; 95% CI: 1.83-6.91) compared to controls."
14395,1521,"CONCLUSIONS: Some exposures are associated with all three conditions (such as an inverse association with alcohol consumption and a positive association with serious past infection), while a family history of AID appears to be shared by DES and SS, but not NHL subjects."
14396,1521,Shared risk factors for all three conditions indicate possible mutual etiological pathways.
14397,1522,"We present the case of woman in her 50s who developed numerous red-brown telangiectatic macules on her trunk and extremities, as well as persistent dry eyes and dry mouth."
14398,1522,Skin biopsy was consistent with telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans (TMEP).
14399,1522,Serum tryptase was elevated suggesting systemic involvement.
14400,1522,Anti-Ro and La were negative.
14401,1522,ANA was positive.
14402,1522,Salivary gland biopsy revealed a focus score of 3 and immunostains revealed infiltrates of aberrant CD117 positive mast cells.
14403,1522,This case suggests a mechanistic role of mastocytosis in salivary compromise.
14404,1523,"INTRODUCTION: Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells of the immune system, involved in both initiating immune responses and maintaining tolerance."
14405,1523,"Dysfunctional and via toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands activated DC have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases, but their role in the etiology of Sjgren's syndrome, a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by progressive mononuclear cell infiltration in the exocrine glands, has not been revealed yet."
14406,1523,"Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate phenotype and functional properties of immature and TLR7/8 stimulated monocyte-derived DC (moDC) of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and compare them to healthy controls."
14407,1523,"METHODS: The phenotype, apoptosis susceptibility and endocytic capacity of moDC were analyzed by flow cytometry."
14408,1523,Secretion of cytokines was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and multiplex Luminex analyses in moDC cell culture supernatants.
14409,1523,The expression of TLR7 was analyzed by flow cytometry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
14410,1523,"Expression of Ro/Sjgren's syndrome-associated autoantigen A (Ro52/SSA), interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF-8), Bim, signal transduction and activators of transcription (Stat) 1, p-Stat1 (Tyrosin 701), p-Stat1 (Serin 727), Stat3, pStat3 (Tyrosin 705) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphatase dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was measured by Western blotting."
14411,1523,Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) family members were quantified using the ELISA-based TransAM NF-B family kit.
14412,1523,"RESULTS: We could not detect differences in expression of co-stimulatory molecules and maturation markers such as cluster of differentiation (CD) 86, CD80, CD40 or CD83 on moDC from patients compared to healthy controls."
14413,1523,"Moreover, we could not observe variations in apoptosis susceptibility, Bim and Ro52/SSA expression and the endocytic capacity of the moDC."
14414,1523,"However, we found that moDC from pSS patients expressed increased levels of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR. We also found significant differences in cytokine production by moDC, where increased interleukin (IL)-12p40 secretion in mature pSS moDC correlated with increased RelB expression."
14415,1523,"Strikingly, moDC from pSS patients matured for 48 hours with TLR7/8 ligand CL097 expressed significantly less Stat1."
14416,1523,CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a role for moDC in the pathogenesis of Sjgren's syndrome.
14417,1524,OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate with MRI the involvement of gray matter and white matter structures in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome.
14418,1524,"SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients with primary Sjgren syndrome, 18 age- and disease duration-matched patients with systemic sclerosis, and 35 age-matched control subjects were examined for differences in white matter hyperintensities (WMHIs) detected on FLAIR MR images."
14419,1524,Differences in brain volume between patients with primary Sjgren syndrome and controls were studied by application of voxel-based morphometry to a 3D T1-weighted sequence.
14420,1524,"RESULTS: WMHIs were observed in 38 of the 53 patients with primary Sjgren syndrome, six of 18 patients with systemic sclerosis, and 17 of 35 controls."
14421,1524,"The numbers of WMHIs 2 mm or larger and the number smaller than 2 mm were higher in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome than in controls ( 2 mm, p = 0.004; < 2 mm, p < 0.001)."
14422,1524,No significant difference was observed in the number of WMHIs in primary Sjgren syndrome patients and that in systemic sclerosis patients.
14423,1524,"After control for age, a positive relation was found between disease duration and total number of WMHIs (p = 0.037) and number of WMHIs 2 mm or larger (p = 0.023) in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome."
14424,1524,"In comparison with the controls, patients with primary Sjgren syndrome had decreased gray matter volume in the cortex, deep gray matter, and cerebellum."
14425,1524,Associated loss of white matter volume was observed in areas corresponding to gray matter atrophy and in the corpus callosum (p < 0.05).
14426,1524,"CONCLUSION: Patients with primary Sjgren syndrome have WMHIs and gray and white matter atrophy, probably related to cerebral vasculitis."
14427,1525,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a common disease worldwide affecting more than 2 billion people, including latent, pulmonary, and extrapulmonary TB."
14428,1525,The presentation of disseminated TB is variable and dependent on the organs affected.
14429,1525,"Therefore, making the diagnosis and providing appropriate treatment can be delayed."
14430,1525,We present a case of disseminated TB in a patient with Sjgren's syndrome on hydroxychloroquine monotherapy without traditional risk factors.
14431,1526,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune rheumatic disease with symptoms including dryness, fatigue, and pain."
14432,1526,The previous work by our group has suggested that certain proinflammatory cytokines are inversely related to patient-reported levels of fatigue.
14433,1526,"To date, these findings have not been validated."
14434,1526,This study aims to validate this observation.
14435,1526,Blood levels of seven cytokines were measured in 120 patients with pSS from the United Kingdom Primary Sjgren's Syndrome Registry and 30 age-matched healthy non-fatigued controls.
14436,1526,Patient-reported scores for fatigue were classified according to severity and compared to cytokine levels using analysis of variance.
14437,1526,The differences between cytokines in cases and controls were evaluated using Wilcoxon test.
14438,1526,A logistic regression model was used to determine the most important identifiers of fatigue.
14439,1526,"Five cytokines, interferon--induced protein-10 (IP-10), tumour necrosis factor- (TNF), interferon- (IFN), interferon- (IFN-), and lymphotoxin- (LT-) were significantly higher in patients with pSS (n=120) compared to non-fatigued controls (n=30)."
14440,1526,"Levels of two proinflammatory cytokines, TNF- (p=0.021) and LT- (p=0.043), were inversely related to patient-reported levels of fatigue."
14441,1526,"Cytokine levels, disease-specific and clinical parameters as well as pain, anxiety, and depression were used as predictors in our validation model."
14442,1526,The model correctly identifies fatigue levels with 85% accuracy.
14443,1526,"Consistent with the original study, pain, depression, and proinflammatory cytokines appear to be the most powerful predictors of fatigue in pSS."
14444,1526,TNF- and LT- have an inverse relationship with fatigue severity in pSS challenging the notion that proinflammatory cytokines directly mediate fatigue in chronic immunological conditions.
14445,1527,An 83-year-old woman with Sjgren syndrome underwent insertion of large punctal plugs in the right upper and lower puncti.
14446,1527,"Nine months later, she presented with upper canaliculitis, although the plugs were not found in the puncti."
14447,1527,"Dacryoendoscopic examination revealed punctal plug migration, granulation, and a large amount of debris in the upper canaliculus."
14448,1527,"The plug was situated parallel to the canaliculus, occluding the intracanalicular space."
14449,1527,"The lower canaliculus also showed plug migration, but little granulation and debris were present."
14450,1527,"The plug was situated perpendicular to the intracanalicular space, securing a space around the plug."
14451,1527,The migrated plugs were pushed directly toward the nasal cavity by the dacryoendoscope.
14452,1527,Curettage was performed in the upper canaliculi.
14453,1527,"Bicanalicular silicone intubation was performed, and removal was performed 3 months later."
14454,1527,The patient remained symptom-free for 6 months postoperatively.
14455,1528,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and treatment adherence of Ikervis() (Santen, SAS) (ciclosporine 0.1%) for first line therapy or following treatment with Restasis() (Allergan, Inc.) (ciclosporine 0.05%) for severe dry eye syndrome."
14456,1528,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, monocentric, uncontrolled study was conducted between January 2012and March 2015on 110eyes of 55patients with severe dry eye on first line therapy or previously treated with Restasis() who required the introduction of Ikervis()."
14457,1528,"Patients' quality of life was assessed before and after treatment was started using a standardized questionnaire (Ocular Surface Disease Index() [OSDI]), clinical efficacy was quantified at the slit lamp, by measurement of the Break Up time Test (BUT) and the Oxford classification."
14458,1528,Tolerability and adherence to treatment were measured using a simple questionnaire.
14459,1528,RESULTS: A total of 72eyes of 37patients were included.
14460,1528,Etiologies of dry eye syndrome were dominated by Sjgren syndrome (32%) and severe ocular surface conditions (48%).
14461,1528,The mean age was 57.7years (17.45) and mean follow-up was 458days (292).
14462,1528,The mean BUT increased by 2.043seconds [1.522-2.563] (P<0.0001).
14463,1528,Corneal/conjunctival involvement evaluated by the Oxford classification was also improved with a difference in level of 1.68 [1.290-2.071] (P<0.0001).
14464,1528,Ocular Surface Disease Index() (OSDI) decreased by 21.7 [16.372-27.024] (P<0.0001).
14465,1528,"Treatment tolerability was moderate, with more than 50% of patients experiencing pain on instillation."
14466,1528,"Overall satisfaction with treatment was good, with more than 60% of patients feeling better after initiation of treatment."
14467,1528,CONCLUSION: Ikervis() is an effective treatment of severe dry eye.
14468,1528,Its indications tend to evolve towards less severe dry eye.
14469,1528,"However, the tolerability profile remains poor, and an improvement in this would be desirable."
14470,1529,"To investigate the association between primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and coronary heart disease (CHD), and the influence of medications for pSS patients on risk of CHD."
14471,1529,The authors identified 4175 patients with a new diagnosis of pSS between 2002 and 2013 from the National Health Insurance Research database.
14472,1529,The control-to-case ratio was 4:1.
14473,1529,The risk and cumulative incidences of CHD were calculated.
14474,1529,"The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of CHD for pSS patients was 1.17 (1.03-1.34) after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and medications."
14475,1529,The cumulative incidence for CHD in the pSS group was significantly higher than that in the control group (log-rank p<0.0001).
14476,1529,"The risk of CHD in pSS patients was increased with age by 4% per year, and 45- to 59-year-olds were at the highest risk (HR=1.464, 1.195-1.794)."
14477,1529,"The application of corticosteroids (HR=1.45, 1.07-1.97) as well as NSAIDs (HR=1.31, 1.05-1.65) both increased the risk of CHD among pSS patients."
14478,1529,pSS is associated with an increased risk of subsequent CHD in Taiwan.
14479,1529,Primary Sjgren's syndrome might be an independent risk factor for CHD.
14480,1529,Use of corticosteroids and NSAIDs in the treatment of pSS patients increased the risk of developing CHD.
14481,1530,Anti-Ro/SS-A is one specific type of antinuclear antibodies.
14482,1530,"They are in the majority of cases associated with primary Sjgren syndrome (SS) but also in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and in healthy people."
14483,1530,"During pregnancy, they are mainly associated to congenital heart block (CHB) and neonatal lupus (NL)."
14484,1530,The aim of this study was to compare the rate of maternal and fetal complications between a series of anti-Ro/SS-A positive pregnant women prospectively followed.
14485,1530,Forty-two anti-Ro/SSA antibodies positive pregnant women that were referred to our hospital between 2011 and 2015.
14486,1530,Data about pregnancy follow-up and outcomes were prospectively recorded from electronic databases.
14487,1530,"Data included demographic characteristics of the patients and their diseases (type, treatments, profile of anti-Ro/SSA, and antiphospholipid antibodies), pregnancy complications (CHB, preeclampsia, preterm delivery), ultrasound examinations and conditions, and mode of delivery."
14488,1530,"Maternal age was 35.223.42years and most of them were either SLE (n=16, 40%) or Sjgren syndrome (n=15, 37.5%)."
14489,1530,"The rest of them were asymptomatic carriers (n=8; 20%), and there was only one case of rheumatoid arthritis (n=1; 2.5%)."
14490,1530,"The incidence of anti-Ro52 and anti-Ro60 positive was n=13, 82.4% and n=16, 100%, respectively."
14491,1530,"Anti-La/SSB antibodies were present in n=17, 48,6% of the patients."
14492,1530,"Half of the patients were taking hydroxycloroquine (n=18, 45%)."
14493,1530,"Seven pregnancies were complicated by fetal anti-Ro-related cardiac disease (17.9%) including four cases (57.1%) of second-degree heart block, two cases of third degree heart block (28.6%) and one case (14.3%) of intense and diffuse hyperechogenicity in atrioventricular valves without heart block."
14494,1530,Gestational age at diagnosis of these conditions was 23.23.5weeks.
14495,1530,"One of the 18 patients having hydroxychloroquine (5.6%) compared with the six of them in women not having this medication (6/22, 27.3%) (p=0.10)."
14496,1530,"Concerning about Doppler evaluation, the Z score of umbilical pulsatility index (PI) was significantly higher in the SLE patients (p=0.02)."
14497,1530,There were no cases of preeclampsia.
14498,1530,Labor was induced in 21 cases (52.5%) and cesarean section rate was 45%.
14499,1530,"Gestational age at birth was 39 (37-40)weeks, and the general prematurity rate was 20% (n=8)."
14500,1530,Birthweight was 2985g (2425-3185g) and 2850 (12.25-52.50) centiles for gestational age.
14501,1530,"The rate of small for gestational age (SGA) infants was 31.3% for SLE patients (5/16), 13.3% for Sjgren syndrome (2/15), and 12.5% for asymptomatic women (1/8)."
14502,1530,"The rate of neonatal acidosis (pH<7.20) was 20% (8/34) and it was higher in the SLE cases (6/15, 40%) when delivered after 38weeks."
14503,1530,The main pregnancy complication associated to anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies is CHB.
14504,1530,The prevalence of CHB in patients taking hydroxychloriquine is lower without distinguishing between high or low risk patients.
14505,1530,Preterm delivery occurs in anti-Ro/SS-A patients at the same rate as in the general population if no complications such as CHB or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) occur.
14506,1530,The SGA rate also is higher probably because of SLE not because anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies.
14507,1530,"Finally, the finding of high umbilical artery PI will allow to predict fetus at risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes."
14508,1530,HIGHLIGHTS: Anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B are clinically very relevant during pregnancy mainly because of their association to congenital heart block and neonatal lupus.
14509,1530,"In our cohort, the prevalence of congenital heart block detected in patients taking hydroxycloroquine is much lower than in patients not taking it without distinguishing between high and low risk patients."
14510,1530,High umbilical artery pulsatility index in Doppler scans studies has been detected in our anti-Ro/SSA population (basely in SLE patients) demonstrated this measurement as a predictor of SGA and adverse pregnancy outcomes in general population such as cesarean section for fetal distress.
14511,1530,The small for gestational age rate is higher probably because of SLE not because anti-Ro/SS-A Preterm delivery happens in anti-Ro/SS-A patients at the same rate as in the general population if no complications such as congenital heart block or intrauterine growth restriction occur.
14512,1531,"INTRODUCTION: The lacrimal gland (LG) of the CD25-/- model of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) has high interleukin (IL)-17, IL-13 and interferon-gamma (IFN-) cytokines."
14513,1531,The specific contribution of these cytokines to the onset and severity of dacryoadenitis in the CD25-/- mice has not been evaluated.
14514,1531,"METHODS: CD25-/-IL-17A-/-, CD25-/-IL-17-/-IFN--/- and CD25-/-IFN--/- were used at 4, 8, 12, 16 weeks (W)."
14515,1531,Total lymphocytic infiltration was evaluated by histology and characterized by flow cytometry.
14516,1531,Epidermal growth factor (EGF) concentration was measured in tears.
14517,1531,Immunofluorescent staining evaluated expression of IFN- receptor (IFN-R) and apoptosis.
14518,1531,Real-time PCR evaluated inflammatory and T cell-related cytokines expression in LG.
14519,1531,"Caspase-3, -8, -9 activities was assayed in LG lysates."
14520,1531,T helper cytokines were measured in serum by Luminex assay.
14521,1531,"RESULTS: The greatest total LG infiltration at 8 W was seen in CD25-/-IL-17A-/- (95%), followed by CD25-/- (71%) and IL-17-/- (12%)."
14522,1531,Tear EGF concentration was in normal range in CD25-/- at 4 W and in very low levels in both CD25-/- and CD25-/-IL-17A-/-.
14523,1531,"CD25-/- had high levels of inflammatory cytokines transcripts in LG compared to IL-17-/- mice; however, CD25-/-IL-17A-/- had even higher IL-1, IFN-R, caspase-3, -8, -9 mRNA levels, greater immunoreactivity to IFN-R in LG acini, greater number of apoptotic+ cells and greater caspases activities in the LG at 8 W. CD25-/-IL-17A-/- had lower IL-13 concentration and lower IL-13/IFN- ratio compared to CD25-/- in serum."
14524,1531,CD25-/-IFN--/- had lower number of apoptotic+ cells and decreased caspase-3 expression in LG.
14525,1531,"CD25-/-IL-17-/-IFN--/- had lower total lymphocytic cell infiltration at 8 W (48%), CD4+T cell infiltration and expression of IFN-R and apoptotic+ cells in the LG and increased tear EGF concentration in tears."
14526,1531,CONCLUSIONS: IFN- is critical for LG destruction and secretory dysfunction in the CD25-/- model of SS.
14527,1531,Altered balance between IFN- and IL-13 in the CD25-/-IL-17A-/- mice accelerates LG destruction by increasing glandular apoptosis and facilitating apoptosis through increased expression of IFN-R by glandular epithelium and activation of caspases.
14528,1531,Targeting both IFN- and IL-17 may be beneficial for treating the LG inflammation in SS.
14529,1532,"BACKGROUND: Salivary gland dysfunction is one of the main clinical features of Sjgren's syndrome (SS), manifested by xerostomia with subsequent complications and well-established effects on the person's quality of life."
14530,1532,"OBJECTIVES: To determine firstly whether selected tests of salivary gland function and structure, unstimulated whole salivary flow rate (UWSFR), parotid flow rate (PFR), clinical oral dryness score (CODS) and ultrasound score (USS), can discriminate SS from non-SS sicca patients and secondly whether these tests can differentiate between patients in different subgroups of SS."
14531,1532,"METHOD: Unstimulated whole salivary flow rate, PFR, CODS and USS were determined in 244 patients comprised of SS patients (n=118), SS patients at higher risk of lymphoma (n=30) or with lymphoma (n=26), and non-SS sicca disease controls (n=70)."
14532,1532,"RESULTS: All assessments showed a significant difference between the overall SS group and the disease control group, attributed mainly to the lymphoma subgroups of SS (p<0.0001 for all parameters)."
14533,1532,"There was a significant correlation (Spearman r=0.7, p value <0.0001) and 87.3% agreement between USS and the histology focus scores of 119 patients."
14534,1532,"CONCLUSION: The results suggest that salivary gland tests including USS can aid in differentiating between SS and non-SS dry mouth, especially the subgroups of SS with lymphoma or at higher risk of developing lymphoma."
14535,1533,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate if indicators of a heavier involvement of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), i.e."
14536,1533,"persistent salivary gland (SG) swelling and cryoglobulinaemia, might better evaluate the lymphoma risk compared to the ESSDAI."
14537,1533,"Therefore, the current concept of disease activity of pSS should be re-evaluated, based solely on ESSDAI."
14538,1533,"METHODS: A cohort of 255 pSS patients, including 30 pSS with B-cell lymphoma, was investigated."
14539,1533,"Three subgroups were distinguished, i.e."
14540,1533,"pSS developing lymphoma in the follow-up (n=12), pSS with lymphoma at cohort inclusion (n=18), and control pSS not developing lymphoma in the follow-up (n=225)."
14541,1533,"SG swelling, cryoglobulinaemia and ESSDAI were evaluated at baseline, in the follow-up to one year before lymphoma diagnosis, and at lymphoma diagnosis."
14542,1533,"RESULTS: SG swelling and/or cryoglobulinaemia at baseline were significantly higher (p=0.0003) in pSS patients evolving into lymphoma if compared to pSS controls, while ESSDAI showed no significant difference."
14543,1533,Both SG swelling and cryoglobulinaemia persisted and sometimes developed ex novo in the follow-up.
14544,1533,"SG swelling and cryoglobulinaemia were present in 24/30 (80%) cases the time of lymphoma diagnosis, and lymphoma itself was usually of MALT/marginal zone histotype (90%), leading to peculiar manifestation of lymphoma in pSS."
14545,1533,CONCLUSIONS: The autoimmune and lymphoproliferative involvement of MALT is the biological substrate of pSS.
14546,1533,"If this involvement is heavier, as reflected by SG swelling and cryoglobulinaemia, disease activity may be considered higher, and the risk of lymphoma is increased."
14547,1533,"The current concept and evaluation of activity of pSS, based solely on the ESSDAI, needs revision."
14548,1534,Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjgren's syndrome are autoimmune disorders which are characterized by a disturbed B cell homeostasis which leads ultimately to dysfunction of various organs.
14549,1534,"One of the B cell subsets that appear in abnormal numbers is the population of transitional B cells, which is increased in the blood of patients with SLE and Sjgren's syndrome."
14550,1534,Transitional B cells are newly formed B cells.
14551,1534,"In mice, transitional B cells undergo selection checks for unwanted specificity in the bone marrow and the spleen in order to eliminate autoreactive B cells from the circulating naive B cell population."
14552,1534,"In humans, the exact anatomical compartments and mechanisms of the specificity check-points for transitional B cells remain unclear, but appear to be defective in SLE and Sjgren's syndrome."
14553,1534,This review aims to highlight the current understanding of transitional B cells and their defects in the two disorders before and after B cell-targeted therapies.
14554,1535,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune epithelitis which usually presents with mouth and eye dryness.
14555,1535,"Although the place of systemic drugs in keratoconjunctivitis sicca treatment has been discussed, the efficacy of some topical drugs has also been demonstrated; however, there are contradictory results related to topical cyclosporine A."
14556,1535,We aimed to investigate the efficacy of 0.05 % topical cyclosporine A in patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca due to primary and secondary SS.
14557,1535,This prospective study included 26 patients with a diagnosis of primary and secondary SS who visited our rheumatology outpatient clinic.
14558,1535,Keratoconjunctivitis sicca was diagnosed in all patients after they were examined at the outpatient clinic.
14559,1535,Patients were given topical 0.05 % cyclosporine A emulsions for both eyes.
14560,1535,We used another 20 patients with SS who were treated with saline solution as a control group.
14561,1535,"Subjective symptoms reported after 1-week and 1-month follow-up were complaints of burning and pricking sensation, light sensitivity and pain."
14562,1535,"Objective signs included redness, Schirmer test and tear break-up time."
14563,1535,A total of 26 patients (19 female) were enrolled in the study with a mean age of 47.5 years and mean disease duration of 5.2 years.
14564,1535,"In the first physical examination of patients, 23 patients had burning and pricking sensation, 24 had pain, 23 had light sensitivity, and 24 had red eyes."
14565,1535,"All subjective symptoms (burning and pricking sensation, light sensitivity and pain) were statistically significantly improved after 1-week and 1-month follow-up examinations (p = 0.0001)."
14566,1535,"All objective signs (Schirmer test, tear break-up time, and redness) were statistically significantly improved after 1-week and 1-month follow-up examinations (p = 0.0001)."
14567,1535,"Compared with the control group, there was significant improvement in all parameters."
14568,1535,It is concluded that topical 0.05 % cyclosporine A is an effective treatment option for keratoconjunctivitis sicca due to SS after a 1-month follow-up period.
14569,1536,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the multiobserver reliability of salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) for scoring greyscale (GS) parenchymal inhomogeneity and parenchymal color Doppler (CD) signal in patients with established primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS).
14570,1536,METHODS: The study comprised 2 multiobserver reliability assessments in patients with pSS in 2 European centers.
14571,1536,"The first reliability exercise was performed on 24 patients with pSS and 8 controls who were independently evaluated with GS and CD US by 5 observers at the Institute of Rheumatology, Belgrade, Serbia."
14572,1536,The second reliability exercise was carried out on 10 patients with pSS who were independently assessed with GS and CD US by 8 observers at the Hospital G.U.
14573,1536,"Gregorio Maran, Madrid, Spain."
14574,1536,SGUS parenchymal inhomogeneity and parenchymal CD signal were semiquantitatively scored using a 4-grade scoring system.
14575,1536,The multiobserver agreement was calculated by the overall agreement and Light's  statistics.
14576,1536,RESULTS: A total of 640 SGUS examinations were performed in the first reliability exercise and a total of 320 examinations in the second reliability exercise.
14577,1536,Multiobserver reliability was good ( = 0.71-0.79) to excellent ( = 0.81-0.82) for GS parenchymal inhomogeneity in both exercises.
14578,1536,There was a moderate ( = 0.53-0.58) to good ( = 0.70) multiobserver reliability for parenchymal CD signal in the first exercise.
14579,1536,"However, there was no agreement or only a fair agreement ( = 0.03-0.29) for parenchymal CD signal in the second exercise."
14580,1536,CONCLUSION: US may be a reliable technique in the multiobserver scoring of GS parenchymal inhomogeneity of major SG in patients with established pSS.
14581,1536,CD scoring of SG needs further standardization to be used in multicenter studies.
14582,1537,"The endothelial cell adhesion molecule, CD146, is expressed on  2% of normal circulating T cells, correlating with T cell activation, endothelial interactions and T helper type 17 (Th17) effector functions."
14583,1537,"In this study, we have characterized CD146 expression in circulating T cells from healthy controls and patients with stable, well-controlled autoimmune connective tissue diseases (CTDs)."
14584,1537,"In vitro, anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation induced CD146 expression in both CD4 and CD8 T cells."
14585,1537,"In healthy controls and CTD patients, CD146 was associated with expression of recent and chronic activation markers (CD25(+), OX-40(+), CD69(+), CD27(-)) and was confined to CD45RO(+)/RA(-)/CD28(+) populations within the CD4 subset."
14586,1537,"Except for CD69, these markers were not associated with CD146 in the CD8 subset."
14587,1537,"Surprisingly, most CTD patients exhibited no T cell hyperactivation ex vivo."
14588,1537,"In five of five patients with secondary Sjgren's syndrome circulating T cells appeared activated despite therapy, and CD146 up-regulation, associated with activation markers, was observed both on CD4 and CD8 T cells."
14589,1537,There was no association between CD146 and putative pro-atherogenic T cell subsets.
14590,1537,"In conclusion, the relationship of CD146 expression to T cell activation differs between T cell subsets in healthy subjects and correlates with systemic hyperactivity, where present, in patients with CTDs, as exemplified by the patients with secondary Sjgren's syndrome in this study."
14591,1538,PURPOSE: To investigate the changes in functional visual acuity (VA) and higher order aberrations in dry eye patients.
14592,1538,"METHODS: In this prospective comparative case series, 22 right eyes were classified into those with or without superficial punctate keratopathy (SPK) in the central cornea of 22 patients with Sjgren syndrome; 10 right eyes of 10 normal subjects served as the control."
14593,1538,Serial measurements of VAs using a functional VA measurement system and higher order aberrations using a wavefront sensor were performed under blink-free conditions without topical anesthesia over a 10-second period.
14594,1538,The parameters for each measurement were compared among the SPK-positive and -negative and normal groups.
14595,1538,The correlation between those parameters was also analyzed.
14596,1538,"RESULTS: Dry eye with SPK showed significant deterioration of visual function and optical quality compared with dry eye without SPK and in normal eyes, as detected by both the visual maintenance ratio (VMR; P < 0.05) and the variation of VA (P < 0.05) and by comalike and total higher order aberrations (P < 0.05)."
14597,1538,"Moreover, the severity of epithelial damage at the central cornea correlated significantly with VMR (P < 0.01) and variation of VA (P < 0.01) as well as comalike (P < 0.05) and total higher order aberrations (P < 0.05)."
14598,1538,"The dry eye group without SPK showed minor visual deterioration compared with normal eyes, as detected only by VMR (P < 0.05)."
14599,1538,CONCLUSIONS: Optical disturbances at the central optical zone of the cornea in dry eye disease may affect visual performance.
14600,1538,Functional VA measurement may be an applicable method of evaluating visual performance in dry eyes that is as efficient as wavefront aberration measurements.
14601,1539,OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggested a potential of rituximab (RTX) in treating autoimmune thrombocytopenia (AITP) secondary to autoimmune diseases.
14602,1539,"In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of RTX therapy in patients with refractory AITP secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjgren syndrome (SS)."
14603,1539,"METHODS: Twenty-one SLE and/or SS patients with treatment-resistant AITP were treated once or repeatedly with RTX at the Rheumatology Clinic Renji Hospital, during the period March 2012 to June 2014."
14604,1539,Clinical and laboratory variables recorded at every follow-up visit were analyzed.
14605,1539,"RESULTS: The median age of all patients was 37.05  3.15 years (range, 13-67 years; 20 female and 1 male)."
14606,1539,The median AITP duration before RTX treatment was 5.46 years.
14607,1539,"Previous treatments of 21 patients included immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids (n = 19), cyclosporine (n = 9), mycophenolate mofetil (n = 2), methotrexate (n = 3), cyclophosphamide (n = 2), vincristine (n = 3), and hydroxychloroquine (n = 15), and 7 patients received concomitantly intravenous immunoglobulin therapy."
14608,1539,Two patients had undergone splenectomy without improvement.
14609,1539,Seventeen patients (80.95%) were treated repeatedly with RTX during the follow-up period.
14610,1539,"The overall response rate to RTX treatment (including complete response, 52.38%; partial response, 28.57%) was 80.95%."
14611,1539,"A significant increase (P < 0.05) of platelet counts was seen after 1 month (median, 32.24  10/mL vs 66.53  10/mL)."
14612,1539,"Relapses occurred mostly during the first 9 months, and maintaining duration of response was 10.27 months (range, 2-17 months) on average after the first RTX infusion."
14613,1539,"Antiplatelet antibodies, especially IgG isotype, decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after RTX treatment."
14614,1539,"No adverse effects were observed among 15 patients (71.4%); however, 2 cases died of severe pneumonia, and another developed lymphoma."
14615,1539,CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab is an additional potent therapeutic treatment option for SLE and SS patients with AITP refractory to conventional immunosuppressive treatments.
14616,1539,"For most patients, RTX was safe and well tolerated."
14617,1540,The Sjgren syndrome has been diagnosed in patients with HTLV-1 associated myelopathy and dry mouth and dry eyes are documented in HTLV-1 carriers.
14618,1540,However the diagnosis of Sjgren syndrome in these subjects has been contested.
14619,1540,"In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the role of immunological factors and proviral load, in sicca syndrome associated with HTLV-1 in patients without myelopathy."
14620,1540,"Subjects were recruited in the HTLV-1 Clinic, from 2009 to 2011."
14621,1540,"The proviral load and cytokine levels (IFN-, TNF-, IL-5, and IL-10) were obtained from a database containing the values presented by the subjects at admission in the clinic."
14622,1540,"Of the 272 participants, 59 (21.7%) had sicca syndrome and in all of them anti-Sjgren syndrome related antigen A (SSA) and antigen B (SSB) were negatives."
14623,1540,The production of TNF- and IFN- was higher in the group with sicca syndrome (P < 0.05) than in HTLV-1 infected subjects without sicca syndrome.
14624,1540,Our data indicates that patients with sicca syndrome associated with HTLV-1 do not have Sjgren syndrome.
14625,1540,However the increased production of TNF- and IFN- in this group of patients may contribute to the pathogenesis of sicca syndrome associated with HTLV-1.
14626,1541,Sjgren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of salivary glands resulting in impaired secretory function.
14627,1541,"Our present studies indicate that chronic exposure of salivary epithelium to TNF- and/or IFN- alters tight junction integrity, leading to secretory dysfunction."
14628,1541,Resolvins of the D-series (RvDs) are endogenous lipid mediators derived from DHA that regulate excessive inflammatory responses leading to resolution and tissue homeostasis.
14629,1541,"In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that activation of the RvD1 receptor ALX/FPR2 in salivary epithelium prevents and/or resolves the TNF--mediated disruption of acinar organization and enhances monolayer formation."
14630,1541,"Our results indicate that 1) the RvD1 receptor ALX/FPR2 is present in fresh, isolated cells from mouse salivary glands and in cell lines of salivary origin; and 2) the agonist RvD1 (100 ng/ml) abolished tight junction and cytoskeletal disruption caused by TNF- and enhanced cell migration and polarity in salivary epithelium."
14631,1541,These effects were blocked by the ALX/FPR2 antagonist butyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe.
14632,1541,"The ALX/FPR2 receptor signals via modulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways since, in our study, blocking PI3K activation with LY294002, a potent and selective PI3K inhibitor, prevented RvD1-induced cell migration."
14633,1541,"Furthermore, Akt gene silencing with the corresponding siRNA almost completely blocked the ability of Par-C10 cells to migrate."
14634,1541,"Our findings suggest that RvD1 receptor activation promotes resolution of inflammation and tissue repair in salivary epithelium, which may have relevance in the restoration of salivary gland dysfunction associated with Sjgren's syndrome."
14635,1542,OBJECTIVE: Sjgrens syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease with a variety of presenting symptoms that may delay its diagnosis.
14636,1542,We previously discovered a number of candidate salivary biomarkers for primary SS using both mass spectrometry and expression microarray analysis.
14637,1542,"In the current study, we aimed to verify these candidate biomarkers in independent patient populations and to evaluate their predictive values for primary SS detection."
14638,1542,"METHODS: In total, 34 patients with primary SS, 34 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and 34 healthy individuals were enrolled for the validation studies."
14639,1542,"Salivary protein biomarkers were measured using either Western blotting or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the messenger RNA (mRNA) biomarkers were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction."
14640,1542,"Statistical analysis was performed using R software, version 2.9."
14641,1542,"RESULTS: Three protein biomarkers (cathepsin D [CPD], -enolase, and -microglobulin [m]) and 3 mRNA biomarkers (myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen [MNDA], guanylate binding protein 2 [GBP-2], and low-affinity IIIb receptor for the Fc fragment of IgG) were significantly elevated in patients with primary SS compared with both SLE patients and healthy controls."
14642,1542,"The combination of 3 protein biomarkers, CPD, -enolase, and m, yielded a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) value of 0.99 in distinguishing primary SS from healthy controls."
14643,1542,"The combination of protein biomarkers m and 2 mRNA biomarkers, MNDA and GBP-2, reached an ROC of 0.95 in discriminating primary SS from SLE."
14644,1542,CONCLUSION: We have successfully verified a panel of protein and mRNA biomarkers that can discriminate primary SS from both SLE and healthy controls.
14645,1542,"If further validated in patients with primary SS and those with sicca symptoms but no autoimmune disease, these biomarkers may lead to a simple yet highly discriminatory clinical tool for diagnosis of primary SS."
14646,1543,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is often argued that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have more headaches than healthy subjects, but this association remains controversial."
14647,1543,"Thus the magnitude and severity of headaches in SLE were evaluated in comparison with another autoimmune disease, namely primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
14648,1543,"METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with SLE, 71 pSS patients and 108 healthy subjects were included."
14649,1543,"The International Classification of Headache Disorders, Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6), and the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire were used to classify and assess headache-related disability."
14650,1543,"RESULTS: Primary headaches were more prevalent in SLE patients than in healthy subjects (82% vs. 69%, P=0.01)."
14651,1543,"Amongst the headache sufferers, SLE patients (N=55) and pSS patients (N=51) had higher HIT-6 scores (median 51, range 36-67, and median 54, range 36-72, respectively) than healthy subjects (N=69) (median 46, range 36-72; P=0.02 and P=0.0009, respectively)."
14652,1543,"Also, MIDAS scores were higher in SLE (median 0, range 0-110) and pSS patients (median 1, range 0-40) than in healthy subjects (median 0, range 0-10; P=0.04 and P=0.003, respectively)."
14653,1543,CONCLUSION: Patients with SLE and pSS have a higher burden from headaches and more severe headaches than headache sufferers without these diseases.
14654,1543,"However, evidence of a specific bothersome SLE headache was not possible to identify as the headaches had the same characteristics and similar impact and severity in pSS patients."
14655,1543,Depressive mood significantly influenced headache severity.
14656,1544,Inflammatory periodontal disease (PD) is a common disease worldwide that has a primarily bacterial aetiology and is characterized by dysregulation of the host inflammatory response.
14657,1544,"The degree of inflammation varies among individuals with PD independently of the degree of bacterial infection, suggesting that alteration of the immune function may substantially contribute to its extent."
14658,1544,"Factors such as smoking, education, and body mass index (BMI) are discussed as potential risk factors for PD."
14659,1544,"Most PD patients respond to bacterial invaders by mobilizing their defensive cells and releasing cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-6, which ultimately causes tissue destruction by stimulating the production of collagenolytic enzymes, such matrix metalloproteinases."
14660,1544,"Recently, there has been growing evidence suggesting an association between PD and the increased risk of systemic diseases, such ateriosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, stroke, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)."
14661,1544,PD and rheumatologic diseases such as RA share many pathological aspects and immunological findings.
14662,1545,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of different therapeutic regimens in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)complicating Sjgren syndrome (SS).
14663,1545,"METHODS: A total of 79 patients diagnosed as PBC complicating SS were enrolled and randomly divided into three groups: Group U (29 patients) received ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) alone, Group UP (37 patients) received UDCA and prednisolone, Group UA (13 patients) received UDCA and azathioprine."
14664,1545,"The clinical and laboratory data were collected at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment."
14665,1545,RESULTS: Fatigue and pruritus were improved in each group with no difference among them (P > 0.05).
14666,1545,"The levels of ALT, AST, alkaline phophatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), TBil, DBil, IgG, and IgM in the three groups were all decreased after treatment (P < 0.05), while there were no statistical differences among the three groups (P > 0.05)."
14667,1545,CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy of UDCA with prednisolone or azathioprine was not better than UDCA alone.
14668,1545,The therapeutic policy of PBC complicating SS involved in the liver should settle PBC mainly.
14669,1546,"Cevimeline is a muscarinic agonist that promotes saliva secretion and is used to treat Sjgren's syndrome (SS), an autoimmune disorder in which the exocrine glands that produce saliva are destroyed."
14670,1546,Cevimeline is thought to affect the composition of saliva in part by regulating the localization of aquaporins (AQPs).
14671,1546,"In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic Cevimeline administration in the salivary glands of SS mice on the immunohistochemical localization of aquaporin (AQP)-1, 3, 4, 5 and 8."
14672,1546,"We used Cevimeline-untreated SS mice, treated SS mice, discontinued SS mice and untreated normal mice."
14673,1546,AQP-5 was found in the apical and lateral membranes of acinar cells in the parotid and submandibular glands of cevimeline-treated SS mice and untreated normal mice.
14674,1546,Saliva secretion and AQP-5 localization were sustained in SS mice who were chronically administered Cevimeline and at four weeks after discontinuation.
14675,1546,"Unlike AQP-5, the localization of AQP-1, 3, 4 and 8 were not affected by Cevimeline administration."
14676,1546,"Our findings demonstrated that administration of Cevimeline maintains the proper localization of AQP-5 in the acinar cells of the salivary gland, which may promote salivation in chronically treated SS mice."
14677,1546,"Clinically, this suggests that chronic Cevimeline administration may be useful therapeutically for SS patients suffering from a decrease in saliva secretion by improving the disordered AQP-5 localization."
14678,1547,"RATIONALE: Sjgren syndrome (SS) is frequently associated with ulcerative keratitis, which is difficult to treat due to lacrimal tear deficiency and inflammation of the ocular surface."
14679,1547,"PATIENT CONCERNS: We report the successful additive effect of a matrix regenerating agent (RGTA, Cacicol) in SS patients with severe superficial ulcerative keratitis resistant to conventional therapy."
14680,1547,"DIAGNOSES: Retrospective, noncomparative case series of patients with primary or secondary SS associated with chronic diffuse keratitis."
14681,1547,"INTERVENTIONS: All patients (3 women, aged 46, 59, and 84 years) had several years of dry-eye disease history and recurrent keratitis despite having used maximal dose topical therapies including artificial tear substitutes, topical vitamin A, and cyclosporine 0.05% emulsion."
14682,1547,"All patients suffered from dry, diffuse, and chronic superficial keratitis of at least 75% of the corneal surface, with no sign of corneal neovascularization or opacity."
14683,1547,"OUTCOMES: RGTA treatment led to a rapid and marked decrease of ocular pain, burning, irritation, foreign body sensation, and improvement of visual acuity."
14684,1547,Total diffuse keratitis healing occurred after several months of treatment.
14685,1547,Discontinuation of RGTA administration led to the recurrence of severe keratitis; re-introduction of RGTA was successful.
14686,1547,No local or systemic adverse effects related to treatment were reported.
14687,1547,LESSONS: RGTA treatment was effective and safe in this small series of 3 patients suffering from SS associated with recurrent or chronic superficial ulcerative keratitis resistant to conventional therapy.
14688,1548,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that lacks sensitive and specific diagnostic methods.
14689,1548,The aim of this study was to identify potential biomarkers specific for pSS and to establish a diagnostic model.
14690,1548,"Serum samples from patients with pSS, disease controls (DC, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA)), and healthy controls (HC)) were randomly divided into a training set (35 pSS, 50 DC, and 26 HC) and a testing set (25 pSS, 50 DC, and 25 HC)."
14691,1548,Weak cationic exchange (WCX) magnetic beads were used to differentially capture serum proteins prior to proteomic analysis.
14692,1548,Proteomic mass spectra were generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS).
14693,1548,"One hundred differential M/Z peaks associated with pSS were identified, and the m/z peaks at 8,133.85, 11,972.8, 2,220.81, and 4,837.66 were used to establish a diagnostic model for pSS."
14694,1548,"This diagnostic model was able to distinguish pSS from non-pSS controls with a sensitivity of 77.1 % and a specificity of 85.5 %, and its efficacy was confirmed in our blinded testing set with good sensitivity and specificity of 95.5 and 88 %, respectively."
14695,1548,The results indicated that the proteomic fingerprinting model was effective in the diagnosis of pSS.
14696,1549,OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of the interleukin (IL)-33-ST2 axis in the pathophysiology of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
14697,1549,METHODS: Serum levels of IL-33 and sST2 were determined by ELISA.
14698,1549,The expression of IL-33 and ST2 was investigated in salivary glands (SG) by immunohistochemistry.
14699,1549,"PBMC were isolated and stimulated with IL-33, IL-12 and IL-23 and the cytokine profile response was examined by flow cytometry."
14700,1549,Intracellular cytokine detection of IFN and IL-17 was performed by flow cytometry.
14701,1549,RESULTS: Serum IL-33 and sST2 levels were increased in pSS patients compared with controls and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
14702,1549,Expression of IL-33 was upregulated in SG with Chisholm scores of 2 and 3 of pSS patients but comparable with controls for SG with Chisholm score of 4.
14703,1549,ST2 expression in SG was downregulated in pSS patients.
14704,1549,IL-33 at different concentrations did not increase the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines but acted synergistically with IL-12 and IL-23 to promote IFN production.
14705,1549,NK and NKT cells were identified as main producers of IFN in vitro and were found in SG of pSS patients.
14706,1549,"CONCLUSIONS: IL-33 is released in pSS, and acts with IL-12 and IL-23 to favour the secretion of IFN by NK and NKT cells."
14707,1550,"OBJECTIVES: To perform an observational retrospective cross-sectional case-control study to evaluate prevalence, clinical patterns and outcomes of neurological involvement in a cohort of Primary Sjgren Syndrome (pSS) patients followed up in a single center."
14708,1550,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: From a total of 93 pSS patients, diagnosed according to the 2002 criteria proposed by the American-European Consensus Group, we reviewed the clinical data of those with neurological complaints that were referred to observation by Neuroimmunology doctors."
14709,1550,"Demographic, clinical, seroimmunological data were compared between patients with and without neurological involvement."
14710,1550,RESULTS: Neurological involvement was detected in 26 (28%) of the 93 patients.
14711,1550,Neurological symptoms preceded the diagnosis of pSS in 12 (46%) patients.
14712,1550,They were all females.
14713,1550,"The mean age at disease onset and neurological onset were 41,2 and 47,9 years, respectively."
14714,1550,"Twelve patients (46%) had peripheral system involvement (PNS), 13 (50%) patients had central nervous involvement (CNS) disorders and one (4%) patient had both PNS and CNS involvement."
14715,1550,"In patients with PNS, pure sensory neuropathy (small fiber neuropathy confirmed by quantitative sensory testing and sural neuropathy) occurred most frequently (n =5), followed by cranial nerve involvement affecting trigeminal, facial, or trochlear nerves (n = 4)."
14716,1550,"Multiple mononeuropathy (n = 1), sensorimotor polyneuropathy (n=1), autonomic neuropathy (n=1) and myasthenia gravis (n = 1), were also observed."
14717,1550,"In patients with CNS disorders, headache (n=3) occurred most frequently, in two patients with MRI abnormalities compatible with inflammatory disease."
14718,1550,"Spinal cord involvement (n=2), seizures (n = 2), motor and sensory deficit (n=2), movement disorders (n=2), neuromyelitis optica (n=2), aseptic meningitis (n=1) were others manifestations observed."
14719,1550,Cognitive dysfunction was observed in 3 of these patients.
14720,1550,"The frequency of constitutional symptoms (such as fever and fatigue) and lung involvement was significantly higher (p< 0,05) and the articular symptoms were significantly less frequent (p< 0,05) in pSS with neurological involvement."
14721,1550,The neurologic outcome was good in 77% of the patients.
14722,1550,CONCLUSION: The current study underlines the diversity of neurologic complications of pSS.
14723,1550,"The frequency of neurologic manifestations as first manifestation of pSS, especially in the event of CNS involvement, could explain why SS is frequently under diagnosed or late diagnosed."
14724,1550,"Screening for SS should be systematically performed in cases of acute or chronic myelopathy, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, or cranial nerve involvement."
14725,1551,PURPOSE: To determine the intra-observer and inter-observer reliability of a novel ocular staining score among trained ophthalmologists.
14726,1551,"DESIGN: Reliability analysis within a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study."
14727,1551,"METHODS: Those enrolled in the National Institutes of Health-funded Sjgren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) who presented for follow-up at the University of California San Francisco, Aravind Eye Hospital, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Pennsylvania were included."
14728,1551,Study participants were graded using the ocular staining score by at least 2 masked SICCA-trained ophthalmologists.
14729,1551,The primary outcome for this study was the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the total ocular staining score.
14730,1551,ICCs were also calculated for tear break-up time (TBUT) and conjunctival and corneal staining.
14731,1551,RESULTS: Total ocular staining score had an ICC of 0.91 for the right eye (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.96) and 0.90 for the left eye (95% CI 0.83-0.97).
14732,1551,"Corneal staining (right eye 0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.93, left eye 0.90, 95% CI 0.81-0.95) and conjunctival staining (right eye 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.93, left eye 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.93) demonstrated excellent agreement."
14733,1551,"The ICC for TBUT was slightly lower (right eye 0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.89; left eye 0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.90)."
14734,1551,CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have shown that the ocular staining score is correlated with other diagnostic components of Sjgren syndrome.
14735,1551,"In this study, we demonstrate high reliability in grading among trained ophthalmologists, completing the validation of this test."
14736,1552,"Lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) may involve intrathoracic organs in patients with autoimmune disease, but little is known about the radiologic manifestations of autoimmune disease-associated LPDs (ALPDs) of the lungs."
14737,1552,The purpose of our work was to identify the radiologic characteristics of pulmonary involvement in ALPDs.
14738,1552,A comprehensive search for PubMed database was conducted with the combination of MeSH words.
14739,1552,All articles which had original images or description on radiologic findings were included in this analysis.
14740,1552,"Also, CT images of eight patients with biopsy-proven lymphoproliferative disorder observed from our institution were added."
14741,1552,"Overall, 44 cases of ALPD were identified, and consisted of 24 cases of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (BALToma), eight cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), six cases of lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP), two cases of nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, two cases of unclassified lymphoproliferative disorder, and one case each of lymphomatoid granulomatosis and hyperblastic BALT."
14742,1552,"Multiple nodules (n = 14, 32 %) and single mass (n = 8, 18 %) were the predominant radiologic manifestations."
14743,1552,"The imaging findings conformed to previously described findings of BALToma, NHL, or LIP."
14744,1552,"Data suggest that BALToma, NHL, and LIP are the predominant ALPDs of the lung, and ALPD generally shared common radiologic features with sporadic LPDs."
14745,1552,"Familiarity with ALPDs and their imaging findings may enable radiologists or clinicians to include the disease as a potential differential diagnosis and thus, to prompt early biopsy followed by appropriate treatment."
14746,1553,"OBJECTIVE: The risk for congenital heart block (CHB) associated with maternal Ro/SSA autoantibodies is low, but the possibility of treating early stages of disease has seen the introduction of Doppler echocardiographic surveillance programs with serial examinations during the CHB susceptibility weeks of pregnancy."
14747,1553,The aim of the present study was to understand how Ro/SSA autoantibody-positive women having undergone Doppler echocardiographic surveillance programs and giving birth to children without CHB experienced their pregnancy and frequent ultrasound examinations.
14748,1553,METHODS: A validated questionnaire based on data from an interview-study was distributed to Ro/SSA-positive women supervised with Doppler examinations during their pregnancy (n=100).
14749,1553,RESULTS: The response rate was 79%.
14750,1553,"The majority of the women (61%) reported that the increased number of ultrasound examinations influenced their pregnancy, but in a positive way, with qualified information and additional support from health care personnel in conjunction with the examinations."
14751,1553,"Further, the visits to the clinic provided opportunities to see the ultrasound picture of the expected infant."
14752,1553,"However, one-third of the women also reported stress in relation to the examinations."
14753,1553,CONCLUSIONS: Fetal echocardiographic surveillance holds many and predominantly positive effects for Ro/SSA-positive women during pregnancy in addition to the medical advantages.
14754,1554,We herein report a Japanese patient with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) who developed the clinical manifestations of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and Sjgren's syndrome.
14755,1554,The patient was a 36-year-old woman presenting with a periodic short-duration (2-3 days) fever and pleural pain.
14756,1554,An Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene analysis detected a complex allele mutation (P369S/R408Q) in exon 3 of the MEFV gene.
14757,1554,Serological and clinical data showed the coexistence of MCTD and Sjgren's syndrome.
14758,1554,"Treatment with colchicine (1.0 mg/day) successfully eliminated febrile attack and pleuritis, leading to the diagnosis of FMF."
14759,1554,"Four months after the initiation of colchicine treatment, she presented with MCTD-related pulmonary artery hypertension."
14760,1554,This is the first report of FMF coexisting with MCTD.
14761,1555,OBJECTIVE: The role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in the pathophysiology of rheumatic diseases is emerging.
14762,1555,"Evidence from animal studies implicate type I IFN, produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, to be involved in regulating the survival of group 2 and group 3 ILCs (ILC2s and ILC3s) via the upregulation of Fas (CD95) expression."
14763,1555,"For the first time, we explored the frequency and phenotype of circulating ILCs in SLE and primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) in relationship to the IFN signature."
14764,1555,"METHODS: Frequencies and phenotypes of ILC subsets and plasmacytoid dendritic cells were assessed by flow cytometry in peripheral blood of patients with SLE (n = 20), pSS (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 17)."
14765,1555,Patients were stratified by the presence or absence of an IFN signature as assessed by RT-qPCR on circulating mononuclear cells.
14766,1555,RESULTS: ILC1 frequencies were increased in peripheral blood of patients with SLE as compared with healthy controls and correlate with disease activity in pSS patients.
14767,1555,"Overall, the frequencies of ILC2s or ILC3s did not differ between patients with SLE, pSS and healthy controls."
14768,1555,"However, patients with a high type I IFN signature expressed elevated levels of Fas on ILC2s and ILC3s, which coincided with decreased frequencies of these cells in blood."
14769,1555,"CONCLUSION: The presence of a type I IFN signature is related to Fas expression and frequencies of circulating ILC2s and ILC3s in patients with SLE and pSS, potentially altering the homeostatic balance of ILCs."
14770,1556,"In Sjgren's syndrome, like in most other autoimmune diseases, the enigma leading to a pathogenic attack against self has not yet been solved."
14771,1556,"By definition, the disease must be mediated by specific immune reactions against endogenous tissues to qualify as an autoimmune disease."
14772,1556,"In Sjgren's syndrome the autoimmune response is directed against the exocrine glands, which, as histopathological hallmark of the disease, display persistent and progressive focal mononuclear cell infiltrates."
14773,1556,"Clinically, the disease in most patients is manifested by two severe symptoms: dryness of the mouth (xerostomia) and the eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca)."
14774,1556,A number of systemic features have also been described and the presence of autoantibodies against the ubiquitously expressed ribonucleoprotein particles Ro (Sjgren's-syndrome-related antigen A - SSA) and La (SSB) further underline the systemic nature of Sjgren's syndrome.
14775,1556,"The original explanatory concept for the pathogenesis of Sjgren's syndrome proposed a specific, self-perpetuating, immune mediated loss of acinar and ductal cells as the principal cause of salivary gland hypofunction."
14776,1556,"Although straightforward and plausible, the hypothesis, however, falls short of accommodating several Sjgren's syndrome-related phenomena and experimental findings."
14777,1556,"Consequently, researchers considered immune-mediated salivary gland dysfunction prior to glandular destruction and atrophy as potential molecular mechanisms underlying the symptoms of dryness in Sjgren's syndrome."
14778,1556,"Accordingly, apoptosis, fibrosis and atrophy of the salivary glands would represent consequences of salivary gland hypofunction."
14779,1556,"The emergence of advanced bio-analytical platforms further enabled the identification of potential biomarkers with the intent to improve Sjgren's syndrome diagnosis, promote the development of prognostic tools for Sjgren's syndrome and the long-term goal to identify possible processes for therapeutic treatment interventions."
14780,1556,"In addition, such approaches allowed us to glimpse at the apparent complexity of Sjgren's syndrome."
14781,1557,"Interstitial lung disease is a common and often life-threatening manifestation of different connective tissue disorders, often affecting its overall prognosis."
14782,1557,"Systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjgren syndrome, and mixed connective tissue disease, although all unique diseases, can have lung manifestations as an important part of these conditions."
14783,1557,This article reviews the different pulmonary manifestations seen in these 3 systemic rheumatologic conditions.
14784,1558,OBJECTIVE: Germinal center (GC)-like structures have previously been observed in minor salivary glands (MSG) of patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS).
14785,1558,The aim of our study was to explore the prevalence and features of GC-like structures and B cell clonality in patients with pSS with and without lymphoma.
14786,1558,"METHODS: Based on a nationwide survey in Norway, we included 21 patients with pSS and with a concomitant lymphoma from whom MSG and/or lymphoma biopsies were available."
14787,1558,Tonsil biopsies and MSG from 28 patients with pSS without lymphoma were used as controls.
14788,1558,The presence of GC-like structures was investigated with H&E staining and double staining for CD21/IgD and CD38/IgD.
14789,1558,B cell clonality in MSG and tumors were investigated with analysis of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements.
14790,1558,RESULTS: H&E labeling of MSG revealed GC-like structures in 17/40 (43%) of the patients: 4/12 (33%) with and 13/28 (46%) without lymphoma.
14791,1558,Staining for CD21/CD38/IgD demonstrated CD21+ networks in 27/40 (68%) of the patients.
14792,1558,"CD21+/CD38- infiltrates were seen in 25/40 (63%) of the patients, and 16 of these were IgD+ within the infiltrate."
14793,1558,Five percent (2/40) of the patients presented with CD21+/CD38+ infiltrates resembling tonsillar GC.
14794,1558,Monoclonal B cell infiltration in MSG was present in 5/12 patients (42%) with and 5/28 patients (18%) without lymphoma (p=0.12).
14795,1558,"In 2/10 (20%) of cases where both MSG and lymphoma biopsies were available, identical clonal rearrangements were detected."
14796,1558,CONCLUSION: GC-like structures seen in H&E-stained MSG may represent various subtypes of CD21+ infiltrates.
14797,1558,"We were unable to detect a clear association between cellular infiltrates, B cell clonality, and lymphoma development."
14798,1559,"Connective tissue diseases (CTDs) comprise several immunologic systemic disorders, each of which associated with a particular set of clinical manifestations and autoimmune profile."
14799,1559,"CTDs may cause numerous thoracic abnormalities, which vary in frequency and pattern according to the underlying disorder."
14800,1559,"The CTDs that most commonly involve the respiratory system are progressive systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjgren syndrome, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and mixed connective tissue disease."
14801,1559,"Pulmonary abnormalities in this group of patients may result from CTD-related lung disease or treatment complications, namely drug toxicity and opportunistic infections."
14802,1559,"The most important thoracic manifestations of CTDs are interstitial lung disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension, with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia being the most common pattern of interstitial lung disease."
14803,1559,High-resolution computed tomography is a valuable tool in the initial evaluation and follow-up of patients with CTDs.
14804,1559,"As such, general knowledge of the most common high-resolution computed tomographic features of CTD-related lung disease allows the radiologist to contribute to better patient management."
14805,1560,"OBJECTIVES: Sjgren's syndrome is a complex and heterogeneous autoimmune disease characterised by ocular and oral dryness (1), which mainly affects the exocrine glands."
14806,1560,The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of sicca syndrome (SS) in the Peruvian population.
14807,1560,The age and gender of patients with SS and their national prevalence and in each of the departments were defined.
14808,1560,METHODS: This was a cross-sectional prevalence study.
14809,1560,All the people for whom the Ministry of Health (MINSA) in Peru covered health treatments from January to December 2016 were taken into account.
14810,1560,The patients with SS were either newly or previously diagnosed with sicca syndrome (Sjgren's) according to the international classification of diseases version 10 (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization (WHO).
14811,1560,The prevalence was determined considering the number of cases of SS in the total population registered by the Ministry of Health (MINSA).
14812,1560,"RESULTS: 1,301 cases of SS were observed in a total population of 15,417,345 people served in 25 territories."
14813,1560,"The prevalence of SS in this population was 0.0084%, the prevalence rate was 8.4 cases per 100,000 persons (95% CI: 7.99-8.91)."
14814,1560,"The prevalence of SS was higher in the territories of Tacna, Lima, La Libertad, Arequipa, Callao, and Apurmac."
14815,1560,"CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show the prevalence of SS in the Peruvian population and serve to strengthen the health strategies of rheumatology, ophthalmology, and oral health to improve the diagnosis, treatment, follow-up of the disease, and the quality of life of patients with SS."
14816,1561,"BACKGROUND: IgG4-related dacryoadenitis and sialoadenitis (IgG4-DS), so-called Mikulicz's disease, is characterized by elevated serum IgG4 and infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells in glandular tissues."
14817,1561,"Recently, several studies reported both malignant lymphoma developed on the background of IgG4-associated conditions and IgG4-producing malignant lymphoma (non-IgG4-related disease)."
14818,1561,CASE PRESENTATION: We report on the case of a 70-year-old man who was strongly suspected IgG4-DS because of high serum IgG4 concentration (215mg/dl) and bilateral swelling of parotid and submandibular glands.
14819,1561,Biopsies of cervical lymph node and a portion of submandibular gland were performed.
14820,1561,These histopathological findings subsequently confirmed a diagnosis of marginal zone B cell lymphoma.
14821,1561,"CONCLUSION: Differential diagnosis of IgG4-DS is necessary from other disorders, including Sjgren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, Castleman's disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, lymphoma, and cancer."
14822,1561,We suggest that biopsy of swollen lesions is important for a definitive diagnosis of IgG4-DS and discuss the mechanism of development in this case.
14823,1562,Smoking affects several disease processes.
14824,1562,Epidemiological studies have previously found a negative association between primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and smoking.
14825,1562,The aim of this study was to examine whether markers of disease activity and cytokine expression in pSS patients differ between ever and never smokers.
14826,1562,Fifty-one consecutive pSS patients and 33 population controls were included in the study.
14827,1562,Clinical and standard laboratory parameters were registered.
14828,1562,"Serum cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, IL-33, IFN-, IFN-, TNF-, EGF, BAFF, Fas-ligand, RANTES, TGF-1) were assessed."
14829,1562,A positive lip biopsy was less prevalent among ever smoking patients compared to never smokers (81 vs 100%; p=0.03).
14830,1562,"However, except for TNF-, which was higher in ever smokers, no differences in cytokine levels were found when comparing ever and never smoking pSS patients."
14831,1562,"Furthermore, no significant differences were found between ever and never smoking patients in the ESSDAI total score, IgG levels, or complement levels."
14832,1562,"However, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17 and IL-18 were significantly increased in pSS patients compared to controls."
14833,1562,"In this study, a negative association between ever smoking and positive lip biopsy was found, confirming previous reports."
14834,1562,"Expected differences in cytokine levels compared to controls were noted, but no major differences were found between ever and never smoking pSS patients."
14835,1562,"Taking into account the negative association between pSS diagnosis and smoking in epidemiological studies, possible explanations include a local effect of smoking on salivary glands rather than systemic effects by cigarette smoke."
14836,1563,"Benign lymphoepithelial lesions (BLLs) usually affect the parotid glands, resulting in their asymmetrical enlargement."
14837,1563,"The condition can be associated with Sjgren's syndrome (SS), which in turn may predispose the affected patient to the development of malignant lymphoma."
14838,1563,BLLs arising in the intraoral minor salivary glands are rare; such a lesion should prompt the work-up for SS.
14839,1563,"In some instances, a BLL of a minor salivary gland could represent the initial stage of a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma."
14840,1563,A case of BLL arising in the palatal minor salivary glands is reported here.
14841,1563,The importance of an appropriate diagnostic work-up is emphasized and the relationship of BLL with SS is reinforced.
14842,1564,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt-3L), a cytokine implicated in B cell ontogenesis and proliferation in hematologic malignancies, might be responsible for the increased numbers of circulating Bm2 and Bm2 B cell subsets in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
14843,1564,METHODS: Serum levels of Flt-3L were measured in 64 patients with primary SS and in 20 healthy controls matched for age and sex.
14844,1564,Flt-3L and its receptor Flt-3 were quantified in circulating B cells and in salivary gland (SG) biopsy tissues by immunofluorescence analysis.
14845,1564,The effect of Flt-3L on circulating B lymphocytes was then determined by coculture with cells of a human SG (HSG) epithelial cell line.
14846,1564,RESULTS: Serum levels of Flt-3L were increased in patients with primary SS as compared with controls (mean  SD 135.8  5.5 versus 64.4  4.5 pg/ml; P < 0.001).
14847,1564,"Serum levels of Flt-3L in primary SS patients correlated with the numbers of Bm2 and Bm2 cells (r = 0.46, P < 0.0006), and Flt-3 was selectively expressed in Bm2 and Bm2 cells."
14848,1564,B cell culture experiments showed that Flt-3L potentiated the proliferative effect of anti-IgM stimulation.
14849,1564,"In SGs, we found that infiltrating B cells expressed Flt-3 and epithelial cells produced Flt-3L."
14850,1564,"Finally, Flt-3L levels were associated with high disease activity scores and increased risk of developing lymphoma."
14851,1564,CONCLUSION: Serum levels of Flt-3L are elevated in patients with primary SS and correlate with abnormal B cell distribution.
14852,1564,Flt-3 is mainly expressed by Bm2 and Bm2 cells.
14853,1564,"Serum levels of Flt-3L might explain the clinical evolution of primary SS to B cell lymphoma that is observed in some patients, thus opening the possibility of new avenues for therapy."
14854,1565,Nuclear medicine studies evaluate physiology on a molecular level providing earlier detection of lesions before morphologic change is evident.
14855,1565,"(99m)Tc-MDP and (18)F-fluoride bone scans detect osteomyelitis earlier than radiographs and computed tomography (CT); aid in diagnosis of temporomandibular joint disorder; and evaluate activity of condylar hyperplasia, extent of Paget disease, and viability of bone grafts."
14856,1565,(18)F-FDG PET/CT distinguish between soft tissue and bone infections and diagnose osteomyelitis complicated by fracture or surgery.
14857,1565,"FDG PET is more accurate than CT alone and has a major role in staging, restaging, and assessing response to therapy for head and neck malignancies and in detecting sequelae of therapy."
14858,1566,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the fulfilment of classification criteria for cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis (CV) at diagnosis in a large cohort of patients with primary SS and their correlation with poor outcomes.
14859,1566,METHODS: We included 515 consecutive patients tested for serum cryoglobulins who fulfilled the 2002 classification criteria for primary SS.
14860,1566,CV classification criteria and serum cryoglobulins at diagnosis were assessed as predictors of death and lymphoma using Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis adjusted for age and gender.
14861,1566,"RESULTS: Positive serum cryoglobulins were detected in 65 (12%) patients, of whom 21 (32%) fulfilled CV classification criteria."
14862,1566,"Compared with patients positive for cryoglobulins who did not fulfil CV criteria, patients with CV had a higher frequency of type II cryoglobulinaemia (86% vs 43%, P = 0.04), a higher mean cryocrit level (6.58% vs 1.25%, P < 0.001) and a higher cumulated mean EULAR-SS disease activity index score (35.3 vs 16.2, P < 0.001)."
14863,1566,"After a mean follow-up of 110 months, 45 (9%) patients developed B-cell lymphoma and 33 (6%) died."
14864,1566,"Compared with patients without cryoglobulins, patients with cryoglobulins who fulfilled [hazard ratio (HR) = 7.47, 95% CI: 3.38, 16.53] and did not fulfil (HR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.03, 6.35) CV criteria both showed a higher risk of B-cell lymphoma in the univariate analysis, but not in the multivariate models."
14865,1566,"Compared with patients without cryoglobulins, patients with CV had a higher risk of death in both the univariate (HR = 11.68, 95% CI: 4.44, 30.74) and multivariate (HR = 4.36, 95% CI: 1.32, 14.47) models."
14866,1566,CONCLUSION: Patients with primary SS who fulfilled criteria for cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis at diagnosis are at higher risk of death.
14867,1567,"Patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) have an increased risk of developing lymphomas, particularly the subtype mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma."
14868,1567,Chronic antigen stimulation and increased activation of nuclear factor-B (NF-B) are important factors for the pathogenesis of MALT lymphomas.
14869,1567,Protein A20 is an inhibitor of NF-B.
14870,1567,"A recent study of pSS-associated MALT lymphomas identified potential functional abnormalities in the TNFAIP3 gene, which encodes protein A20."
14871,1567,The present study aimed to assess protein A20 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in minor salivary glands (MSGs) and lymphoma tissue sections of patients with pSS and investigate a potential association with lymphoma development.
14872,1567,"Protein A20 staining in lymphocytes was scored in four categories (0=negative, 1=weak, 2=moderate and 3=strong)."
14873,1567,"For statistical purposes, these scores were simplified into negative (scores 0-1) and positive (scores 2-3)."
14874,1567,"We investigated associations between protein A20-staining, focus scores, germinal centre (GC)-like structures and monoclonal B-cell infiltration in MSGs."
14875,1567,MSG protein A20 staining was weaker in pSS patients with lymphomas than in those without lymphomas (P=0.01).
14876,1567,Weak protein A20 staining was also highly associated with a lack of GC formation (P<0.01).
14877,1567,"Finally, weaker A20 staining was observed in the majority of pSS-associated MALT lymphoma tissues."
14878,1567,"In conclusion, we found absent or weak protein A20 immunoreactivity in MSGs of patients with pSS with lymphomas."
14879,1567,This finding indicates that protein A20 downregulation in lymphocytes might be a mechanism underlying lymphoma genesis in patients with pSS.
14880,1568,A 71 year-old man with primary Sjgren's syndrome developed pulmonary opacities within two years of the diagnosis.
14881,1568,"Videothoracoscopic lung biopsy demonstrated high grade, B-cell, CD20+, large-cell lymphoma, associated with Epstein-Barr virus (RNA EBERs of the virus were expressed by the lymphoma cells)."
14882,1568,"The condition initially improved with rituximab-CHOP treatment, but recurrence of the lymphoma was fatal."
14883,1568,CONCLUSION: High-grade B-cell lymphoma associated with EBV can occur in Sjgren's syndrome in the absence of long-term immunosuppressive therapy.
14884,1569,Abnormalities in B cell are characteristic feature of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
14885,1569,"As FcRIIb is a key regulator of B cells, the objective of this study is to investigate the role of the inhibitory receptor FcRIIb in B cells from pSS patients, and whether glucocorticoid can affect B cell subpopulations or FcRIIb expression."
14886,1569,Thirty pSS patients and 15 healthy controls were enrolled in this study.
14887,1569,The results showed that the percentage of memory CD19(+)CD27(+) B cells was significantly lower in pSS patients compared to in healthy controls.
14888,1569,FcRIIb expression on memory CD19(+)CD27(+) B cells from active pSS patients was significantly reduced compared with those from inactive or healthy controls.
14889,1569,The level of FcRIIb on memory CD19(+)CD27(+) B cells from active pSS patients was negatively correlated with anti-SSA antibody titers and Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index.
14890,1569,"After a high-dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy for 3days, FcRIIb expression on memory B cells was upregulated, with the raised level of platelets."
14891,1569,"In vitro, dexamethasone could elevate FcRIIb expression on B cells of pSS patients in a dose-dependent manner."
14892,1569,"Taken together, our data suggest that the upregulation of FcRIIb may be expected to be a new therapeutic strategy in pSS patients."
14893,1570,Pulmonary disease represents a significant extra-articular manifestation in the majority of connective tissue diseases (CTDs).
14894,1570,"The identification, classification, and staging of pulmonary involvement are centrally important to the management of patients, aiding the prognostication of disease behavior and treatment decisions."
14895,1570,We present a review of the high-resolution computed tomographic pulmonary features of CTD in the lung and their significance to the reporting radiologist.
14896,1571,"OBJECTIVE: Sjgren's Syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease, leading to deficient secretion from salivary and lacrimal glands."
14897,1571,"Saliva production is normally increased by cholinergic innervation, giving rise to intracellular calcium signaling and water transport through water channels (aquaporins, AQPs)."
14898,1571,"The aim of this study was to investigate possible pathophysiological changes in cell volume regulation, AQP expression and localization, and intracellular calcium signaling in glandular cells from SS patients compared to controls."
14899,1571,MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 35 SS patients and 41 non-SS controls were included.
14900,1571,"Real time qPCR was combined with immunohistochemistry to analyze the mRNA expression and cellular distribution of AQP1, 3 and 5."
14901,1571,Cell volume regulation and intracellular calcium signaling were examined in fresh acinar cells.
14902,1571,"RESULTS: We show for the first time a reduced mRNA expression of AQP1 and 5 in SS compared to controls, accompanied by a decrease in staining intensity of AQP1, 3 and 5 in areas adjacent to local lymphocytic infiltration."
14903,1571,"Furthermore, we observed that the SS cells' capacity for volume regulation was abnormal."
14904,1571,"Similarly, the calcium response after parasympathetic agonist (carbachol) stimulation was markedly decreased in SS cells."
14905,1571,"CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that mRNA expression of AQP1 and 5, protein distribution of AQP1, 3 and 5, glandular cell volume regulation and intracellular calcium signaling are all altered in SS, pointing to possible pathophysiological mechanisms in SS."
14906,1572,"OBJECTIVES: Whereas antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) have diagnostic significance, the dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern on HEp-2 cells may be an exclusionary marker for ANA-associated rheumatic disease (AARD)."
14907,1572,The aim of this study was to evaluate a new algorithm considering anti-DFS70 antibodies for routine ANA testing.
14908,1572,"METHOD: From ANA requested sequential 10528 sera, 181 sera samples showing the DFS pattern were additionally tested for anti-DFS70 antibodies by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA-DFS70) and for specific-ANAs."
14909,1572,Specific-ANAs(+)/IIF-DFS(-) control sera samples (n=50) were also tested.
14910,1572,"RESULTS: Of the 181 IIF-DFS-positive sera samples, 82.9% (n=150) were from non-AARD patients and 112 (61.9%) patients had non-rheumatic diseases (NRD), including the most common clinical feature of dermatitis (18.2%)."
14911,1572,The ELISA-DFS70 was positive in 109 (60.2%) sera and was negative in all control sera.
14912,1572,"Specific-ANAs were similarly detected as 25.7% (28/109) and 22.2% (16/72) of ELISA-DFS70(+) and ELISA-DFS70(+) patients, respectively (p>0.05)."
14913,1572,"The prevalence of non-AARD was 95.1% and 25.1% in the ELISA-DFS70(+)/specific-ANAs(-) and ELISA-DFS70(-)/specific-ANAs (+) groups, respectively."
14914,1572,"CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a HEp-2 DFS pattern, the additional ELISA-DFS70 and specific-ANAs test could improve the efficiency of diagnosing AARD."
14915,1572,The detection of anti-DFS70 antibodies should be included in test algorithms for ANA testing.
14916,1573,OBJECTIVES: To determine mortality and long-term survival factors in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
14917,1573,METHODS: Retrospective observational study including all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of any systemic autoimmune disease admitted to the medical ICU in a tertiary hospital between 1999 and 2007.
14918,1573,Factors associated with reduced survival were identified by means of log rank test and backward stepwise Cox regression.
14919,1573,RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (26 females) were included with median age being 44.3 years (interquartilic range [IQR]: 31.3).
14920,1573,"Sixteen (43.2%) patients had systemic lupus erythematosus, 9 (24.3%) had systemic vasculitis, 4 (10.8%) had systemic sclerosis and 4 (10.8%) had primary antiphospholipid syndrome."
14921,1573,"The main reason for ICU admission was autoimmune disease flare-up in 20 (54.0%) patients, followed by infections in 12 (32.4%)."
14922,1573,Median APACHE II at admission was 17 (IQR 7).
14923,1573,"At the end of follow-up, 15 (40.5%) patients died, 10 (27%) during hospitalisation (7 in the ICU) and 5 after hospital discharge."
14924,1573,"Factors associated with reduced long-term survival were: APACHE II score 18 (HR 6.02, 95% CI 1.76-20.62), age <45 years (HR 6.54, 95% CI 1.84-23.29), presence of any previous chronic disease (HR 18.20, 95% CI 3.72-88.96), and increase of corticosteroid therapy during ICU stay (HR 22.87, 95% CI 4.31-121.30)."
14925,1573,"CONCLUSIONS: The long-term survival of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases admitted to the ICU was related with age, higher APACHE II score, previous chronic diseases, and an increase in corticosteroids dose when comparing with previous ICU admissions."
14926,1574,"Primary Sjgrens syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by dry eyes, dry mouth, and other clinical manifestations."
14927,1574,The most common extraglandular manifestation of pSS is articular involvement and to date their management is unclear.
14928,1574,The aims of the current pilot study were to assess the safety and the outcomes of homologous platelet-rich plasma (HPRP) injections in pSS cohort affected by knee arthralgia/arthritis at short-term follow up.
14929,1574,This pilot study provides the first evidence that HPRP injections are a safe treatment and induce a short-term clinical improvement.
14930,1574,"Although the lack of a control group, randomization and long-term follow up prevents the assessment of the real effectiveness of this treatment, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine the mechanism of action, biological changes and disease-modifying properties of PRP."
14931,1575,"Amicrobial pustulosis associated with autoimmune disease (APAD) is a rare clinical condition, characterized by relapsing pustular eruption, affecting mainly the skin folds."
14932,1575,Almost all previously described cases were young women with varying underlying autoimmune diseases.
14933,1575,"We report a 36-year-old woman with the interesting triad of APAD, Sjgren syndrome and IgA nephropathy."
14934,1575,Her rashes responded to oral prednisolone and cyclophosphamide.
14935,1576,"Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies, which were described for the first time in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjgren's syndrome (SS), are the most prevalent extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) specificity identified in laboratories."
14936,1576,"Two types of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies have been described, anti-SSA-52 kDa (aSSA52) and anti-SSA-60 kDa (aSSA60), each specific to different antigens."
14937,1576,Anti-Ro/SSA52 autoantibodies are more frequent than other autoantibodies possibly because of the antigen's accessible and ubiquitous nature.
14938,1576,The sites involved and the symptoms associated with these autoantibodies depend on the antigen's structural variability.
14939,1576,Isolated congenital complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) shows a close association with maternal anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies; the highest relative risks of CAVB are seen in offspring of mothers with antibodies against 52-kDa Ro and 48-kDa La proteins.
14940,1576,"Anti-Ro/SSA52 antibodies have little impact on adult rheumatic autoimmune diseases or adult cardiac arrhythmias, but the course of autoimmune liver diseases is greatly worsened by their presence, and solid tumours tend to relapse."
14941,1576,"Their diagnostic role in rheumatic diseases is controversial, although a significant association between isolated anti-Ro/SSA52-kDa positivity and myositis and to a lesser extent with systemic sclerosis (SSc) has been described."
14942,1576,"However, the majority of the specific diagnosis is mostly based on the simultaneous presence of other autoantibodies that seems diagnostically more relevant."
14943,1577,Pulmonary amyloidosis in the setting of Sjogren syndrome is rare.
14944,1577,It most commonly presents in form of multinodular disease with or without cysts formation.
14945,1577,"Amyloid plaques may also deposit in the airway submucosa, causing airway narrowing; the condition referred as ""tracheobronchial amyloidosis"" (TBA)."
14946,1577,"Patients with this condition most commonly present with postobstructive pneumonia, wheezing, and occasionally hemoptysis."
14947,1577,"Endoscopic therapies, using flexible forceps with or without laser therapy is crucial to alleviate the obstruction and control the bleeding."
14948,1577,"Other therapeutic modalities such as external beam radiation has been shown to be promising; however, further data are still needed."
14949,1577,"To our knowledge, our patient is the first reported case of TBA in a setting of Sjogren syndrome."
14950,1578,BACKGROUND: Sjgren syndrome (SS) is associated with xerostomia and xerophthalmia.
14951,1578,Pilocarpine has been shown to stimulate the secretion of saliva.
14952,1578,OBJECTIVES: To investigate and compare the efficacy of pilocarpine and artificial saliva as symptomatic treatments for xerostomia and xerophthalmia in patients with SS.
14953,1578,METHODS: A double-blind randomized controlled study was performed.
14954,1578,"A total of 72 patients with SS were assigned randomly to receive 10 drops of pilocarpine (5mg) or 10 drops of artificial saliva orally, three times daily for 12weeks."
14955,1578,Whole saliva and tear flow were evaluated at baseline and periodically throughout the study to provide a global assessment of dryness and to report any adverse effects.
14956,1578,"RESULTS: Patients receiving pilocarpine had a statistically significant improvement in their salivary flow (P<0001), lacrimal flow (P<0001) and their subjective global assessment (P<0001), compared with patients who received artificial saliva."
14957,1578,The most common side-effects were sialorrhoea and nausea.
14958,1578,CONCLUSIONS: Pilocarpine is more effective than artificial saliva for enhancing salivary and lacrimal secretion in patients with SS.
14959,1578,This is the first study to compare the efficacy of pilocarpine and artificial saliva for the treatment of xerostomia and xerophthalmia in SS.
14960,1579,"BACKGROUND Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is one of the most common chronic systemic autoimmune diseases, and thrombocytopenia is one of the hematological manifestations of pSS."
14961,1579,"When platelet and endothelial cells are activated, P-selectin is expressed on the cell surface."
14962,1579,This study aimed to investigate the role of P-selectin autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia in pSS.
14963,1579,"MATERIAL AND METHODS P-selectin autoantibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 38 pSS patients without thrombocytopenia and 32 pSS patients with thrombocytopenia, 32 idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients, and 35 healthy controls."
14964,1579,"RESULTS The plasma P-selectin autoantibodies (A490) in ITP patients and pSS patients with/without thrombocytopenia were significantly higher than those in healthy controls, but there were no significant differences between ITP patients and pSS patients with thrombocytopenia."
14965,1579,The positive rate of P-selectin autoantibodies in pSS patients with thrombocytopenia was significantly higher than that in ITP patients.
14966,1579,"The platelet count was lower in P-selectin autoantibodies-positive patients, while among pSS patients with thrombocytopenia, the platelet count was lower in P-selectin autoantibodies-positive patients than in P-selectin autoantibodies-negative patients."
14967,1579,"In ITP patients and pSS patients with thrombocytopenia, the platelet count was lower in P-selectin autoantibodies-positive patients."
14968,1579,CONCLUSIONS Elevated plasma P-selectin autoantibodies may play a role in the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia in pSS patients.
14969,1580,"To analyze the clinical characteristics of severe thrombocytopenia in patients with various connective tissue diseases (CTDs), one hundred thirty-one consecutive CTD patients with blood platelet count less than 2010(9)/L on admission, which was ascribed to the nature of diseases, during January 2011 to June 2015 in our department were enrolled and checked for their survival status in September 2015."
14970,1580,"The patients were categorized based on background diseases or therapeutic effects, and compared with clinical features, treatment strategies, and long-term outcomes among the groups."
14971,1580,Cumulative survival rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
14972,1580,"Of the patients, 88.5% were female."
14973,1580,The most frequently seen background diseases were primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) (53.4%) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (40.5%).
14974,1580,"Age on admission for SLE patients (36.714.1years) was much younger than that for other patients (44.415.4years for pSS and 4616.1years for other CTDs, p<0.05)."
14975,1580,"Ninety-six cases accompanied with various bleeding symptoms, which were more common in pSS patients than in SLE patients (80.0% vs. 64.2%, p<0.05)."
14976,1580,Glucocorticoids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin were applied as initial therapy with an overall response rate of 36.6%.
14977,1580,"For patients failed to respond, immunosuppressive drugs were added and the other 22.8% benefited from the treatment."
14978,1580,"Compared to those ineffective to the aforementioned drugs, patients with therapeutic effects had significantly high immunoglobulin G levels."
14979,1580,Twenty patients with refractory diseases accepted mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT) with a total effective rate of 65.0%.
14980,1580,"Eleven patients died after the follow-up for a mean time of 27.7months, of which 7 were associated with hemorrhage."
14981,1580,There was no difference in the survival rate among different background diseases.
14982,1580,"However, compared with those who did not gain remission, patients achieved partial or complete remission had better cumulative survival rates (p<0.01)."
14983,1580,"In conclusion, among various CTDs, severe thrombocytopenia often occurs in patients with SLE or pSS."
14984,1580,"Early response to the treatments, but not the background disease, is an important predictor of long-term prognosis."
14985,1580,"For patients with refractory thrombocytopenia, MSCT may provide an alternative therapeutic strategy."
14986,1581,"Five different laminin (LM) alpha, four LM-beta, and three LM-gamma chains form the 15-16 currently known approximately 400-900 kDa heterodimeric LM-monomers, which self-assemble in the lamina lucida of the basement membrane (BM) to a network, connected with nidogens and perlecans with the underlying type IV collagen network."
14987,1581,"In labial salivary glands (LSG), the structurally organizing/polarizing BM separates the tubuloacinar epithelium from the connective tissue stroma but plays regulatory roles as well."
14988,1581,"Tissue distribution of LM-alpha, -beta, and -gamma chains is described, and application of the known combinatorial rules allows some conclusions also on the corresponding distribution of the LM-trimers."
14989,1581,"Currently, known integrin (Int) and non integrin (e.g., dystroglycans and Lutheran blood group antigens) LM-receptors are described."
14990,1581,"LMs are regulated at transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational levels, together with the regulation of alternative splicing, binding partners (assembly), secretion, and degradation."
14991,1581,"In LSGs, LM-alpha1, -alpha2, and -alpha4 are only found in the acinar (not ductal) BM, LM-alpha4 also in the periductal/ interstitial stroma."
14992,1581,"Pattern recognition disclosed irregular expression in the acinar BM, suggesting some dynamic and/or regulatory role."
14993,1581,"It seems that in a female-dominant autoimmune exocrinopathy, Sjgren's syndrome (SS), LM-alpha1 and -alpha2 are decreased, together with their Int alpha1beta1 and alpha2beta1 receptors."
14994,1581,"Because LM-111/211-to-Int-alpha1beta1/alpha2beta1 interactions play a crucial role in the transdifferentiation of the intercalated duct progenitors to secretory acinar cells, acinar remodeling is impaired in SS."
14995,1581,Disturbed hemidesmosomal Int alpha6beta4/LM-332 interactions in SS may lead to acinar cell anoikis.
14996,1581,"Interestingly, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) prohormone and its intracrine androgenic dihydrotestosterone (DHT) end product upregulate at least Int alpha1beta1/alpha2beta1, whereas LM-alpha1 is upregulated by outside-in LM-111/211-to-Int-alpha1beta1/alpha2beta1 signaling."
14997,1581,"It seems that LM alterations precede the lymphocyte infiltration, suggesting that acinar BM-Int pathology, perhaps related to endo- and intracrine sex steroid metabolism, represents an early pathogenic phases in SS."
14998,1582,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune epithelitis characterized by mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltration of the lacrimal and salivary glands (SG), as well as the presence of serum autoantibodies."
14999,1582,This condition is a growing public health concern in Algeria.
15000,1582,"Herein, we sought to determine if the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A, and nitric oxide (NO), were correlated with the extent of MNC infiltration."
15001,1582,"The expression of inducible NO synthase (NOS2) and CD68 was measured in the SG of all patients, but not in those of the normal controls (NCs)."
15002,1582,We included 44 primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients and 15 NCs in this study; we found that the expression of NOS2 and CD68 was elevated in all of the SG of SS patients.
15003,1582,"Additionally, the serum and saliva levels of IL-6, IL-17A, and NO were higher in the pSS patients, compared with the NCs."
15004,1582,"Furthermore, the NOS2-induced excess NO was associated with the extent of the MNC infiltration, and thereby with tissue injury."
15005,1582,"It is also important to note that there were correlations between the levels of IL-6, IL-17A, and NO."
15006,1582,"Such findings indicate that through the effects of NO, IL-17A participates in the pathophysiology of the disease."
15007,1582,"With the purpose of improving both the diagnosis and prognosis, IL-6, IL-17A, and NO should be assayed in the serum and saliva of patients suspected of SS."
15008,1583,INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to show the clinical and pathological characteristics of anti-centromere-antibody (ACA)-seropositive Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in two anti-human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-seropositive patients.
15009,1583,METHODS: One patient was an HTLV-I carrier whereas the other was diagnosed with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM).
15010,1583,"Background data including serum HTLV-I titers, viral loads, and cytokine profiles were recorded."
15011,1583,Azocarmine with aniline blue (Azan)-Mallory staining and immunohistochemistry of the labial salivary glands (LSGs) and a muscle biopsy specimen from the HAM patient were performed.
15012,1583,"RESULTS: Serum transforming growth factor beta (TGF-), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), and HTLV-I viral load were high in the HAM-SS patient compared with the HTLV-I carrier."
15013,1583,Fibrous change in LSG was prominent in the HAM-SS patient.
15014,1583,"Although TGF- expression was similar in the two patients, expression of HTLV-I-related proteins including p12, p28, group-specific antigen (GAG), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-B) in the LSG were dominantly detected in the HAM-SS patient."
15015,1583,"Frequency of TGF- staining in HTLV-I-seropositive SS patients without ACA, HTLV-I-seronegative SS patients with ACA, and HTLV-I-seronegative SS patients without ACA was lower than that of the previous two patients."
15016,1583,"CONCLUSION: A high HTLV-I viral load in situ is supposed to promote the production of cytokines, especially TGF-, resulting in the fibrous change of LSG in ACA-seropositive SS patients."
15017,1584,BACKGROUND: The association of macrophage activation syndrome and primary Sjgren's syndrome has been rarely reported in the literature.
15018,1584,"We report the first observation of this association in Africa, south of the Sahara, and we discuss the diagnosis and therapeutic challenge."
15019,1584,CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old Mauritanian and Berberwoman was followed for primary Sjgren's syndrome.
15020,1584,"After a voluntary cessation of her usual background treatment, she was admitted to our department for an outbreak of her illness."
15021,1584,"A clinical examination revealed anemic syndrome, peripheral polyarthritis, coughing rales at both pulmonary bases, and fever at 39.5C."
15022,1584,"On biologic examination, there was bicytopenia with anemia at 5.70g/dl, lymphopenia at 796/mm(3), a biological inflammatory syndrome with a sedimentation rate at 137mm in the first hour, C-reactive protein at 97mg/l, hyperferritinemia at 1778mg/l (9normal value), and hypergammaglobulinemia at 20.7g/l of polyclonal appearance."
15023,1584,The triglycerides were 1.95g/l (1.4normal value) and the lactate dehydrogenase level was 491IU/l (1.5normal value).
15024,1584,Cytological examination of a medullary puncture revealed an image of hemophagocytosis.
15025,1584,An infectious screening was negative.
15026,1584,Thoracic computed tomography showed non-specific interstitial lung disease.
15027,1584,"A diagnosis of macrophage activation syndrome complicating primary Sjgren's syndrome was selected with a probability of 97.2%, according to H-Score."
15028,1584,The evolution was favorable under a treatment including etoposide (VP-16).
15029,1584,"CONCLUSION: Macrophage activation syndrome is a rare entity, rarely reported during primary Sjgren's syndrome."
15030,1584,Its spontaneous evolution is invariably fatal.
15031,1584,There is no consensus on therapeutic treatment.
15032,1584,Etoposide is a therapeutic option especially in forms refractory to corticosteroid therapy.
15033,1585,IgG4-related sclerosing sialadenitis is currently considered as an autoimmune disease distinct from Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and responds extremely well to steroid therapy.
15034,1585,"To further elucidate the characteristics of IgG4-related sclerosing sialadenitis, we analysed VH fragments of IgH genes and their somatic hypermutation in SS (n = 3) and IgG4-related sclerosing sialadenitis (n = 3), using sialolithiasis (n = 3) as a non-autoimmune control."
15035,1585,DNA was extracted from the affected inflammatory lesions.
15036,1585,"After PCR amplification of rearranged IgH genes, at least 50 clones per case (more than 500 clones in total) were sequenced for VH fragments."
15037,1585,Monoclonal IgH rearrangement was not detected in any cases examined.
15038,1585,"When compared with sialolithiasis, there was no VH family or VH fragment specific to SS or IgG4-related sclerosing sialadenitis."
15039,1585,"However, rates of unmutated VH fragments in SS (30%) and IgG4-related sclerosing sialadenitis (39%) were higher than that in sialolithiasis (14%) with statistical significance (P = 0.0005 and P < 0.0001, respectively)."
15040,1585,This finding suggests that some autoantibodies encoded by germline or less mutated VH genes may fail to be eliminated and could play a role in the development of SS and IgG4-related sclerosing sialadenitis.
15041,1586,"One of identical twin girls was born with ulcers on her leg, and shortly after birth developed a flaccid blister on the leg."
15042,1586,Subepidermal blister with vacuolar degeneration of basal cell layer and the heavy infiltration of mononuclear cells in the upper dermis were observed in the blister lesion.
15043,1586,She also had generalized livedo.
15044,1586,"Her identical twin sister did not exhibit ulcers or blisters, but was born with milia on her limbs."
15045,1586,Their mother was found to have lupus erythematosus with positive anti-Ro/SSA antibodies and developed Sjgren syndrome.
15046,1586,We emphasize neonatal blistering and congenital milia unique manifestations of neonatal lupus erythematosus.
15047,1587,"Despite being one of the most common rheumatologic diseases, there is still no disease-modifying drug for primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
15048,1587,Advancing our knowledge of the target tissue has been limited by the low dimensionality of histology techniques and the small size of human salivary gland biopsies.
15049,1587,"In this study, we took advantage of a molecularly validated mouse model of pSS to characterize tissue-infiltrating CD4(+) T cells and their regulation by the lymphotoxin/LIGHT signaling axis."
15050,1587,Novel cell subsets were identified by combining highly dimensional flow and mass cytometry with transcriptomic analyses.
15051,1587,"Pharmacologic modulation of the LTR signaling pathway was achieved by treating mice with LTR-Ig, a therapeutic intervention currently being tested in pSS patients (Baminercept trial NCT01552681)."
15052,1587,"Using these approaches, we identified two novel CD4(+) T cell subsets characterized by high levels of PD1: Prdm1(+) effector regulatory T cells expressing immunoregulatory factors, such as Il10, Areg, Fgl2, and Itgb8, and Il21(+) effector conventional T cells expressing a pathogenic transcriptional signature."
15053,1587,"Mirroring these observations in mice, large numbers of CD4(+)PD1(+) T cells were detected in salivary glands from Sjgren's patients but not in normal salivary glands or kidney biopsies from lupus nephritis patients."
15054,1587,"Unexpectedly, LTR-Ig selectively halted the recruitment of PD1(-) naive, but not PD1(+), effector T cells to the target tissue, leaving the cells with pathogenic potential unaffected."
15055,1587,"Altogether, this study revealed new cellular players in pSS pathogenesis, their transcriptional signatures, and differential dependency on the lymphotoxin/LIGHT signaling axis that help to interpret the negative results of the Baminercept trial and will guide future therapeutic interventions."
15056,1588,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 18-25 nucleotide long, single stranded, endogenous, non-coding small RNAs playing an important role in regulating gene expression at posttranscriptional level."
15057,1588,"miRNAs control approximately 90% of protein-coding genes, and play a central role in various biological processes including immune cell lineage commitment, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and maintenance of immune homeostasis."
15058,1588,"Changes in the expression of certain miRNAs may lead to the development of many diseases, including systemic autoimmune diseases."

15063,1589,Sjgren syndrome (SS) is commonly known to be correlated with lymphoma.
15064,1589,"This study included 16,396 individuals in the SS cohort and 65,584 individuals in the non-SS cohort, all of whom were enrolled in the Taiwan National Health Insurance database between 2000 and 2010."
15065,1589,We evaluated the risk factors of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in the primary SS cohort by applying a Cox multivariable proportional-hazards model.
15066,1589,"We increased the correlation of patients with SS and NHL, with an adjusted HR of 4.314 (95% CI 2.784 - 6.685)."
15067,1589,"Of the 16,396 SS patients, 66 individuals had salivary gland slices without NHL development, while the other 16,330 individuals that did not have salivary gland slices revealed 30 individuals that developed NHL."
15068,1589,"Of the 16,396 SS patients, 128 individuals underwent immunomodulator agent therapy (including hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and rituximab) without NHL development."
15069,1589,None of the 30 individuals that developed NHL from SS received immunomodulator agents.
15070,1589,"We found that patients with SS were at an increased risk of developing NHL, with the most common NHL subgroup being diffused large B-cell lymphoma."
15071,1589,SS patients who were candidates for salivary gland slices or immunomodulator agents were associated with a lower risk of developing lymphoma over time.
15072,1589,We recommend that patients at a higher risk upon diagnosis of SS receive close follow-up and aggressive treatment.
15073,1590,"IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a systemic disease characterized by the elevation of serum IgG4 and infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells in multiple target organs, including the pancreas, kidney, biliary tract and salivary glands."
15074,1590,"In contrast, Mikulicz's disease (MD) has been considered a subtype of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) based on histopathological similarities."
15075,1590,"However, it is now recognized that MD is an IgG4-RD distinguishable from SS and called as IgG4-related dacryoadenitis and sialoadenitis (IgG4-DS)."
15076,1590,"Regarding immunological aspects, it is generally accepted that CD4+ T helper (Th) cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SS."
15077,1590,"Since it is well known that IgG4 is induced by Th2 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, IgG4-DS is speculated to be a unique inflammatory disorder characterized by Th2 immune reactions."
15078,1590,"However, the involvement of Th cells in the pathogenesis of IgG4-DS remains to be clarified."
15079,1590,Exploring the role of Th cell subsets in IgG4-DS is a highly promising field of investigation.
15080,1590,"In this review, we focus on the selective localization and respective functions of Th cell subsets and discuss the differences between SS and IgG4-DS to clarify the pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases."
15081,1591,"We performed a candidate gene association study in 540 patients with primary Sjgren's Syndrome (SS) from Sweden (n=344) and Norway (n=196) and 532 controls (n=319 Swedish, n=213 Norwegian)."
15082,1591,A total of 1139 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 84 genes were analyzed.
15083,1591,"In the meta-analysis of the Swedish and Norwegian cohorts, we found high signals for association between primary SS and SNPs in three gene loci, not previously associated with primary SS."
15084,1591,"These are the early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) gene, P=9.9  10(-5), OR 1.68, the family with sequence similarity 167 member A-B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase (FAM167A-BLK) locus, P=4.7  10(-4), OR 1.37 and the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF4=Ox40L) gene, P=7.4  10(-4), OR 1.34."
15085,1591,We also confirmed the association between primary SS and the IRF5/TNPO3 locus and the STAT4 gene.
15086,1591,We found no association between the SNPs in these five genes and the presence of anti-SSA/anti-SSB antibodies.
15087,1591,"EBF1, BLK and TNFSF4 are all involved in B-cell differentiation and activation, and we conclude that polymorphisms in several susceptibility genes in the immune system contribute to the pathogenesis of primary SS."
15088,1592,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in patients with Sjgren syndrome remains unclear owing to conflicting results in the published series, with numbers ranging from 2% to over 60% of Sjgren syndrome patients."
15089,1592,Whether peripheral neuropathy is a feature of the systemic or glandular disease or whether it is related to a circulating antineuronal antibody remains also uncertain.
15090,1592,"METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS), fulfilling the Revised European-American Classification Criteria, seen in their department from 1992 to 2009."
15091,1592,The patients with previously recorded neuropathic features were re-examined clinically and electrophysiologically.
15092,1592,Other causes of polyneuropathy were excluded.
15093,1592,The authors also searched for circulating antineural antibodies using immunofluorescence and western blot and for antibodies against muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as potential biomarkers.
15094,1592,RESULTS: 509 cases met the diagnostic criteria for pSS.
15095,1592,"Among these, 44 patients were recorded as having neuropathic symptoms."
15096,1592,"After completing the evaluation, however, only nine (1.8%) had polyneuropathy with objective clinical signs and abnormal electrophysiological findings."
15097,1592,"The neuropathy was axonal in all, in five pure sensory and in four sensorimotor."
15098,1592,The patients with peripheral neuropathy had extraglandular manifestations such as palpable purpura and vasculitis.
15099,1592,"No evidence of antineural autoimmunity was found, and no candidate biomarkers were identified."
15100,1592,CONCLUSION: Polyneuropathy is a rare manifestation of pSS occurring in 1.8% of patients.
15101,1592,"In the majority of patients, it is a late event and frequently associated with systemic disease or risk factors for lymphoma development."
15102,1593,"An 83-year-old female began treatment with prednisolone and ursodeoxycholic acid at 62years of age, following a diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and secondary Sjgren's syndrome (SjS)."
15103,1593,"With persisting bloody stools, the patient underwent colonoscopy at 83years of age."
15104,1593,Histopathological evaluation revealed mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.
15105,1593,The elevated rectal lesion resolved with rituximab treatment.
15106,1593,"We report this case because although patients with SjS are at increased risk of malignant lymphoma, primary rectal MALT lymphoma is very uncommon in association with PBC and secondary SjS."
15107,1594,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of preclinical systemic autoimmune rheumatic disorders on pregnancy outcome.
15108,1594,"METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study, patients were enrolled during the first trimester of pregnancy if they reported having had connective tissue disorder symptoms, were found to be positive for circulating autoantibodies, and on clinical evaluation were judged to have a preclinical or incomplete rheumatic disorder."
15109,1594,"The incidence of fetal growth restriction (FGR), preeclampsia, and adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with preclinical rheumatic disorders was compared with that in selected controls, after adjustment for confounders by penalized logistic regression."
15110,1594,Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.
15111,1594,"RESULTS: Of 5,232 women screened, 150 (2.9%) were initially diagnosed as having a suspected rheumatic disorder."
15112,1594,"After a meanSD postpartum follow-up of 16.75.5 months, 64 of these women (42.7%) had no clinically apparent rheumatic disease and 86 (57.3%) had persistent symptoms and positive autoantibody results, including 10 (6.7%) who developed a definitive rheumatic disease."
15113,1594,"The incidences of preeclampsia/FGR and of small for gestational age (SGA) infants were 5.1% (23 of 450) and 9.3% (42 of 450), respectively, among controls, 12.5% (8 of 640) (OR 2.7 [95% CI 1.1-6.4]) and 18.8% (12 of 64) (OR 2.2 [95% CI 1.1-4.5]), respectively, among women with no clinically apparent disease, and 16.3% (14 of 86) (OR 3.8 [95% CI 1.9-7.7]) and 18.6% (16 of 86) (OR 2.3 [95% CI 1.2-4.3]), respectively, among those with persisting symptoms at follow-up."
15114,1594,"MeanSD umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility indices were higher among women with no clinically apparent disease (0.950.2) and those with persisting symptoms (0.960.21) than in controls (0.890.12) (P=0.01 and P<0.001, respectively)."
15115,1594,"CONCLUSION: In our study population, preclinical rheumatic disorders were associated with an increased risk of FGR/preeclampsia and SGA."
15116,1594,The impact of these findings and their utility in screening for FGR/preeclampsia need to be confirmed in population studies.
15117,1595,BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases.
15118,1595,It mainly involves the joints and also affects directly or indirectly nearly all organ systems.
15119,1595,The question whether RA causes exocrine pancreatic disfunction remains unclear.
15120,1595,The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether or not RA contributes to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.
15121,1595,This was done by ruling out seconder Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) by using Schirmer's test.
15122,1595,"METHODS: A total of 60 patients (20 RA, 20 RA + SjS and 20 SjS) and 20 healthy volunteers were included in the study."
15123,1595,Patients with RA who had not undergonethe Schirmer's test in the last 6 months and all healthy volunteers included in the study underwent the Schirmer's test at an outpatient clinic.
15124,1595,Random fecal samples were taken from all participants and fecal pancreatic elastase was measured to evaluate pancreatic exocrine functions.
15125,1595,"RESULTS: In the study, a statistically significant difference was found between the control group,SjS and RA+SjS groups."
15126,1595,But there was no significant difference between the control group and RA group.
15127,1595,"In RA group, fecal elastase levels were statistically significantly higher compared to the SjS group."
15128,1595,But there was no significant difference between RA+SjS and SjS groups.
15129,1595,CONCLUSION: Fecal elastase significantly decreased in SjS compared to the normal population while pancreatic exocrine functions are considered to be impaired in SjS.
15130,1595,There are also impaired pancreatic exocrine functions in the secondary SjS associated with RA.
15131,1595,"Consequently, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, which can be seen in patients with RA, may be thought to be caused by secondary SjS associated with RA (Tab."

15135,1596,OBJECTIVE: To estimate systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD) prevalence across 7 Canadian provinces using population-based administrative data evaluating both regional variations and the effects of age and sex.
15136,1596,"METHODS: Using provincial physician billing and hospitalization data, cases of SARD (systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, primary Sjgren syndrome, polymyositis/dermatomyositis) were ascertained."
15137,1596,"Three case definitions (rheumatology billing, 2-code physician billing, and hospital diagnosis) were combined to derive a SARD prevalence estimate for each province, categorized by age, sex, and rural/urban status."
15138,1596,A hierarchical Bayesian latent class regression model was fit to account for the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of each case definition.
15139,1596,The model also provided sensitivity estimates of different case definition approaches.
15140,1596,RESULTS: Prevalence estimates for overall SARD ranged between 2 and 5 cases per 1000 residents across provinces.
15141,1596,"Similar demographic trends were evident across provinces, with greater prevalence in women and in persons over 45 years old."
15142,1596,SARD prevalence in women over 45 was close to 1%.
15143,1596,"Overall sensitivity was poor, but estimates for each of the 3 case definitions improved within older populations and were slightly higher for men compared to women."
15144,1596,"CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with previous estimates and other North American findings, and provide results from coast to coast, as well as useful information about the degree of regional and demographic variations that can be seen within a single country."
15145,1596,"Our work demonstrates the usefulness of using multiple data sources, adjusting for the error in each, and providing estimates of the sensitivity of different case definition approaches."
15146,1597,OBJECTIVES: To determine whether taking hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) could prevent the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) among patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS).
15147,1597,"METHODS: This is a nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study utilizing the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD)."
15148,1597,"Data were collected from 1 January 1999, through 31 December 2013, using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes."
15149,1597,"In total, 7774 patients newly diagnosed with SS by at least three outpatient visits or one inpatient admission were selected from the NHIRD as participants."
15150,1597,Patients who had previously been diagnosed with DM and whose follow-up durations shorter than 90 days were excluded.
15151,1597,"HCQ exposure group includes patients who had been diagnosed with SS no longer than 180 days previously, and had been prescribed HCQ for the first time for at least 90 days."
15152,1597,The diagnosis of DM was defined as at least two outpatient visits or one inpatient admission with anti-diabetic medication prescription.
15153,1597,"RESULTS: Patients with SS treated with HCQ had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of new-onset DM than those not treated with HCQ (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.51, 95% confidence interval: 0.28-0.96, P < 0.05)."
15154,1597,"HCQ use for 3 years or more had favorable protective effects (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.22, CI: 0.05-0.92)."
15155,1597,CONCLUSIONS: HCQ reduced the incidence of DM in a time and dose-dependent manner.
15156,1597,Patients with SS who had taken HCQ for 3 years or more exhibited significant protective effects against developing new-onset DM.
15157,1598,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features and treatment in patients of marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)with monoclonal immunoglobulin (McIg).
15158,1598,"METHODS: The clinical data of MZL patients with McIg, including 3 cases diagnosed and treated in Beijing Anzhen Hospital from Jan 2007 to Dec 2014 were retrospectively studied, meanwhile 36 patients searched from literatures were reviewed."
15159,1598,"RESULTS: Of a total of 39 patients, the ratio of male and female was 1.051 with an average age of 65.1 12.3 years old."
15160,1598,"28 cases (71.8%)were with mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas (MALTL), 9 cases (23.1% )with nodal marginal zone lymphoma, and 2 cases (5.1%)with splenic marginal zone lymphoma."
15161,1598,"Nine cases (23.1% )were in the early stage, 30 cases (76.9%)in the advanced stage."
15162,1598,"The common initial symptom was non-mass lesions (65.5%), such as skin purpura, peripheral neuropathy; 13 patients (33.3% )were accompanied by autoimmune phenomenon, and most were with Sjogren's syndrome."
15163,1598,"Among MALTL patients, the common primary lesion was in non- gastrointestinal tract (17 cases, 60.7%)."
15164,1598,"Most of patients with McIg were one with McIgM (82.0%); the others with McIgA, Mc-light chain, McIgG and double McIg."
15165,1598,"The level of plasma McIgM was (25.5521.31)g/L, which was higher in advanced stage patients than in early stage ones [(29.8520.60)g/Lvs (3.232.95)g/L,P= 0.008]."
15166,1598,"The complete remission (CR)rate was 56.0% and the overall response rate (ORR)92.0%, respectively in 30 patients treated by chemotherapy."
15167,1598,"At a median follow- up of 10 months, the 3- year progression free survival and the 3-year overall survival were 44.7% and 76.5%, respectively."
15168,1598,"The rates of ORR and CR in the patients received rituximab- included regimen were seemly better than those without rituximab one (100.0%vs 78.6%, 63.6%vs 50.0%;P>0.05), but no statistic differences were found."
15169,1598,The CR rate in patients with McIgM was significantly higher than that with non- McIgM (P=0.026).
15170,1598,The plasma McIgM level decreased after chemotherapy (P=0.002).
15171,1598,"CONCLUSION: The MZL with McIg, perhaps a kind of unique subtype, usually occurred in 60 years or older patients."
15172,1598,It was often diagnosed in patients of advanced stage and susceptible to autoimmune phenomenon.
15173,1598,MALTL in non- gastrointestinal tract was more prone to find McIg.
15174,1598,"In MZL patients with McIg, McIgM was more common and other McIg rare."
15175,1598,Rituximab-included regimen produced a better therapeutic response.
15176,1599,A 38-year-old woman with relapsing longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis and Sjogren's syndrome (SS) was admitted with lower extremity muscle weakness.
15177,1599,Studies showed high serum titer of anti-aquaporin4 antibody and gadolinium-enhanced-MRI T1-weighted lesions within thoracic cord.
15178,1599,Clinical findings suggested neuromyelitis optica-spectrum disorder (NMO-SD).
15179,1599,"High-dose corticosteroids, plasma exchange and cyclophosphamide were not effective."
15180,1599,"After starting tocilizumab, her neurological findings gradually improved."
15181,1599,This report describes the first evidence to show tocilizumab could be effective for NMO-SD with SS.
15182,1600,Patients with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) have been shown to have abnormal B cell function and increased numbers of marginal zone B cells (MZB and MZB precursors.
15183,1600,The current studies utilized the Interleukin 14 alpha transgenic mouse model (IL14aTG) for SS to investigate the roles of marginal zone B cells (MZB) of the innate immune system in the pathophysiology of the disease.
15184,1600,Eliminating MZB from IL14aTG mice by B cell specific deletion of RBP-J resulted in complete elimination of all disease manifestations of SS.
15185,1600,"Mice had normal salivary gland secretions, negative autoantibodies and normal histology of the salivary and lacrimal glands compared to IL14aTG mice at the same time points."
15186,1600,"In contrast, eliminating B1 cells by deleting btk did not ameliorate the disease."
15187,1600,"Therefore, MZB are critical for the development of SS."
15188,1601,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate in primary Sjgren's syndrome, the differences between patients with and without widespread pain (WSP) with respect to the cumulative prevalence of extra-glandular manifestations (EGMs) and systemic auto-antibodies."
15189,1601,"METHODS: All outpatients diagnosed with primary Sjgren's syndrome (2) were included in a prospective follow-up, with at least one check up each year, from June 1991 until November 2011."
15190,1601,Patients who also fulfilled criteria for concomitant connective tissue disorders were excluded.
15191,1601,Widespread pain was defined as the presence of long-lasting (>one year) diffuse pain in all four body quadrants.
15192,1601,"Data were collected with respect to the cumulative prevalence of systemic auto-antibodies (anti-nuclear antibodies [ANA], anti-Sjgren syndrome A antigen [anti-SSA], anti-Sjgren syndrome B antigen [anti-SSB] and immunoglobulin M-Rheumatoid factor [IgM-RF]) and EGMs related to primary Sjgren's syndrome."
15193,1601,RESULTS: Eighty-three patients were included in the final analysis.
15194,1601,Thirty-nine (34.9%) patients had widespread pain.
15195,1601,Anti-SSB was found less frequently (p<0.05) in patients with WSP than in patients without WSP.
15196,1601,The WSP-positive patients were more frequently negative for all four tested autoantibodies (p<0.05).
15197,1601,"The patients with WSP had fewer EGMs than the patients without WSP (p<0.01); more specifically, polyneuropathy occurred less frequently (p<0.05) in the patients with WSP."
15198,1601,"Cytopenia, uveitis, pericarditis, pleuritis, interstitial lung disease, vasculitis, monoclonal gammapathy of unknown significance and non-Hodgkin lymphoma only occurred in the patients without WSP."
15199,1601,"CONCLUSIONS: Primary Sjgren's patients with WSP form a benign subgroup, with a lower prevalence of anti-SSB and EGMs (in particular polyneuropathy)."
15200,1601,We suggest a shorter period of follow-up for this subset than for the WSP-negative patients.
15201,1602,"BACKGROUND: Sjgren syndrome is a common, chronic autoimmune disease that typically produces inflammation and poor function of the salivary and lacrimal glands."
15202,1602,"Other organs can be affected, including the nervous system."
15203,1602,Sensory peripheral neuropathy is a common manifestation of the disease.
15204,1602,METHODS: Eight-eight patients attending a dry eyes-dry mouth clinic were diagnosed to have primary Sjgren syndrome and underwent a neurological examination.
15205,1602,Anti-Ro (or SSA) and anti-La (or SSB) were determined using immunodiffusion as well as Inno-Lia and BioPlex ANA screen.
15206,1602,Serum vitamin B(12) levels were determined using an enzyme-linked microtiter plate assay.
15207,1602,"RESULTS: Twenty-seven (31%) of the 88 patients had peripheral neuropathy as defined by loss of light touch, proprioception, or vibratory sensation."
15208,1602,"Anti-Ro and anti-La were found by immunodiffusion in 12 patients, and 8 of these 12 had neuropathy ((2) = 8.46, P = 0.0036, odds ratio = 6.0 compared to those without precipitating anti-Ro and anti-La)."
15209,1602,"Of the 27 patients with only anti-Ro by immunodiffusion, 13 (48.1%) had neuropathy ((2) = 5.587, P = 0.018, compared to those without anti-Ro)."
15210,1602,"There was no relationship of the other, more sensitive measures of anti-Ro and anti-La to neuropathy."
15211,1602,"In addition, we found no association of serum vitamin B(12) levels to neuropathy among these patients with Sjgren syndrome."
15212,1602,CONCLUSIONS: Sensory peripheral neuropathy is common among patients with Sjgren syndrome and is associated with the presence of anti-Ro and anti-La when determined by immunodiffusion.
15213,1603,PURPOSE: To explore the correlation between intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) magnetic resonance (MR) parameters and MR nodular grade of parotid glands in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
15214,1603,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 31 consecutive patients with SS and 28 gender- and age-matched healthy volunteers underwent bilateral parotid 3.0T MR examination including the IVIM sequence (9 b values, 0-800s/mm(2))."
15215,1603,"The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), diffusion coefficient D, pseudo-diffusion coefficient D(*), and perfusion fraction f of bilateral parotid glands were obtained, and the nodular grade of each parotid gland was evaluated according to the MR morphological appearance."
15216,1603,"RESULTS: Sixty-two parotid glands in 31 patients with SS consisted of 32, 14, 8, and 8 parotid glands at MR nodular grades 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively."
15217,1603,"In parotid glands of grade 0, 1, 2, 3 and healthy volunteers, the ADC values were (1.130.25, 1.110.17, 1.050.24, 0.890.04 and 1.000.21)10(-3)mm(2)/s, D values were (0.920.13, 0.900.19, 0.900.03, 0.670.03, 0.810.03)10(-3)mm(2)/s, f values were 0.200.04, 0.180.02, 0.150.01, 0.110.01, 0.150.06, and D(*)values were (53.8928.26, 41.7816.35, 51.2418.69, 31.8318.03, 36.8316.14)10(-3)mm(2)/s respectively."
15218,1603,"The ADC, D, f, and D(*) values of parotid glands in patients with SS at grade 0 were significantly higher than those in healthy volunteers (all P<0.05)."
15219,1603,"Significant differences were observed in the D and f values of parotid glands in patients with SS among different grades (P=0.003,<0.001, respectively)."
15220,1603,"The IVIM parameters (D, f) of parotid glands at early (grades 0-1) and advanced (grades 2-3) stages in patients with SS were significantly higher and lower, respectively, than those in healthy volunteers (all P<0.05)."
15221,1603,"The D and f values inversely correlated with MR nodular grades significantly (r=- 0.297, P=0.019; r=- 0.653, P<0.001, respectively) CONCLUSION: The parotid glands with different MR nodular grades in patients with SS showed different IVIM parameters, reflecting different pathophysiological characteristics of parotid glands at different stages."
15222,1604,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease in which the underlying cause has yet to be elucidated.
15223,1604,The main objective of this study was to determine the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of individual infiltrating T helper (Th)-1 and 17 cells of pSS patients using single-cell analysis.
15224,1604,Single-cell analysis of ex-vivo infiltrating T cells demonstrated that pSS patients had higher frequencies of activated Th17 cells.
15225,1604,Single-cell TCR sequencing revealed that TCR variable (TRBV)3-1/joint (J)1-2 (CLFLSMSACVW) and TRBV20-1/J1-1 (SVGSTAIPP*T) were expressed by activated Th1 and Th17 cells in both cohorts.
15226,1604,"Uniquely, TCR variable (TRAV)8-2/J5 (VVSDTVLETAGE) was expressed by Th1 cells present only in patients and complementarity-determining region (CDR)3-specific motif (LSTD*E) present in both Th1/Th17 cells."
15227,1604,"The study demonstrates that both activated Th1 and Th17 cells of pSS patients showed restricted clonal diversities of which two CDR3 motifs were present in controls and patients, with another two motifs unique to pSS."
15228,1605,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Migraine and systemic autoimmune diseases are 2-3-fold more common in women and various studies have reported an association between the two pathologies.
15229,1605,"METHODS: This review takes into account epidemiological studies involving migraine and systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, and other diffuse connective tissue diseases."
15230,1605,This scientific literature analysis consists of the main articles found in Medline with a search up to April 2017.
15231,1605,RESULTS: Many epidemiological studies were carried out on patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus.
15232,1605,"Results showed that headache and migraine are more prevalent in systemic lupus erythematosus patients compared to controls, especially migraine with aura."
15233,1605,Patients with Lupus and migraine show a higher lupus activity and association with Raynaud and/or antiphospholipids in these populations are contradictory.
15234,1605,There are not enough data to establish an association between antiphospholipid syndrome and migraine.
15235,1605,"However, data are more consistent between antiphospholipid carrier condition and migraine."
15236,1605,"Systemic sclerosis is a rare disease, for this reason the amount of available data on this disorder are scanty."
15237,1605,"However, some studies reported an association between headache, migraine and systemic sclerosis, especially where gliotic brain lesions and Raynaud are coexisting."
15238,1605,"Finally, large propensity cohort population based studies suggested that systemic autoimmune diseases are more frequent in patients suffering from migraine."
15239,1605,CONCLUSION: An attempt at explaining the possible link between these disorders and migraine is discussed at the end of the review.
15240,1605,Several autoimmune alterations are shared by most autoimmune diseases and headache types.
15241,1605,Endothelial dysfunction is the only alteration that is common among all these disorders.
15242,1606,PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sjgren's syndrome affects exocrine glands leading to a dry mouth and dry eyes.
15243,1606,Dry eye manifestations can precede the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome by many years.
15244,1606,Innumerous spontaneous and inducible Sjgren's syndrome models have been used to study the pathogenesis of Sjgren's syndrome.
15245,1606,"This review focuses on recent human data, ocular and extraglandular manifestations of animal models, what is known, what is still unknown and how we need to look, and their correlation correspondence to human disease."
15246,1606,"RECENT FINDINGS: Hallmarks of dry eye in Sjgren's syndrome include increased corneal staining, goblet cell loss and low tear volume."
15247,1606,Confocal microscopy and impression cytology are able to clarify new markers of the ocular disease.
15248,1606,Extraglandular manifestations should be an alert more severe complications in the eye.
15249,1606,"Some models have strong sex and exocrine gland predilection, whereas aging generally worsens the disease phenotype."
15250,1606,"Although most models do not display a significant increase in corneal staining or tear secretion impairment, conjunctival infiltration and decrease in goblet cells are frequently seen."
15251,1606,"SUMMARY: We have seen great advances in the role of inflammation in ocular, oral and extra-glandular manifestations of Sjgren's syndrome."
15252,1606,Several mechanisms and mediators of Sjgren's syndrome have been elucidated in animal model studies.
15253,1607,OBJECTIVE: To determine an appropriate focus score cutoff for childhood Sjgren syndrome (SS).
15254,1607,METHODS: Labial salivary gland tissue from specimens from children with SS and age-matched controls was retrospectively identified and reviewed by a blinded oral pathologist.
15255,1607,RESULTS: The presence of any focal sialadenitis (focus score > 0 foci/4 mm(2)) was common among childhood SS samples but present in only 1 of 8 control samples.
15256,1607,CONCLUSION: The presence of any focal lymphocytic sialadenitis in minor labial salivary gland tissue is suggestive of childhood SS and should be included in future childhood SS-specific diagnostic or classification criteria.
15257,1608,"INTRODUCTION: Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a new disease entity characterized by high serum IgG4 levels, IgG4-positive plasmacytic infiltration, and fibrosis in various organs."
15258,1608,The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of upregulation of IgG4 class switch recombination in IgG4-RD.
15259,1608,"METHODS: We extracted RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with IgG4-RD (n = 6), Sjgren syndrome (SS) (n = 6), and healthy controls (n = 8), from CD3-positive T cells and CD20-positive B cells sorted from PBMCs of patients with IgG4-RD (n = 3), SS (n = 4), and healthy controls (n = 4), as well as from labial salivary glands (LSGs) of patients with IgG4-RD (n = 11), SS (n = 13), and healthy controls (n = 3)."
15260,1608,"The mRNA expression levels of IgG4-specific class switch-related molecules, such as Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13), Treg cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-), and transcriptional factors (GATA3 and Foxp3) were examined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)."
15261,1608,"IgG4-nonspecific class switch-related molecules, such as CD40, CD154, BAFF, APRIL, IRF4, and AID, were also examined."
15262,1608,"RESULTS: The expression levels of Treg cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-) and AID were significantly higher in LSGs of IgG4-RD than in SS and the controls (P < 0.05, each)."
15263,1608,"In contrast, those of CD40 and CD154 were significantly lower in PBMCs of IgG4-RD than in SS (P < 0.05, each), whereas CD40 in CD20-positive B cells and CD154 in CD3-positive T cells were comparable in the three groups."
15264,1608,"CONCLUSION: Overexpression of IL-10, TGF-, and AID in LSGs might play important roles in the pathogenesis of IgG4-RD, such as IgG4-specific class-switch recombination and fibrosis."
15265,1608,IgG4 class-switch recombination seems to be mainly upregulated in affected organs.
15266,1609,The aim of this work was to clarify the effect of leflunomide (LEF) on the eye dryness in patients with secondary Sjgren's syndrome associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA-sSS) and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
15267,1609,"Seventy-five female patients, 45 with RA-sSS (group A) and 30 with RA (group B), taking methotrexate at a dose of 20mg/week for more than 6months were enrolled in this study."
15268,1609,They all had a loading dose of leflunomide then were maintained at a dose of 20mg/day in addition to methotrexate for another 3months.
15269,1609,The modified disease activity score (DAS28) was calculated and modified Schirmer's-I test was performed.
15270,1609,Assessment of disease parameters was done to all patients before and after 3months of taking LEF.
15271,1609,"The mean modified Schirmer's-I test showed a significant decrease after 3months of taking LEF in group A (31.6 before versus 1.91.6 after 3months, P<0.001), while this difference was non-significant in group B (21.310 versus 19.911)."
15272,1609,One patient (group A) developed peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) with exacerbation of disease activity (DAS-28=6.9) that improved by taking corticosteroids.
15273,1609,Three patients (group A) had aggravation of punctate keratocojunctivitis sicca with punctate erosions without PUK.
15274,1609,The condition improved dramatically by stopping LEF and using topical lubricants.
15275,1609,We report in this study a significant deterioration of the eye dryness in patients with sSS-RA after 3months of receiving LEF inspite of the significant improvement of their DAS28.
15276,1609,This finding was not clearly detected in RA patients.
15277,1609,"Close monitoring of eye dryness changes by special tests in patients using LEF is recommended, especially in cases with sSS-RA having very low baseline values."
15278,1610,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to clarify the effectiveness of various imaging modalities and characteristic imaging features in the screening of IgG4-related dacryoadenitis and sialadenitis (IgG4-DS), and to show the differences in the imaging features between IgG4-DS and Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
15279,1610,"METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with IgG4-DS, 51 with SS and 36 with normal salivary glands were enrolled."
15280,1610,"Images of the parotid and submandibular glands obtained using sonography, 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were retrospectively analyzed."
15281,1610,Six oral and maxillofacial radiologists randomly reviewed the arranged image sets under blinded conditions.
15282,1610,Each observer scored the confidence rating regarding the presence of the characteristic imaging findings using a 5-grade rating system.
15283,1610,"After scoring various findings, diagnosis was made as normal, IgG4-DS or SS, considering all findings for each case."
15284,1610,"RESULTS: On sonography, multiple hypoechoic areas and hyperechoic lines and/or spots in the parotid glands and obscuration of submandibular gland configuration were detected mainly in patients with SS (median scores 4, 4 and 3, respectively)."
15285,1610,Reticular and nodal patterns were observed primarily in patients with IgG4-DS (median score 5).
15286,1610,"FDG-PET/CT revealed a tendency for abnormal (18)F-FDG accumulation and swelling of both the parotid and submandibular glands in patients with IgG4-DS, particularly in the submandibular glands."
15287,1610,"On MRI, SS had a high score regarding the findings of a salt-and-pepper appearance and/or multiple cystic areas in the parotid glands (median score 4.5)."
15288,1610,"Sonography showed the highest values among the four imaging modalities for sensitivity, specificity and accuracy."
15289,1610,There were significant differences between sonography and CT (p = 0.0001) and between sonography and FDG-PET/CT (p = 0.0058) concerning accuracy.
15290,1610,CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the submandibular glands affected by IgG4-DS could be easily detected using sonography (characteristic bilateral nodal/reticular change) and FDG-PET/CT (abnormal (18)F-FDG accumulation).
15291,1610,Even inexperienced observers could detect these findings.
15292,1610,"In addition, sonography could also differentiate SS."
15293,1610,"Consequently, we recommend sonography as a modality for the screening of IgG4-DS, because it is easy to use, involves no radiation exposure and is an effective imaging modality."
15294,1611,Vitiligo is associated with other autoimmune diseases.
15295,1611,We report a 52-year-old male with a Sjgren syndrome that was treated with monthly pulses of intravenous immunoglobulin for a chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.
15296,1611,The neurological disorder responded adequately to the treatment and the patient also noted a marked remission of his vitiligo with almost compete re-pigmentation of the scalp and face and partial repigmentation of other areas.
15297,1612,"To determine the incidence and risk of Parkinson disease (PD) in patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS) according to a nationwide population-based database.In total, 12,640 patients in the SS cohort and 50,560 in the non-SS cohort were enrolled from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database from 2000 to 2010."
15298,1612,"We used the Cox multivariable proportional hazards model to determine the risk factors for PD in the SS cohort.We observed an increased incidence of PD in patients with SS, with a crude hazard ratio (HR) of 1.40 and an adjusted HR (aHR) of 1.23."
15299,1612,The cumulative incidence of PD was 1.95% higher in the SS cohort than in the non-SS cohort.
15300,1612,"The SS cohort had an elevated HR under medication use, namely cevimeline and pilocarpine (crude HR, 1.28), hydroxychloroquine (crude HR, 1.43; aHR, 1.46), and methylprednisolone (crude HR, 2.21; aHR, 1.49)."
15301,1612,"Patients receiving other non-hydroxychloroquine immunosuppressant therapies had a lower risk (aHR, 0.86) of PD."
15302,1612,"Furthermore, patients with SS aged 20 to 49 years had a 1.93-fold higher risk of PD than did those without SS (aHR, 1.93)."
15303,1612,"The risk of PD was higher (aHR, 2.20) in patients with SS without comorbidities than in those with comorbidities."
15304,1612,"The aHR of PD significantly increased when the follow-up period exceeded 9 years (aHR, 1.93).We determined an increased risk of PD in patients with SS."
15305,1612,Further investigation is warranted to determine the possible underlying mechanisms and the potential role of non-hydroxychloroquine immunosuppressants in ameliorating PD.
15306,1613,The ability to probe the protein content of human tear fluid has enormous potential for deepening our understanding of ocular and systemic disease pathology and enabling novel noninvasive tear-based diagnostic technologies.
15307,1613,"To overcome current challenges in tear proteomic measurements, we report on the first microfluidic homogeneous immunoassay capable of making rapid, quantitative, and specific measurements of endogenous tear protein biomarkers in human tear fluid."
15308,1613,"Lactoferrin (Lf) is a tear-specific biomarker for Sjgren's syndrome (SS), a serious systemic autoimmune disease currently diagnosed through rudimentary volumetric and surface chemistry measurements and an invasive lip biopsy."
15309,1613,We detail optimization of a homogeneous electrophoretic immunoassay for Lf in <1 L of tear fluid at clinically relevant concentrations.
15310,1613,"In particular, we present assay development details and a final assay that enables quantification of Lf in <5 s in a clinically relevant range for SS diagnostics."
15311,1613,"Characterization suggests the on-chip assay is accurate to within 15% of ELISA, specific (<15% nonspecific signal), and with a lower limit of detection of 3  2 nM Lf in human tear matrix."
15312,1613,"Additionally, we develop and characterize a protocol for eluting proteins from nitrocellulose Schirmer strips, the clinical de facto standard for tear collection and storage."
15313,1613,We relate on-chip measured Lf concentrations back to ocular surface concentrations for the first time to our knowledge.
15314,1613,"Taken in sum, this work details important steps toward (1) expanding the set of proteins quantified by electrophoretic immunoassays to encompass a wider range of isoelectric points than has been reported, (2) creating a first-in-kind translatable assay with clinical relevance to SS diagnostics, and (3) expanding the analytical toolkit available for rapid tear protein measurements, as is relevant to the advancement of basic research and clinical medicine."
15315,1614,BACKGROUND: Chronic sialadenitis is a relatively common disorder that is frequently referred to head and neck surgeons for diagnosis and management.
15316,1614,The management of the disorder is rapidly evolving with the introduction of salivary endoscopy.
15317,1614,The purpose of the present study was a review of the indications and techniques of endoscopic-assisted management of chronic sialadenitis at a single U.S. institution.
15318,1614,METHODS: This study is a retrospective case series of patients undergoing salivary endoscopy for chronic sialadenitis.
15319,1614,"Patient clinical information was reviewed to determine endoscopic findings, associated procedures, complications, rate of gland preservation, and early symptom control."
15320,1614,RESULTS: A total of 51 patients underwent endoscopic-assisted salivary surgery over a 24-month period.
15321,1614,"Treatment indications included sialadenitis of unclear etiology (49%), sialadenitis with sialolithiasis (47%), and Sjgren syndrome (4%)."
15322,1614,Findings included obstructive stricture formation in 22 patients (43%).
15323,1614,"Associated procedures included sialodochoplasty (41%), steroid infusion (39%), and ductal stenting (8%)."
15324,1614,Gland preservation was achieved in 40 patients (78%).
15325,1614,"Of those who were treated with endoscopic-assisted techniques alone, 38 patients (84%) had symptomatic improvement whereas 7 patients (16%) did not improve."
15326,1614,Minor complications were observed in 12% of the patients.
15327,1614,CONCLUSION: Endoscopic-assisted management of chronic sialadenitis is both safe and effective and allows gland preservation with symptom control in the majority of patients.
15328,1615,"Pityriasis versicolor is one of the most frequent epidermal mycotic infections in the world, but its atrophic variant is rarely described."
15329,1615,"The aetiology of the atrophy is still unknown, and two main hypotheses have been formulated, one suggesting a correlation with long-term use of topical steroids and the other a delayed type hypersensitivity to epicutaneous antigens derived from components of the fungus."
15330,1615,"Atrophic pityriasis versicolor is a benign disease, but needs to be distinguished from other more severe skin diseases manifesting with cutaneous atrophy."
15331,1615,"The diagnosis can be easily confirmed by direct microscopic observation of the scales soaked in 15% potassium hydroxide, which reveals the typical 'spaghetti and meatball' appearance, or by a skin biopsy in doubtful cases."
15332,1615,"Here, we describe a case of extensive atrophic pityriasis versicolor occurring in a woman affected by Sjgren's syndrome which completely resolved after topical antifungal treatment."
15333,1616,PURPOSE: This study evaluates the efficacy of 3% diquafosol tetrasodium ophthalmic solution in Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and non-SS dry eye patients unresponsive to conventional artificial tear.
15334,1616,METHODS: This retrospective study included 38 dry eye patients (11 with SS and 27 with non-SS) who were treated with 3% diquafosol due to lack of response to artificial tear treatment for more than 3 months.
15335,1616,"Signs such as tear film break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer-I test, and total ocular staining score (OSS), which consisted of corneal OSS and conjunctival OSS, were evaluated at baseline and the first visit after treatment."
15336,1616,Symptoms were quantified using visual analog scale (VAS) and ocular surface disease index (OSDI) scores.
15337,1616,Changes of parameters after treatment in all the patients and differences of changes in SS and non-SS were evaluated.
15338,1616,"RESULTS: In total population, total OSS and corneal OSS improved average 6 weeks after diquafosol treatment (all P<0.05, paired t-test), although conjunctival OSS had no improvement."
15339,1616,"TBUT increased after treatment (P=0.036), while Schirmer-I test, OSDI, and VAS showed no improvement."
15340,1616,"With respect to comparisons, total and corneal OSS improved in non-SS patients and TBUT improved in SS patients (all P<0.05)."
15341,1616,"CONCLUSIONS: Three percent diquafosol tetrasodium treatment could be considered as an additive or substitute treatment when artificial tear treatment is insufficient, as it improved OSS and TBUT."
15342,1616,"This study also demonstrated that diquafosol treatment is beneficial for TBUT improvement in SS, while it is beneficial for OSS improvement in non-SS dry eye patients."
15343,1617,OBJECTIVES: Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a common yeast used in the food industry.
15344,1617,IgG and IgA antibodies against the phosphopeptidomannan of the S. cerevisiae cell wall (ASCA) are a well known marker of disease severity in Crohn's disease.
15345,1617,"Moreover, a number of studies assessed ASCA in several systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases postulating molecular mimicry as a possible link between ASCA and autoimmunity."
15346,1617,"However, since they have never been tested in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), the purpose of this study was to investigate these antibodies in a large cohort of pSS patients, compared to healthy donors (HD), and their significance as potentially helpful biomarker in a clinical setting."
15347,1617,"METHODS: ASCA IgG+IgA were assessed with ASCA screen dot for Blue Diver instrument (Alphadia sa/nv, Belgium)."
15348,1617,"The comparison between the aminoacid sequence of mannan of S. cerevisiae and well characterised auto-antigens peculiar to pSS (52kD and 60kD Ro/SSA, La/SSB) was performed with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)."
15349,1617,RESULTS: The prevalence of ASCA in our pSS cohort was 4.8%.
15350,1617,We also reported that the ASCA target protein has a high similarity with Ro60/SSA protein further supporting the molecular mimicry hypothesis.
15351,1617,"Finally, we observed that ASCA positivity is associated with pSS specific clinical and serological features."
15352,1617,"ASCA+ pSS patients displayed a triple combination of circulating anti-Ro52/SSA, anti-Ro60/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies, associated with low complement and cutaneous involvement."
15353,1617,CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a possible pathogenic/prognostic significance of ASCA in pSS.
15354,1618,PURPOSE: To report the ocular complications of primary Sjgren syndrome (SS) in men.
15355,1618,DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
15356,1618,METHODS: setting: Tertiary-care SS center.
15357,1618,PATIENT POPULATION: Total of 163 consecutive primary Sjgren syndrome patients evaluated between January 2007 and March 2013.
15358,1618,MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Frequency of extraglandular ocular and systemic manifestations and serologic results in men compared to women.
15359,1618,RESULTS: Fourteen of the 163 primary SS patients (9%) were men.
15360,1618,"On initial presentation, men were a decade older (61 vs 50 years, P < .01) and less likely than women to have a prior diagnosis of SS (43% vs 65%, P= .09)."
15361,1618,"A majority of men reported dry eye on presentation (92%), albeit less chronic compared to women (5.9 vs 10.8 years, P= .07)."
15362,1618,"Men were more likely to present with serious ocular complications than women (43% vs 11%, P= .001)."
15363,1618,"Extraglandular systemic complications of SS (ie, vasculitis, interstitial nephritis) were also more common in men (64% vs 40%, P= .07)."
15364,1618,"Further, men were more likely to be negative for anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La, and antinuclear antibodies than women (36% men vs 11% women, P=.01)."
15365,1618,CONCLUSION: Men with primary SS have a higher frequency of serious ocular and systemic manifestations.
15366,1618,"Although primary Sjgren syndrome is typically considered a disease of middle-aged women, it may be underdiagnosed and consequentially more severe in men."
15367,1618,Physicians should have a lower threshold to test for SS in men with dry eye.
15368,1619,PURPOSE: Recent literature suggests that sialendoscopy of the major salivary glands could alleviate symptoms of Sjgren syndrome (SS) and restore salivary function.
15369,1619,The aim of this study was to evaluate the authors' experience of sialendoscopy of the salivary glands in patients with SS.
15370,1619,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective case series study, the surgical data of patients with SS who had undergone sialendoscopy at the VU University Medical Center (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) from November 2014 through April 2015 were used."
15371,1619,Outcome measurements were successful entry to the salivary gland and completion of sialendoscopy as planned.
15372,1619,"Furthermore, pre- and postoperative complications were scored."
15373,1619,Descriptive analysis of the data was performed.
15374,1619,"RESULTS: Surgical data of sialoendoscopic procedures in 26 patients with SS (24 women and 2 men; mean age, 57yr; range, 27 to 72yr) were analyzed."
15375,1619,Sialendoscopy was successfully performed in 78 of 104 salivary glands (75%; 50 parotid and 28 submandibular glands) in the 26 patients.
15376,1619,Sialendoscopy failed in 26 of the 104 sialoendoscopic procedures (25%; 2 parotid and 24 submandibular glands).
15377,1619,"In 16 salivary glands, the ductal orifice could not be identified."
15378,1619,"In 7 salivary glands, sialendoscopy could not be performed because of partial or complete stenosis of the salivary duct."
15379,1619,"In 3 salivary glands, sialendoscopy was not performed because of a ductal perforation."
15380,1619,Three patients developed a postoperative infection.
15381,1619,CONCLUSION: The overall rate of complications was limited and the sialoendoscopic complications in patients with SS could be regarded as minor.
15382,1619,Most complications were seen for sialendoscopy of the submandibular glands in this specific patient category.
15383,1619,Careful preoperative selection of patients and salivary glands could contribute to a lower rate of complications and more predictable results.
15384,1620,BACKGROUND: A number of reports have indicated an association between thyroid diseases and primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
15385,1620,"However, fewer studies have investigated whether the presence of thyroid diseases is associated with increased risk of developing pSS."
15386,1620,"Thus, the aim of our study was to use a nationwide health claims database to explore the prevalence and risk of pSS in female patients with thyroid diseases."
15387,1620,"METHODS: From the Registry of Catastrophic Illness database in the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan, we identified 389 female patients with a diagnosis of pSS from 2005 to 2010."
15388,1620,"We also obtained 1945 control subjects frequency-matched on sex, 10-year age interval, and year of index date from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID2000)."
15389,1620,Both groups were retrospectively traced back to a period of eight years to obtain diagnosis of thyroid diseases prior to index date.
15390,1620,"RESULTS: A significantly higher risk of pSS was associated with the presence of thyroid diseases (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.6-2.9)."
15391,1620,"Among the sub-categories of thyroid diseases, patients with thyroiditis (AOR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.7-7.5), thyrotoxicosis (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.6-3.8), and unspecified hypothyroidism (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.2-4.6), and simple and unspecified goiter (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.3-3.3) were significantly associated with increased risk of pSS."
15392,1620,"The associations were generally stronger in the mid-forties to mid-sixties age group, except in patients with unspecified hypothyroidism."
15393,1620,"CONCLUSIONS: The risk of pSS was significantly increased in female patients with thyroid diseases, particularly those in their mid-forties to mid-sixties."
15394,1620,An increased awareness of the possibility of pSS in perimenopausal females with thyroid diseases is important to preserve their quality of life and to avoid comorbidity.
15395,1621,"OBJECTIVE: The central nervous system (CNS) may be involved in a variety of inflammatory diseases of the blood vessels, generally known as vasculitis."
15396,1621,"The clinical diagnosis of such involvement in early stages is difficult, since a mild cognitive impairment can be the only symptom."
15397,1621,It was hypothesized that brain-perfusion SPECT would be able to reveal CNS involvement and to monitor the course of the disease.
15398,1621,The purpose of this study was assess if and when an improvement of cerebral perfusion can be registered by SPECT during the follow-up of these diseases.
15399,1621,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighteen patients affected by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 22 by undifferentiated vasculitis (UV), 5 by Behcet's disease (BD) and 5 by primary Sjogren's Syndrome (pSS) were enrolled in this prospective study."
15400,1621,A (99m)Tc-HMPAO brain perfusion SPECT was performed before the treatment and was repeated during the follow-up at different time intervals.
15401,1621,Image analysis was performed on 10 cerebral areas using a specific software.
15402,1621,"RESULTS: In the SLE patients, no significant improvement of brain perfusion was found."
15403,1621,"On the contrary, in the UV the cerebral uptake of the tracer significantly improved from the twenty-fourth month (18/22 patients)."
15404,1621,"Patients with BD showed an improvement of scintigraphic findings (5/5 patients), while a similar result was obtained only in 2 of the patients with pSS."
15405,1621,"CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, brain SPECT seems to be able to monitor the disease in UV, indicating the moment when an improvement of the cerebral perfusion is achieved."
15406,1621,In SLE patients this scintigraphic technique did not show a significant improvement in CNS perfusion.
15407,1622,"BACKGROUND: Cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis (CV) is often related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but it can develop in other diseases (e.g."
15408,1622,"other infections, connective tissue diseases, malignancies) in the absence of HCV infection."
15409,1622,A comparison of the performance of the recently published classification criteria for the CV was made between HCV-positive and HCV negative patients with serum cryoglobulins.
15410,1622,METHODS: 500 patients with serum cryoglobulins were studied.
15411,1622,"Their mean age was 60.7713.75 years, they were 356 females (71.2%) and 144 males (28.8%)."
15412,1622,"CV was diagnosed in 272 patients (54.4%), while other diseases associated with serum cryoglobulins without CV (CwV) were diagnosed in 228 patients (45.6%)."
15413,1622,"RESULTS: 117 HCV negative patients were collected (23.4%) and they were 42/272 (15.4%) among the CV group, while they were 75/228 (32.9%) among the CwV."
15414,1622,"In HCV negative patients the sensitivity and specificity of the classification criteria of CV were 89.5% CI 95% [79.5-99.5] and 90.3% CI 95% [82.8-97.8], respectively, while in HCV positive patients they were 88.3% CI 95% [83.6%-93.1%] and 96.1% CI 95% [91.8-100], respectively."
15415,1622,"The most frequent disease recognised among the HCV negative patients was Sjgren's syndrome (SS) (55/117, 47.0%), and the sensitivity and the specificity of the CV classification criteria were 88.9% CI 95% [76.5-100] and 91.3% CI 95% [79.2-100], respectively."
15416,1622,CONCLUSIONS: The classification criteria for CV showed a good performance even in HCV-unrelated patients.
15417,1622,"A slightly lower specificity was observed for the classification of HCV-unrelated CV, since some clinical manifestations included in the clinical item for the classification criteria occurred more frequently in HCV-negative rather than HCV-positive controls with CWV."
15418,1623,OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of CD40-CD154 costimulation and effects of therapeutic pathway blockade in the non-obese diabetic (NOD/ShiLtJ) model of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
15419,1623,METHODS: We assessed leucocyte infiltration in salivary glands (SGs) from NOD/ShiLtJ mice by immunohistochemistry and examined transcriptomics data of SG tissue from these animals for evidence of a CD40 pathway gene signature.
15420,1623,"Additionally, we dosed MR1 (anti-CD154 antibody) in NOD mice after the onset of SS-like disease and examined the effects of MR1 treatment on sialadenitis, autoantibody production, SG leucocyte infiltration, gene expression downstream of CD40 and acquaporin 5 (AQP5) expression."
15421,1623,RESULTS: We could detect evidence of CD40 expression and pathway activation in SG tissue from NOD mice.
15422,1623,"Additionally, therapeutic treatment with MR1 suppressed CD40 pathway genes and sialadenitis, inhibited ectopic lymphoid structure formation and autoantibody production, as well as decreased the frequency of antibody-secreting cells in SGs but had minimal effects on AQP5 expression in NOD/ShiLtJ SGs."
15423,1623,"CONCLUSION: CD40-CD154 interactions play an important role in key pathological processes in a mouse model of SS, suggesting that blockade of this costimulatory pathway in the clinic may have beneficial therapeutic effects in patients suffering from this autoimmune exocrinopathy."
15424,1624,"OBJECTIVE: To better understand the role of B cells, the potential mechanisms responsible for their aberrant activation, and the production of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS), this study explored patterns of selection pressure and sites of N-glycosylation acquired by somatic mutation (acN-glyc) in the IgG variable (V) regions of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) isolated from the minor salivary glands of patients with SS and non-SS control patients with sicca symptoms."
15425,1624,METHODS: A novel method to produce and characterize recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAb) from single cell-sorted ASC infiltrates was applied to concurrently probe expressed genes (all heavy- and light-chain isotypes as well as any other gene of interest not related to immunoglobulin) in the labial salivary glands of patients with SS and non-SS controls.
15426,1624,"V regions were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, sequenced, and analyzed for the incidence of N-glycosylation and selection pressure."
15427,1624,"For specificity testing, the amplified regions were expressed as either the native mAb or mutant mAb lacking the acN-glyc motif."
15428,1624,"Protein modeling was used to demonstrate how even an acN-glyc site outside of the complementarity-determining region could participate in, or inhibit, antigen binding."
15429,1624,"RESULTS: V-region sequence analyses revealed clonal expansions and evidence of secondary light-chain editing and allelic inclusion, of which neither of the latter two have previously been reported in patients with SS."
15430,1624,"Increased frequencies of acN-glyc were found in the sequences from patients with SS, and these acN-glyc regions were associated with an increased number of replacement mutations and lowered selection pressure."
15431,1624,"A clonal set of polyreactive mAb with differential framework region 1 acN-glyc motifs was also identified, and removal of the acN-glyc could nearly abolish binding to autoantigens."
15432,1624,"CONCLUSION: These findings support the notion of an alternative mechanism for the selection and proliferation of some autoreactive B cells, involving V-region N-glycosylation, in patients with SS."
15433,1625,BACKGROUND: To clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) with anti-centromere antibody (ACA).
15434,1625,METHODS: Characteristics of 14 patients of pSS with ACA were evaluated.
15435,1625,All patients were anti-SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La antibodies negative (ACA+ group) without sclerodactyly.
15436,1625,"The prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), titer of IgG and focus score (FS) in the minor salivary glands (MSGs) were determined."
15437,1625,Quantification analysis of Azan Mallory staining was performed to detect collagenous fiber.
15438,1625,Forty eight patients in whom ACA was absent were chosen as the conventional (ACA-) pSS group.
15439,1625,RESULTS: Prevalence of ACA+ SS patients was 14 out of 129 (10.85%) pSS patients.
15440,1625,RP was observed in 61.5% of the patients with ACA.
15441,1625,The level of IgG in the ACA+ group was significantly lower than that of the ACA- group (p = 0.018).
15442,1625,Statistical difference was also found in the FS of MSGs from the ACA+ group (1.4 +/- 1.0) as compared with the ACA- group (2.3 +/- 1.6) (p = 0.035).
15443,1625,"In contrast, the amount of fibrous tissue was much higher in the ACA+ group (65052.2 +/- 14520.6 microm(2) versus 26251.3 +/- 14249.8 microm(2)) (p = 1.3 x 10(-12))."
15444,1625,CONCLUSIONS: Low cellular infiltration but with an increase in fibrous tissues may explain the clinical feature of a high prevalence of RP and normal IgG concentration in ACA+ pSS.
15445,1626,Hypercalcaemia is a rare but potentially life-threatening consequence of malignancies.
15446,1626,"Solid cancers, such as lymphomas, increase serum calcium primarily through parathyroid hormone-related protein or ectopic production of 1alpha-hydroxylase."
15447,1626,We present a case of 56-year-old woman with Sjogren's syndrome and psoriasis in the setting of chronic methotrexate (MTX) use who developed worsening hypercalcaemia and symptoms suggestive of lymphoma.
15448,1626,Pathology results diagnosed her with MTX-induced iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD).
15449,1626,This case reminds clinicians that chronic MTX use is associated with LPDs and can ultimately lead to hypercalcaemia.
15450,1626,"The patient's MTX and other immunosuppressive medications were stopped, and her calcium corrected with fluids and calcitonin."
15451,1626,"At her 8-month follow-up postdischarge, the patient was asymptomatic with normal laboratory results and in partial clinical remission."
15452,1627,"INTRODUCTION: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) involves a chronic, progressive inflammation primarily of the salivary and lacrimal glands leading to decreased levels of saliva and tears resulting in dry mouth and dry eye diseases."
15453,1627,"Seminal findings regarding TH17 cell populations that secrete predominantly interleukin (IL)-17A have been shown to play an important role in an increasing number of autoimmune diseases, including SS."
15454,1627,"In the present study, we investigated the function of IL-17A on the development and onset of SS."
15455,1627,METHODS: Adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vectors expressing either IL-17A or LacZ were infused via retrograde cannulation into the salivary glands of C57BL/6J mice between 6 and 8 weeks of age or between 15 and 17 weeks of age.
15456,1627,The mice were characterized for SS phenotypes.
15457,1627,"RESULTS: Disease profiling indicated that SS-non-susceptible C57BL/6J mice whose salivary glands received the Ad5-IL17A vector developed a SS-like disease profile, including the appearance of lymphocytic foci, increased cytokine levels, changes in antinuclear antibody profiles, and temporal loss of saliva flow."
15458,1627,CONCLUSIONS: Induction of SS pathology by IL-17A in SS-non-susceptible mice strongly suggests that IL-17A is an important inflammatory cytokine in salivary gland dysfunction.
15459,1627,"Thus, localized anti-IL17 therapy may be effective in preventing glandular dysfunction."
15460,1628,"B-cell activating factor (BAFF) levels are increased in rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
15461,1628,"However, BAFF contribution to pathogenesis is not completely understood."
15462,1628,"In pSS, immune infiltration of the salivary and lacrimal glands leads to xerostomia and xerophtalmia."
15463,1628,"Glandular B cell hyperactivation, differentiation into germinal center (GC)-like structures and plasma cell accumulation are histopathological hallmarks that were attributed to increased BAFF."
15464,1628,"Here, we experimentally tested this hypothesis by overexpressing BAFF in a mouse model of pSS."
15465,1628,BAFF overexpression enhanced lymphocytic infiltration and MHCII expression on B cells.
15466,1628,Increased BAFF also induced B cell differentiation into GC B cells within the autoimmune target tissue.
15467,1628,"However, even in these conditions, GC B cells only accounted for <1% of glandular B cells, demonstrating that BAFF is not efficiently promoting ectopic GC formation in pSS and warranting further investigation of therapeutics targeting both BAFF and the related TNF-family member APRIL."
15468,1629,PURPOSE: Sjgren syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the inflammatory destruction of salivary and lacrimal glands (LG).
15469,1629,Chloroquine (CQ) was known as an immunomodulatory drug and in the inhibition of autophagy.
15470,1629,The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of CQ on the development of dry eye in NOD-LtJ mice.
15471,1629,"METHODS: NOD-LtJ mice were observed, during which the occurrence of dry eye was confirmed by tear secretion, corneal staining, and the infiltration of foci into the LG from 13-week-old mice."
15472,1629,Intraperitoneal (IP) administration of CQ was performed in 13-week-old mice for 4 weeks and maintained untreated for another 4 weeks.
15473,1629,"Additionally, CQ was injected IP in 19-week-old mice for 2 weeks from when the disease was fully developed."
15474,1629,"RESULTS: Interestingly, the expression of autophagy marker ATG5 and LC3B-II was observed in the LG from week 5."
15475,1629,"When CQ had been administered for 4 weeks from week 13 and then maintained untreated for 4 weeks, tear secretion, corneal staining score, foci formation in the LG, conjunctival goblet cells and proinflammatory cytokine expressions were significantly better than untreated mice."
15476,1629,The infiltration of immune cells and the expression of autophagy markers in LG were decreased in the CQ group.
15477,1629,These indices improved significantly as well when the 19-week-old mice with severe clinical phenotypes had been treated with CQ for 2 weeks.
15478,1629,CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that autophagy was induced in the early stages of the SS model and that CQ treatment in the early stages could inhibit disease progression.
15479,1630,OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the expression of regulatory T cells in primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS) and to evaluate the clinical role of CD4(+)Helios(+)FoxP3(+) cells in pSS patients.
15480,1630,METHODS: CD4(+)FoxP3(+)T cells in the peripheral blood of 39 pSS patients and 30 healthy controls were measured by flow cytometry and CD25 and Helios expression were also analyzed.
15481,1630,The repression ability of CD4(+)CD25(hi) cells was tested in vitro.
15482,1630,Clinical information of pSS patients was retrospectively collected and their correlations with circulating Treg cells were analyzed.
15483,1630,Cytokine levels in plasma were measured by ELISA and correlations with Helios(+)FoxP3(+)cells were also detected.
15484,1630,RESULTS: Circulating FoxP3(+)and Helios(+)FoxP3(+)cells were elevated in pSS patients compared with controls.
15485,1630,The suppression function of CD4(+)CD25(hi) cells is not different between two groups.
15486,1630,"There are inverse correlations between Helios(+)FoxP3(+)percentage and ESR, IgG, IgM and ESSDAI."
15487,1630,Anti-SSB(-) patients possess higher level of Helios(+)FoxP3(+)cells than anti-SSB(+)patients.
15488,1630,"IL-6, IFN and IFN levels were increased in pSS plasma and there were positive correlations between the levels of IFN/IFN and percentage of Helios(+)FoxP3(+)cells."
15489,1630,CONCLUSION: Circulating Helios (+)FoxP3(+) cells were elevated in pSS patients and may contribute to suppressing autoimmunity in pSS patients.
15490,1631,"BACKGROUND: At sufficiently high doses, methotrexate (HDMTX) achieves substantial CNS penetration, whereas other tissues can be rescued from the effects of HDMTX by leucovorin rescue (LR), which does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier."
15491,1631,"OBJECTIVES: To report on the efficacy and safety of HDMTX with LR (HDMTX-LR), in the treatment of acute demyelinating inflammatory CNS syndromes refractory to conventional immunotherapy."
15492,1631,"METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 12 patients treated (6 multiple sclerosis [MS], 4 neuromyelitis optica [NMO], and 2 Sjogren's syndrome myelopathy [SSM]) with HDMTX-LR after failing to improve, or exhibiting worsening following conventional immunotherapy."
15493,1631,"11 patients were followed for a total of 6months following HDMTX-LR (one was lost to follow up after 1month); and clinical findings were documented at 1month, 3months, and 6months following HDMTX-LR therapy."
15494,1631,"RESULTS: Ten patients demonstrated both clinical and radiologic evidence of near, if not complete, abolishment of disease activity, in conjunction with impressive reconstitution of neurologic function in the 6-month period following HDMTX-LR."
15495,1631,Mean Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) prior to HDMTX-LR was 8.1 (1.4).
15496,1631,"Following HDMTX-LR, mean EDSS was 6.6 (2.4) at 1month, 5.8 (2.3) at 3months, and 5.7 (2.3) at 6months."
15497,1631,"CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective assessment of treatment-recalcitrant fulminant inflammatory CNS syndromes, HDMTX-LR was observed to be a safe and highly effective treatment, producing the rapid and near complete cessation of disease activity, in conjunction with an important corresponding and 'durable remission' in the majority of our small treatment cohort."
15498,1632,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune systemic disease, characterized by a lymphoplasmocytic infiltration and a progressive destruction of salivary and lachrymal glands, leading to ocular and mouth dryness."
15499,1632,"T cells were originally considered to play the initiating role in the autoimmune process, while B cells were restricted to autoantibody production."
15500,1632,"However, recent years have seen growing evidence that the roles of B cells in pSS pathophysiology are multiple, and that these cells may actually play a central role in the development of the disease."
15501,1632,B cells are over-stimulated and produce excessive amounts of immunoglobulins and various autoantibodies.
15502,1632,"Peripheral blood and salivary-gland B-cell subset distribution is altered, leading to the constitution of ectopic germinal centers where auto-reactive clones may escape tolerance checkpoints."
15503,1632,"B cells control T-cell activation by different means: B effector cells guide Th1 or Th2 differentiation, whereas regulatory B cells inhibit T-cell proliferation."
15504,1632,"Several B-cell specific cytokines, such as BAFF or Flt-3L, are instrumental in the occurrence of B-cell dysfunction."
15505,1632,Chronic and excessive stimulation of B cells may lead to the development of lymphoma in pSS patients.
15506,1632,Autoantibodies and blood B-cell subset analysis are major contributors of a clinical diagnosis of pSS.
15507,1632,These considerations led to the development of B-cell depletion therapies for the management of pSS.
15508,1632,"Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody to CD20, is the best studied biologics in pSS, but other treatments hold promise, targeting for example CD22 or BAFF."
15509,1632,"Thus, during the last 20 years, the understanding of the multifaceted roles of B cells in pSS has revolutionized the management of this complex disease."
15510,1633,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized primarily by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands, and autoantibody production."
15511,1633,Multiple environmental factors affecting an individual with a genetic susceptibility may trigger the development of SS.
15512,1633,"Herein, we aimed to evaluate links between the different pebbles in the mosaic of SS."
15513,1633,"Demographic, clinical data and blood samples were gathered from 82 consecutive patients with SS, and 139 healthy controls."
15514,1633,Samples were analyzed for infectious serology and auto-antibodies as well as for relevant genetic mutations (TAP genes) and cytokines levels.
15515,1633,"An immune response (IgG) against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) early antigen (EA) was positively associated with SS (OR 4; 95% CI: 1.82-8.83, p=0.001) while a protective effect of IgG anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) was observed (OR 0.3; 95%CI: 0.16-0.74, p=0.009)."
15516,1633,"Anti-Ro/SSA, anti-LA/SSB, anti-nuclear, anti-gliadin, anti-TTG-IgG and anti-RNP antibodies were statistically more prevalent among SS patients than controls."
15517,1633,"Notably, the presence of anti-Ro/SSA and anti La/SSB correlated with anti-EBVEA IgG (OR 3.1; 95%CI: 1.08-8.74) and (OR 3.9; 95%CI: 1.37-10.96) respectively."
15518,1633,"Autoantibodies, cytokines and several genetic markers correlated with clinical manifestation of SS."
15519,1633,Our data suggest that infectious agents may play both a causative and protective role in the pathogenesis of SS.
15520,1633,"Moreover certain autoantibodies, cytokines and specific TAP alleles correlate with clinical manifestations of SS, and may enable better prediction and/or directed therapy once confirmed in future studies."
15521,1634,OBJECTIVES: To evaluate salivary adiponectin and adenosine deaminase (ADA) in women suffering from Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
15522,1634,METHODS: Salivary adiponectin and ADA were measured in patients with SS (n=17) and compared to their values in healthy controls (n=13) and patients suffering from drug-induced xerostomia (non-SS sicca group; n=19).
15523,1634,"A clinical history was made for each patient, patients were examined clinically, and xerostomia inventory (XI) was performed."
15524,1634,RESULTS: Salivary adiponectin corrected by total protein was higher in patients with SS than in healthy individuals (P<0.05) or patients with non-SS sicca (P<0.01) and correlated with XI (r=0.555; P<0.05).
15525,1634,Salivary ADA was higher in patients with SS and non-SS sicca compared to controls (P<0.05 in both cases).
15526,1634,CONCLUSION: The results of the present study indicate that adiponectin and ADA are increased in the saliva of patients with SS.
15527,1634,CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Salivary adiponectin corrected by total protein can be a potential biomarker of SS.
15528,1634,TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03156569.
15529,1635,BACKGROUND: The isolated finding of an unexplained chronic subdural haematoma in an infant may suggest non-accidental head injury (NAHI).
15530,1635,The authors report a previously undescribed cause of multifocal chronic subdural haematoma in infancy which could result in a misdiagnosis of previous NAHI.
15531,1635,"METHODS: Two infants, aged 3 and 4 months of age, presented with progressively increasing head circumference measurements from birth."
15532,1635,There was no history of encephalopathy.
15533,1635,Retinal haemorrhages were not present.
15534,1635,CT and MRI demonstrated bilateral subdural fluid collections over the frontal regions that were consistent with either chronic subdural haematomas or haemorrhagic subdural effusions.
15535,1635,"In view of the possibility of NAHI, child protection investigations were initiated."
15536,1635,FINDINGS: In neither case did the child protection investigations raise concerns.
15537,1635,Comprehensive investigations for known haematological and metabolic disorders associated with subdural haematomas or effusions in infants were all normal.
15538,1635,In both cases the infant's mother had a history of Sjgren's syndrome and both infants had positive anti-Ro antibody at presentation.
15539,1635,CONCLUSIONS: Transplacental acquisition of anti-Ro antibodies has been associated with external hydrocephalus.
15540,1635,External hydrocephalus has been recognised as a predisposing factor for subdural haemorrhage.
15541,1635,These are the first reported cases linking the presence of anti-Ro antibodies and external hydrocephalus with subdural fluid collections in infancy.
15542,1636,AIM: Research objective - comparative analysis of incidence and structure of anxiety-depressive spectrum disorders (ADD) in patients with various rheumatic diseases (RD).
15543,1636,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: 613 patients with RD were enrolled in the study: 180 with a reliable diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 128 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 110 with systemic sclerosis (SSc), 115 with Behcet's disease (BD), 80 with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
15544,1636,"Female prevailed in all groups (95% of patients with pSS, 88,2% - SSc, 87,2% - RA, 85,5% of SLE) except BD patients (70% male)."
15545,1636,"The mean age was 42.31.54 years and was lower in patients with BD (33.30.98 years) and SLE (34.60.93 years) compared to patients with SSc (49.92.47 years), RA (47.40.99 years) and pSS (46.22.3 years)."
15546,1636,"The mean RD duration was 130,08,65 months and was more at BD - 148,510,4 months, pSS - 141,68,92 months, RA - 138,410,1months, and less at SLE - 134,98,8 months and SSc - 87,05,04 months."
15547,1636,"The mean SLE activity index SLEDAI was 9,130,63 points (high), RA (DAS28) - 5,260,17 points (high), BD (BDCAF) - 3,790,2 points (moderate) and SSc by G. Valentini - 1,10,20 points (moderate)."
15548,1636,"Glucocorticoids took 100% of patients with pSS, 91,1% - SLE, 90% - SSc, 87% - BD and 67,2% - RA patients; conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) took 90% of patients with SSc, 84% - BD, 79,6% - RA, 68% - pSS, 40,6% - SLE."
15549,1636,"Biologic DMARDs took 32% of patients with RA, 17,4% - BD, 7,3% - SSc and 7,2% - SLE."
15550,1636,Mental disorders were diagnosed by psychiatrist as a result of screening by the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and in semi-structured interview in accordance with the ICD-10/ DSM-IV.
15551,1636,The severity of depression was evaluated by Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and anxiety - by Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A).
15552,1636,Projective psychological methods were used for cognitive impairment detection.
15553,1636,"RESULTS: Screening of depressive disorders (HADS-D8) was positive in 180 (29,4%) patients with RD, including 74 (41%) patients with SLE, 38 (35%) - SSc, 29 (23%) - RA, 23 (20%) - BD and 16 (20%) - pSS; anxiety disorders (HADS-A8) - in 272 (44,4%) patients, including 66 (52%) patients with RA, 40 (50%) - pSS, 77 (43%) - SLE, 45 (41%) - SSc and 44 (38%) - BD."
15554,1636,"In accordance with the ICD-10/ DSM-IV depressive disorders have been identified in 389 (63%) patients, including 94 (73%) patients with RA, 71 (64,5%) - SSc, 69 (60%) - BD, 90 (50%) - SLE and 39 (49%) - pSS; anxiety disorders - in 377 (61,5%) patients, including 20 (25%) patients with pSS, 44 (24,5%) - SLE, 29 (23%) - RA, 20 (17%) - BD and 7 (6,4%) - SSc."
15555,1636,"CONCLUSION: Anxiety-depressive spectrum disorders are typical for most patients with RA, SLE, SSc, pSS and BD."
15556,1636,ADDs diagnosis in RD patients with the use of the HADS did not reveal a significant proportion.
15557,1636,"To obtain objective data on the frequency and structure of ADDs, psychopathological and clinical psychological diagnosis is necessary."
15558,1637,"Simple and non-invasive saliva-based diagnostics may be useful for the identification, understanding, and monitoring of autoimmune and infectious diseases."
15559,1637,"Previously, Luciferase Immunoprecipitation Systems (LIPS) were used for sensitive detection of patient serum autoantibodies in Sjgren's Syndrome (SjS), a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the salivary and lacrimal glands."
15560,1637,Here we explored the ability of LIPS to diagnose SjS based on IgG autoantibodies in patient saliva.
15561,1637,"From LIPS testing, anti-Ro60 autoantibodies were detected in the saliva of 70% (19/27) of SjS patients with 96% specificity."
15562,1637,Positive anti-Ro60 autoantibodies were also found in 70% of the matched serum samples (96% specificity).
15563,1637,LIPS detected Ro52 autoantibodies in the saliva and serum of 67% of SjS patients with 100% specificity.
15564,1637,"Overall, the autoantibody titers in saliva were approximately 4000-fold lower by volume than serum, but still distinguished seropositive patients from controls."
15565,1637,These results suggest that LIPS salivary-based testing for SjS autoantibodies is a practical alternative to serum and compatible with point-of-care testing.
15566,1638,The pathophysiology of exocrine dysfunction observed in Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is not fully understood.
15567,1638,The purpose of this study was to investigate whether autoantibodies against human AQP5 are present in the sera of SS patients.
15568,1638,"Frozen sections of mouse submandibular salivary glands, CHO cells over-expressing a human AQP5-GFP fusion protein or GFP, and MDCK cells over-expressing AQP5 were used in the indirect immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-AQP5 autoantibodies in the sera from patients with primary SS."
15569,1638,The lysates of HEK-293 cells over-expressing the AQP5-GFP fusion protein or GFP were used for immunoprecipitation.
15570,1638,"Serum IgG from the SS patients but not from the control subjects stained acinar cells in the mouse salivary glands, the signals of which colocalized with those of AQP5-specific antibodies."
15571,1638,Serum IgG from the SS patients also selectively stained AQP5-GFP expressed in CHO cells.
15572,1638,"However, both the control and SS sera immunoprecipitated the AQP5-GFP, suggesting that autoantibodies against AQP5 were also present in the control sera."
15573,1638,The screening of 53 control and 112 SS samples by indirect immunofluorescence assay using the AQP5-expressing MDCK cells revealed the presence of significantly higher levels of anti-AQP5 IgG in the SS samples than in the control samples with sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.68.
15574,1638,"Furthermore, the presence of anti-AQP5 autoantibodies was associated with low resting salivary flow in SS patients."
15575,1638,"In conclusion, anti-AQP5 autoantibodies were detected in the sera from SS patients, which could be a novel biomarker of SS and provide new insight into the pathogenesis of SS."
15576,1639,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disorder affecting primarily the exocrine glands, leading to keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) and xerostomia, but that can also include extraglandular features(1)."
15577,1639,"Due the anatomical, physiological and pathological similarity between the pancreas and the salivary glands, it has been described that the pancreas it is not exempt from the damage produced by this syndrome."
15578,1639,"Some authors have assessed pancreatic involvement of SS by analyzing the histopathological changes, evaluating the pancreatic endocrine and exocrine function (serum pancreatic enzymes, elastase, lipase or trypsin determinations, N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-para-aminobenzoic acid excretion test, etc), searching specific pancreatic antibodies (antiductal) or performing endoscopic retrograde colangiopancreatography or noninvasive imaging studies such as computed tomography or ultrasound."
15579,1639,Herein we review the literature regarding the prevalence and type of pancreatic involvement in the SS and we discuss the differential diagnosis with multiorganic Lymphoproliferative Syndrome.
15580,1640,INTRODUCTION: Fetal AV block in SSA/Ro pregnancies is generally not seen before 18-week gestation and onset is rare after 28-week gestation.
15581,1640,"If complete AV block appears, it is believed to be irreversible."
15582,1640,The purpose of the study was to evaluate precise electrophysiological AV conduction from 18-week gestation onwards.
15583,1640,PATIENTS AND METHODS: 21 fetuses of pregnant women with collagen vascular diseases were included in the study group and 59 healthy fetuses served as controls.
15584,1640,"In addition to fetal echocardiography, fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) was used to investigate precise electrophysiological fetal cardiac time intervals (fCTIs)."
15585,1640,"RESULTS: The PR segment (isoelectric segment between the end of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex) was significantly prolonged (P < 0.036 2nd trimester, P < 0.023 3rd trimester) in both trimesters within the study group."
15586,1640,"In fetuses less than 23-week gestational age, a nearly complete separation was found, where a PR segment of 60ms or greater completely excluded control fetuses."
15587,1640,All other fCTIs did not differ significantly.
15588,1640,None of the fetuses progressed to a more advanced heart block.
15589,1640,"CONCLUSION: Slight antibody effects in pregnancy, leading to PR segment prolongation, can already be seen from 18-week gestation onwards by fMCG."
15590,1640,"Serial fetal Doppler echocardiography and additional fMCG can be useful methods to measure early and precise AV conduction time, to achieve best surveillance for these high-risk pregnancies."
15591,1641,This report describes the clinical course and multi-modality imaging findings in an anti-SSA-antibody-exposed fetus with suspected myocardial inflammation.
15592,1641,"Postnatal cardiac MRI - using fast acquisition, free-breathing with feed-and-swaddle technique - was used to evaluate for myocardial fibrosis/inflammation."
15593,1641,"This is the first published report, to our knowledge, of ductal constriction temporally associated with oral dexamethasone therapy in an anti-SSA-antibody-exposed fetus and of the use of this unique postnatal MRI protocol in this setting."
15594,1642,HYPOTHESIS: The histopathology of Sjogren's syndrome (SS) in the human inner ear correlates with mouse models of autoimmune inner ear disease.
15595,1642,BACKGROUND: SS is an autoimmune disease in which 25% of patients have sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).
15596,1642,The inner ear histology in a SS mouse model has shown degeneration of the stria vascularis (SV) and immunoglobulin G deposition on the basement membrane of SV blood vessels.
15597,1642,Correlation with human temporal bone histopathology has not been addressed.
15598,1642,METHODS: The histopathology and immunohistochemistry of the inner ear in 4 patients with SS is described and compared with SS mouse models.
15599,1642,RESULTS: The histopathology of the inner ear in 3 patients with SS and SNHL showed severe loss of the intermediate cells of the SV and immunoglobulin G deposition on the basement membrane of SV blood vessels.
15600,1642,These results parallel those of known SS mouse models.
15601,1642,"Additionally, there was shrinkage of the spiral ganglia neurons in 2 patients, whereas vestibular ganglia neurons were preserved."
15602,1642,The fourth patient with SS and normal hearing showed only mild SV atrophy.
15603,1642,CONCLUSION: This is the first study describing the pathologic changes in the inner ear of 4 patients with SS.
15604,1642,The 3 SS specimens with SNHL showed pathologic changes in the SV similar to the mouse model of autoimmune inner ear disease.
15605,1642,"Additionally, we propose that spiral ganglia neurons may be directly affected by SS pathology."
15606,1642,These results highlight the importance of correlating the histopathology of human temporal bones with animal models to better understand inner ear disease in future research.
15607,1643,MAIT cells are expanded in salivary glands of patients with Sjogren's syndrome and are IL-17 polarized.
15608,1643,"IL-7 and IL-23 induce IL-17 production activating two different pathways: IL-7 stimulation induces in fact a significant STAT3 and HIF1alpha upregulation, conversely, IL-23 stimulation significantly induces RORc overexpression in MAIT cells of patients with Sjogren's syndrome."
15609,1644,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands, mainly the lacrimal and salivary glands leading to a chronic sicca syndrome."
15610,1644,"However, extraglandular organ systems may frequently be involved, including both central and peripheral nervous systems."
15611,1644,Clinically significant neurologic manifestations affect approximately 20% of patients and may be the first manifestation of the disease in at least 25% of the cases.
15612,1644,"The spectrum of pSS-related neuropathies is wide including sensory neuropathies, neuronopathies, sensory-motor neuropathies, mononeuritis multiplex related to vasculitis Central nervous system involvement is composed by multiple sclerosis-like manifestations including acute and chronic myelopathies and by more diffuse manifestations (cognitive dysfunction, subacute aseptic meningitis, encephalopathy, psychiatric symptoms, chorea, seizures)."
15613,1644,The diagnosis and treatment of such pSS-related manifestations must be optimized in order to avoid severe disability.
15614,1645,"The purpose of this study was to discover and validate inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H3 (ITIH3) as novel biomarkers, and evaluate autoantibody isotypes against an unmodified and citrullinated ITIH3(542-556) peptide among Taiwanese female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), secondary Sjgren's syndrome in rheumatoid arthritis (RA-sSS), and healthy controls (HCs)."
15615,1645,"We used concanavalin A (Con A) affinity chromatography, 1-D SDS-PAGE, and label-free nano-LC-MS/MS to screen biomarker candidates (serum-derived Con A-captured proteins) and then identify PTMs of validated biomarkers (serum proteins) using pooled serum from 7 RA-sSS female patients and 7 age-matched HCs (the discovery set)."
15616,1645,"Furthermore, the protein level and autoantibody isotype analyses were further validated against individual serum from 18 HCs, 18 RA, 18 pSS, and 18 RA-sSS patients (the validation set)."
15617,1645,"Con A-bound ITIH3 was identified and validated as the only differentially expressed protein, which was elevated."
15618,1645,"Additionally, 2 novel PTMs in ITIH3 were identified and included citrullination at arginine-(546) and arginine-(556), and hexosamine at tryptophan-(558)."
15619,1645,"Further, concentrations of anti-citrullinatd-ITIH3(542-556) peptide autoantibodies significantly increased in patients with RA, pSS, and RA-sSS compared to HCs."
15620,1645,"Especially, autoantibody IgM against the citrullinated-ITIH3(542-556) peptide showed better diagnostic performance in discriminating both RA versus pSS and pSS versus RA-sSS."
15621,1645,"SIGNIFICANCE: By using comparative proteomic analysis of serum samples, the current study discovered and validates differentially expressed Con A-bound ITIH3 as a potential biomarker for secondary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthy controls (HCs)."
15622,1645,"Besides, hexosamine and citrullination on ITIH3 were further identified."
15623,1645,"Through analyzing autoantibody isotypes against the citrullinated ITIH3 peptide, patients with RA, primary SS, and RA-secondary SS, and HCs can be further discriminated."
15624,1645,The current strategy can be applied for identifying potential diagnostic and pathologic markers for autoimmune diseases.
15625,1646,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the contribution of a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily implicated in plasma cell survival, to the development of plasma cell-rich lesions in immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD)."
15626,1646,"METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical staining for APRIL with Stalk-1 and Aprily-8 antibodies specifically recognizing APRIL-producing cells and secreted APRIL, respectively, in renal and submandibular lesions of IgG4-RD in comparison with those of Sjgren's syndrome and sialolithiasis."
15627,1646,RESULTS: Numerous Stalk-1-positive APRIL-producing cells were detectable in lesions of IgG4-RD.
15628,1646,"These cells, identified as CD163-positive M2 macrophages, secreted APRIL that distributed close to and even on infiltrating plasma cells."
15629,1646,"In contrast, APRIL-producing cells and the secreted form of APRIL were rarely detectable in lesions of Sjgren's syndrome or sialolithiasis."
15630,1646,"Notably, APRIL expression decreased concomitantly with the level of plasma cell infiltration after successful glucocorticoid treatment."
15631,1646,CONCLUSIONS: Abundant infiltration into tissue lesions of APRIL-producing M2 macrophages and retention of secreted APRIL in plasma-cell-rich areas support a role for APRIL in the pathogenesis of plasma cell-rich lesions in IgG4-RD.
15632,1647,OBJECTIVES: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a female-dominant autoimmune disease characterized by androgen depletion and defective dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) processing enzymatic machinery in the salivary glands.
15633,1647,"We hypothesized that, because of these local failures, DHEA replacement therapy would be unable to improve the local androgen deficiency in SS salivary glands."
15634,1647,METHODS: DHEA-deficient female SS patients (n = 12) were treated with placebo for 4 months followed by DHEA 50 mg q.d.
15635,1647,for 4 months.
15636,1647,"Serum and saliva, collected in the morning before the trial and after both periods, were analysed for pro-hormones, androgens, and androgen metabolite using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)."
15637,1647,"RESULTS: DHEA treatment increased serum DHEA-sulfate from 1.3  0.1 to 6.4  1.3 M (p = 0.005), DHEA from 16.5  2.8 to 34.8  8.2 nM (p = 0.012), androstenedione from 3.1  0.3 to 17.2  1.9 nM (p = 0.002), free testosterone from 2.2  0.1 to 7.7  1.1 pM (p = 0.002), DHT from 275.5  24.4 to 834.6  122.8 pM (p = 0.002) and 3--diol-G from 3.8  0.6 to 13.6  2.0 nM (p = 0.001)."
15638,1647,"However, only salivary DHEA and DHT outputs increased significantly and 25% of the patients showed no increases, except for DHEA itself."
15639,1647,"Outputs of active androgens (T, DHT) and 3--diol-G metabolite correlated with salivation."
15640,1647,CONCLUSIONS: The local androgen deficiency in SS salivary glands is not only caused by low serum DHEA(-S) because restoration of systemic androgen levels by DHEA treatment did not correct local androgen depletion.
15641,1647,This could be explained by low or no capacity of DHEA-substituted patients to convert the pro-steroid to active androgen metabolites.
15642,1647,"Such intracrine failures affect women in particular, who must produce their salivary T and DHT locally from DHEA."
15643,1648,OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the clinical course of patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type lymphoma of the parotid gland and associated Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
15644,1648,METHODS: All consecutive patients with SS and MALT lymphoma (MALT-SS) diagnosed in the University Medical Center Groningen between January 1997 and January 2009 were analyzed.
15645,1648,Clinical course and treatment outcome of SS and MALT lymphoma were evaluated.
15646,1648,"RESULTS: From a total of 329 patients with SS, 35 MALT-SS patients were identified, with a median followup of 76 months (range 16-153 mo)."
15647,1648,MALT lymphoma was localized in the parotid gland in all cases.
15648,1648,"Treatment consisted of ""watchful waiting"" (n = 10), surgery (n = 3), radiotherapy (n = 1), surgery combined with radiotherapy (n = 2), rituximab only (n = 13), or rituximab combined with chemotherapy (n = 6)."
15649,1648,"Complete response was observed in 14 patients, partial response in 1 patient, and stable disease in 20 patients."
15650,1648,"In 6 of 7 patients with initially high SS disease activity (M-protein, cryoglobulins, IgM rheumatoid factor > 100 KIU/l, severe extraglandular manifestations), MALT lymphoma progressed and/or SS disease activity increased after a median followup of 39 months (range 4-98 mo), necessitating retreatment."
15651,1648,Only 1 patient with MALT who had low SS disease activity showed progression of lymphoma when left untreated.
15652,1648,CONCLUSION: An initially high SS disease activity likely constitutes an adverse prognostic factor for progression of lymphoma and/or SS.
15653,1648,Such patients may require treatment for both MALT lymphoma and SS.
15654,1648,"In SS patients with localized asymptomatic MALT lymphoma and low SS disease activity, a ""watchful waiting"" strategy seems justified."
15655,1649,"OBJECTIVE: Characterized by chronic inflammation, dysfunction of exocrine glands, and systemic autoimmunity, primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) is a common autoimmune disease in elderly women."
15656,1649,Our study was performed to explore the potential involvement of microRNA (miRNA) in Chinese patients with pSS.
15657,1649,"METHODS: Using microarrays, miRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was profiled in 4 female patients with pSS and 3 healthy participants, followed by a large-scale study of 33 patients and 10 healthy individuals."
15658,1649,"Compared to the healthy participants, 202 miRNA were upregulated and 180 were downregulated in the patients with pSS."
15659,1649,"To confirm this finding, a set of regulated miRNA was further examined in a large patient group, using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR assays."
15660,1649,"RESULTS: MiR-181a was the miRNA that most profoundly differed between patients with pSS and healthy individuals; however, similar miRNA-181a expression profiles were found in groups with different disease phenotypes."
15661,1649,"Together, these observations suggested that an elevated miRNA-181a level is a general phenomenon in Chinese patients with pSS."
15662,1649,"CONCLUSION: In addition to the elevated miR-181a levels, our study led to the speculation that elevated miR-181a levels in the PBMC of these patients compromise the maturation of B cells, enabling them to recognize and attack autoantigens and resulting in disease phenotypes."
15663,1649,"In addition to the regulation of human miRNA, many virus-derived miRNA were unexpectedly upregulated in the patients with pSS, suggesting that viral infection of PBMC plays a role in this disease."
15664,1650,We investigated the roles of autoantibodies to different Ro60 epitopes in lymphopenia in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
15665,1650,"We recruited 16 patients with SLE, 14 with pSS, and 10 healthy controls; all were female."
15666,1650,"Patients had active disease, had not received glucocorticoid or immunosuppressants for at least 3 months, and had positive laboratory tests for autoantibodies against Ro60."
15667,1650,"Patient peripheral blood lymphocyte (LC) counts were < 1 x 10(9)/L: (0.66  0.12) x 10(9)/L and (0.70  0.16) x 10(9)/L for SLE and pSS groups, respectively (P = 0.511)."
15668,1650,"LCs from each group were cultured in vitro with each of the three immunotoxins (ITs) (AE1-3), which specifically combine with one of the three epitopes (aa482-493, aa310-323, and aa230-241, respectively) on Ro60."
15669,1650,The cytotoxicity of each IT to the cultured LCs was measured by the MTT colorimetric method.
15670,1650,"The relationships between IT cytotoxicity and LC counts were analyzed, and autoantibodies against the three epitopes in patient peripheral blood were detected."
15671,1650,"All ITs showed cytotoxicity to control LCs; however, AE3 and AE2 showed greater toxicity to LCs from SLE and pSS groups, respectively, and the enhanced cytotoxicity was significantly associated with the respective LC counts (r = 0.653, P = 0.06; r = 0.594, P = 0.025)."
15672,1650,No difference was found in the prevalence of the autoantibodies between the SLE and pSS groups.
15673,1650,"These results suggest that autoantibodies to Ro60 might play a pathogenic role in lymphopenia in both SLE and pSS, but the pathogenic mechanisms might differ."
15674,1651,"Proteins that are important indicators of physiological or pathological states, can provide information for the identification of early and differential markers for disease."
15675,1651,"Saliva, contains an abundance of proteins, offers an easy, inexpensive, safe, and non-invasive approach for disease detection, and possesses a high potential to revolutionize the diagnostics."
15676,1651,Discovery of salivary biomarkers could be used to scrutinize health and disease surveillance.
15677,1651,The impact of human saliva proteome analysis in the search for clinically relevant disease biomarkers will be realized through advances made using proteomic technologies.
15678,1651,The advancements of emerging proteomic techniques have benefited biomarker research to the point where saliva is now recognized as an excellent diagnostic medium for the detection of disease.
15679,1651,"This review presents an overview of the value of saliva as a credible diagnostic tool and we aim to summarize the proteomic technologies currently used for global analysis of saliva proteins and to elaborate on the application of saliva proteomics to the discovery of disease biomarkers, and discuss some of the critical challenges and perspectives in this field."
15680,1652,OBJECTIVE: To identify interleukin (IL)-7R expression in the labial salivary gland (LSG) of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and non-Sjgren's syndrome sicca (nSS-sicca) and to study its correlation with glandular inflammation and IL-7 expression.
15681,1652,"METHODS: The presence of infiltrating immune cells and IL-7R cells in inflamed LSG of patients with pSS (n=12) and nSS-sicca controls (n=7) was studied by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis upon tissue digestion (n=15 and n=13, respectively)."
15682,1652,"Additionally, the correlations of IL-7R cells with hallmark disease parameters of pSS, major infiltrating inflammatory cells and IL-7 were assessed."
15683,1652,RESULTS: In the LSG of patients with pSS increased numbers of IL-7R cells were found as compared with nSS-sicca patients.
15684,1652,"IL7R cells strongly correlated with the lymphocytic focus score, IL-7 expression, the decrease in percentage of IgA plasma cells and numbers of CD3 T cells, CD20 B cells, and CD1a and CD208 myeloid dendritic cells."
15685,1652,"Analysis of isolated cells from the LSG demonstrated strongly increased percentages of IL-7R CD3 T cells in pSS as compared with nSS, showing abundant IL-7R expression on both CD4 and CD8 T cells."
15686,1652,Other CD45 leucocytes and CD45- tissue cells scarcely expressed IL-7R.
15687,1652,Percentages of IL-7R T cells also significantly correlated with glandular inflammation.
15688,1652,"CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the presence of increased IL-7R T cells in the LSG of patients with pSS and their association with the severity of sialadenitis, disease parameters and IL-7 expression."
15689,1652,"Considering the immunostimulatory ability of IL-7R T cells and IL-7, this suggests that IL-7(R)-dependent T cell-driven immune activation plays an important role in inflammation in pSS."
15690,1653,"Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are known to occur in Sjgren syndrome (SS) patients, but reported cases in labial salivary glands (LSG) are rare."
15691,1653,"We report a case of 60-year-old female patient with SS who developed MALT lymphoma in the labial salivary glands during a 2-year time interval when she was participating in the Sjgren's International Clinical Collaborative Alliance, an ongoing longitudinal multisite observational study funded by the National Institutes of Health of the United States."
15692,1653,"At follow-up exam, LSG biopsy showed atypical diffuse infiltration by mononuclear cells of variable size and atypical nuclei affecting the whole specimen with destruction of glandular architecture, leading to a diagnosis of B-cell MALT lymphoma."
15693,1653,Computerized tomography and bone marrow biopsy failed to show additional evidence of disease.
15694,1653,"Clinical, serologic, ocular, histologic and immunohistochemical findings are presented."
15695,1653,"A ""watch and wait"" policy was adopted with regular examinations."
15696,1654,"A 62-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and secondary Sjgren's syndrome took methotrexate (MTX) 5mg three times a week regularly but gradually developed an intermittent fever, oral ulcers and productive cough with mucopurulent sputum for about 2 weeks."
15697,1654,Image study found multiple nodular lesions and lymphadenopathies in bilateral lungs.
15698,1654,Empirical antibiotics for 1week failed to alleviate the fever.
15699,1654,"A transbronchial biopsy in the right fourth bronchus showed infiltration of abnormally enlarged lymphoid cells with a surface marker of CD20, some of which also stained positively in situ with Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA and some CD3(+) cells."
15700,1654,"After a diagnosis of MTX-associated lymphoproliferative disease had been made, MTX was discontinued immediately and intravenous methylprednisolone 125mg/day was given for 1week."
15701,1654,The clinical condition improved dramatically within 1month and there was no recurrence after 3-year follow-up.
15702,1655,OBJECTIVES: Pauci-immune ANCA-related glomerulonephritis (GN) is extremely uncommon in patients with underlying Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and its clinical and laboratory characteristics have not been previously explored.
15703,1655,"METHODS: We carried out a thorough literature review in order to establish predisposing factors, clinical and laboratory manifestations, kidney biopsy features, treatment modalities and response to treatment of biopsy proven ANCA-related pauci-immune GN in patients with SS."
15704,1655,"RESULTS: From 1967 to 2011, seven patients with a mean age of 6314.7 years were identified."
15705,1655,The average duration of SS prior to development of pauci-immune GN was 5062 months.
15706,1655,A high incidence of extraglandular manifestations was identified: 50% had interstitial lung disease and/or peripheral neuropathy.
15707,1655,All patients suffered from proteinuria (average 1397905 mg per 24 hours) and haematuria at presentation.
15708,1655,Almost 70% of patients suffered from severe anaemia (average haemoglobin 6.61.9 gr%).
15709,1655,"ANCA MPO was positive in all six patients, while ANCA PR3 was negative in all."
15710,1655,All patients received corticosteroids and 70% received cyclophosphamide.
15711,1655,One patient died and one patient developed end stage kidney disease.
15712,1655,The rest of the study patients had improved renal function over time.
15713,1655,CONCLUSIONS: Our study emphasises that patients with SS can present with atypical kidney pathology as ANCA-related GN.
15714,1655,"Thus, high clinical awareness is warranted to establish correct diagnoses."
15715,1655,"Given the powerful impact of kidney pathology on management of these patients and responsiveness to treatment demonstrated in our case series, the significance of timely diagnosis can not be overestimated."
15716,1656,OBJECTIVES: Multiomics study was conducted to elucidate the crucial molecular mechanisms of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) pathology.
15717,1656,"METHODS: We generated multiple data set from well-defined patients with SS, which includes whole-blood transcriptomes, serum proteomes and peripheral immunophenotyping."
15718,1656,"Based on our newly generated data, we performed an extensive bioinformatic investigation."
15719,1656,"RESULTS: Our integrative analysis identified SS gene signatures (SGS) dysregulated in widespread omics layers, including epigenomes, mRNAs and proteins."
15720,1656,SGS predominantly involved the interferon signature and ADAMs substrates.
15721,1656,"Besides, SGS was significantly overlapped with SS-causing genes indicated by a genome-wide association study and expression trait loci analyses."
15722,1656,Combining the molecular signatures with immunophenotypic profiles revealed that cytotoxic CD8 -T cells- were associated with SGS.
15723,1656,"Further, we observed the activation of SGS in cytotoxic CD8 T cells isolated from patients with SS."
15724,1656,CONCLUSIONS: Our multiomics investigation identified gene signatures deeply associated with SS pathology and showed the involvement of cytotoxic CD8 T cells.
15725,1656,These integrative relations across multiple layers will facilitate our understanding of SS at the system level.
15726,1657,Compelling evidence suggests that interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-17-producing cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
15727,1657,We investigated phenotypical and functional effects of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (RTX) on circulating and glandular IL-17-producing T cells in pSS.
15728,1657,RTX is able to deplete glandular IL-17(+) CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) double-negative (DN) and CD4(+) Th17 cells as well as circulating IL-17(+) DN T cells.
15729,1657,"A fraction of glandular and circulating IL-17(+) DN cells and CD4(+) T helper type 17 (Th17) cells co-expresses CD20 on the cell surface explaining, at least in part, such depletive capacity of RTX."
15730,1657,The exposure to RTX does not rescue the in-vitro corticosteroid resistance of IL-17(+) DN T cells.
15731,1657,"Our results support further the therapeutic role in pSS of RTX that, despite its B cell specificity, appears able to also hamper IL-17-producing T cells in this disease."
15732,1658,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands.
15733,1658,"Due to the absence of specific clinical manifestations and biomarkers in the early stage, pSS is generally underrecognized."
15734,1658,"To elucidate the role of the tissue-specific autoantibodies (TSAs), i.e., anti-CA6, anti-SP1, and anti-PSP antibodies, we enrolled 137 pSS patients, 32 secondary Sjgren's syndrome (sSS) patients, and 127 healthy controls (HCs), whose serum and saliva samples were collected."
15735,1658,"TSA levels were detected by ELISA, and the clinical and laboratory data was reviewed from the medical records."
15736,1658,"The analysis results showed the following: (1) Compared to HCs, the serum IgA levels of anti-CA6, anti-SP1 and anti-PSP were significantly higher in pSS as well as in sSS patients, and anti-CA6 IgG was also notably higher in pSS patients."
15737,1658,"(2) The positivity of anti-CA6, anti-PSP and all the three antibodies together were significantly increased in anti-SSA-negative pSS patients."
15738,1658,(3) The average IgM levels of anti-CA6 and anti-SP1 decreased as the disease duration extended.
15739,1658,"(4) The anti-CA6-positive patients have significantly higher levels of serum IgA, while the anti-PSP-positive group has a notably higher serum IgM level."
15740,1658,"(5) Another autoantibody specific to the salivary glands, anti--fodrin antibody, was elevated in TSA-positive patients, especially in the anti-CA6-positive group."
15741,1658,(6) Preliminary detection of saliva TSAs showed that all the IgG levels of these three antibodies increased significantly in pSS patients.
15742,1658,"In conclusion, TSAs improve diagnosis of pSS in the early stage, especially in anti-SSA-negative patients, and their tissue-specific nature indicates localized salivary injury, which deserves further studies to clarify the mechanism."
15743,1659,OBJECTIVE: To determine whether interleukin (IL)-33 and soluble ST2 (sST2) are associated with primary Sjogren's Syndrome (pSS).
15744,1659,METHODS: Serum levels of IL-33 and sST2 in 110 pSS patients and 78 healthy controls were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
15745,1659,"Immunoglobulins, rheumatoid factors (RF), antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-SSA/RO-52 antibody, anti-SSB antibody and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were measured by standard laboratory techniques."
15746,1659,Interstitial lung disease (ILD) was identified on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).
15747,1659,Disease activity in pSS was scored with the European League Against Rheumatism Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI).
15748,1659,"RESULTS: Serum levels of IL-33 and sST2 were significantly elevated in pSS patients, especially in patients with ILD."
15749,1659,"There was significant positive correlation between IL-33 and RF, anti-SSB antibody."
15750,1659,CONCLUSION: IL-33/sST2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of pSS and partly contribute to the ILD in pSS patients.
15751,1660,BACKGROUND: We analyzed the performance of a novel ENA screening chemiluminescent immunoassay (CIA) and the confirmation QUANTA Flash tests.
15752,1660,METHODS: Sera (n=1079) from patients referred to a rheumatology clinic were screened by QUANTA Flash ENA7 (INOVA Diagnostics).
15753,1660,All positive (n=89) and a matched control group (n=90) were reflexed for autoantibodies to the individual antigens.
15754,1660,"Moreover, sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n=252), systemic sclerosis (SSc, n=64), polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM, n=72), Sjgren's syndrome (SjS, n=39) as well as disease controls (n=605) were tested by ENA7 CIA and by Quanta Lite ENA6 ELISA (INOVA)."
15755,1660,"RESULTS: 89/1079 (8.3%) samples were ENA7 CIA positive with the following reactivity profile: RNP (36.0%), Sm (13.5%), Scl-70 (9.0%), Jo-1 (0.0%), Ro60 (44.9%), Ro52 (39.3%) and SS-B (24.7%)."
15756,1660,"In the negative group, the reactivity profile was: RNP (1.1%), Sm (1.1%), Scl-70 (2.2%) and 0.0% for Jo-1, Ro60, Ro52 and SS-B."
15757,1660,The positive/negative/total agreements (ENA7 CIA vs. confirmation assays) were 95.3%/91.5%/93.3%.
15758,1660,"The sensitivity of the ENA7 CIA was 62.3% in SLE, 54.7% in SSc, 92.3% in SjS, 50.0% in PM/DM, and 61.8% in the total systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD) population (specificity 95.0%)."
15759,1660,CONCLUSION: The QUANTA Flash ENA7 CIA is a reliable screening test.
15760,1661,"AIMS: Sjgren Syndrome is a disorder involving oral tissues, with xerostomia, dysgeusia, dysphagia, tooth decay, gingivitis, angular cheilitis and glossitis."
15761,1661,Temporomandibular disorders are a generic term referred to clinical conditions involving the jaw muscles and temporomandibular joint.
15762,1661,The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of oral manifestations and temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in Sjgren Syndrome (SS) patients compared with healthy people.
15763,1661,"METHODS: The study group included 72 SS patients (2 men, 70 women) diagnosed according to the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) Criteria."
15764,1661,"A randomly selected group of 72 patients, matched by sex and age, served as control group."
15765,1661,The examination for TMD signs and symptoms was based on the standardized Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) through a questionnaire and clinical examination.
15766,1661,"RESULTS: SS patients complained more frequently (95.8%) of oral symptoms (xerostomia, dysgeusia, dysphagia) than controls (22.2%) ((2)= 80.66 p< 0.001)."
15767,1661,"TMD symptoms (muscle pain on chewing, difficulty in mouth opening, arthralgia, headaches, tinnitus) were complained by 91.7% of SS patients and by 84.7% of controls ((2)= 1,667 p= 0,196)."
15768,1661,"At the clinical examination, 91,7% of SS had at least one oral sign respect to 75 % of controls."
15769,1661,"The salivary flow measurements showed high statistical significance between the two groups (Unpaired test, p< 0,0001)."
15770,1661,"Myofascial pain (caused by muscular contracture) was significantly higher in the study group than in the control one (p 0,05)."
15771,1661,"Furthermore 18,05% of SS patients showed deflection versus 5,5% of controls ((2)=5,402 p=0,020)."
15772,1661,CONCLUSIONS: Sjgren's Syndrome seems to play a role in temporomandibular joint disorders.
15773,1662,INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in patients with the diagnosis of SpA has been reported to be higher than normal population.
15774,1662,"Yet, the vice-versa is unclear."
15775,1662,"In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of IBP, radiologic sacroiliitis and SpA in patients with primary SS."
15776,1662,METHODS: 85 patients followed at the rheumatology clinics of the Marmara and Kocaeli Universities with the diagnosis of primary SS between November 2011 and August 2012 were included in this study.
15777,1662,The control group consisted of 100 age-and gender-matched patients.
15778,1662,Inflammatory back pain and axial SpA were diagnosed according to the assessment of spondylo arthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria.
15779,1662,RESULTS: 83 patients were (97%) female and 2 (3%) were male.
15780,1662,Mean age of the patients was 49.1 (11) years.
15781,1662,Mean disease duration was 7.3 (4) years.
15782,1662,The patient and control groups were comparable in terms of age and gender (p > 0.05).
15783,1662,"Inflammatory back pain was observed in 21 (24.7%) of 85 primary SS patients and in 4 (4%) of 100 control subjects (p < 0.001), radiographic sacroiliitis was demonstrated in 9 (10.5%) of primary SS patients and 2 (2%) of the control subjects (p = 0.025)."
15784,1662,Remaining SpA findings were not encountered in either group.
15785,1662,CONCLUSION: inflammatory back pain and radiologic sacroiliitis is increased in patients with primary SS.
15786,1662,"Whether IBP, SI joint inflammation and radiologic sacroiliitis is due to the co-existence of SpA and primary SS or IBP is an underdiagnosed clinical feature of SS deserves further studies of large patient numbers."
15787,1663,OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of anti--fodrin antibodies (AFA) in combination with rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or antinuclear antibodies (ANA) as an alternative immunological criterion for Sjgren syndrome (SS) among patients with negative anti-Ro/La serology.
15788,1663,"METHODS: The study included 350 patients (100 with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and systemic sclerosis, and 50 with primary SS) randomly selected and assessed for SS."
15789,1663,"All patients were tested for ANA, RF, anti-SSA/SSB, and AFA antibodies."
15790,1663,"SS diagnosis was made on a clinical basis by 2 rheumatologists based on the 6-item screening questionnaire, Schirmer-I test, nonstimulated whole salivary flow rate, fluorescein staining test, autoantibodies, lip biopsy, and medical chart review."
15791,1663,Non-SS was defined as lack of clinical diagnosis and not fulfilling the American-European Consensus Group classification criteria and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.
15792,1663,"The ACR criteria were applied substituting the immunological criteria as follows: (1) RF plus ANA > 1:320, (2) RF plus AFA, (3) ANA > 1:320 plus AFA, (4) RF alone, and (5) 2 positive tests out of RF, ANA > 1:320, or AFA."
15793,1663,"We estimated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and likelihood ratio positivity with 95% CI for each criterion."
15794,1663,"RESULTS: There were 236 patients (67%) who tested negative for anti-SSA/SSB antibodies, of whom 65 (27.5%) were clinically diagnosed as SS, and 149 (63%) with non-SS."
15795,1663,RF + AFA and ANA + AFA performed similarly to RF + ANA > 1:320.
15796,1663,"The model 2 out of 3 of RF, ANA, or AFA improved the sensitivity from 56.9% to 70.7%, although the specificity decreased."
15797,1663,"CONCLUSION: The combination AFA + RF, AFA + ANA > 1:320, or at least 2 out of 3, performed well as a proxy immunological test for patients with SS and negative Ro/La serology."
15798,1664,An association between thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is rare.
15799,1664,This is the first report of two patients with TTP who had inhibitory autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats) complicating primary SS.
15800,1664,"A rapid diagnosis of TTP, which is a potentially lethal condition, made it possible to treat the two cases successfully."
15801,1664,Only eight similar cases with TTP complicating SS have been reported in the literature.
15802,1664,"The possible presentation of primary SS without classic sicca symptoms, but with haematological abnormalities including TTP, should be recognised."
15803,1664,"Furthermore, it is important to measure ADAMTS13 activity and anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, because TTP with SS seems to be a concurrent overlapping autoimmune disorder."
15804,1664,"We suggest that plasma exchanges in combination with corticosteroids should be administered as early as possible, since they appeared to be effective in treating TTP with SS, including in our cases."
15805,1665,Fistulas between systemic and pulmonary arteries are associated with various underlying etiologies and cause pulmonary hypertension (PH).
15806,1665,Diagnosis of this condition requires several imaging studies and the exclusion of other possible causes of PH.
15807,1665,We herein report a case of a patient with interstitial pneumonia and scleroderma.
15808,1665,The imaging revealed multiple fistulas involving the inferior phrenic and left lower pulmonary arteries.
15809,1665,"The fistulas were closed using coils, but the PH remained presumably due to other undiagnosed fistulas."
15810,1665,The improvement of symptoms following use of a supplementary pulmonary vasodilator provides the hope that the chosen treatment could be a viable alternative approach for other similar cases.
15811,1666,"INTRODUCTION: In Sjgren's syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye) is associated with infiltration of lacrimal glands by leukocytes and consequent losses of tear-fluid production and the integrity of the ocular surface."
15812,1666,We investigated the effect of blockade of the lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTBR) pathway on lacrimal-gland pathology in the NOD mouse model of Sjgren's syndrome.
15813,1666,"METHODS: Male NOD mice were treated for up to ten weeks with an antagonist, LTBR-Ig, or control mouse antibody MOPC-21."
15814,1666,"Extra-orbital lacrimal glands were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for high endothelial venules (HEV), by Affymetrix gene-array analysis and real-time PCR for differential gene expression, and by ELISA for CXCL13 protein."
15815,1666,Leukocytes from lacrimal glands were analyzed by flow-cytometry.
15816,1666,Tear-fluid secretion-rates were measured and the integrity of the ocular surface was scored using slit-lamp microscopy and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) staining.
15817,1666,The chemokine CXCL13 was measured by ELISA in sera from Sjgren's syndrome patients (n = 27) and healthy controls (n = 30).
15818,1666,"Statistical analysis was by the two-tailed, unpaired T-test, or the Mann-Whitney-test for ocular integrity scores."
15819,1666,"RESULTS: LTBR blockade for eight weeks reduced B-cell accumulation (approximately 5-fold), eliminated HEV in lacrimal glands, and reduced the entry rate of lymphocytes into lacrimal glands."
15820,1666,"Affymetrix-chip analysis revealed numerous changes in mRNA expression due to LTBR blockade, including reduction of homeostatic chemokine expression."
15821,1666,"The reduction of CXCL13, CCL21, CCL19 mRNA and the HEV-associated gene GLYCAM-1 was confirmed by PCR analysis."
15822,1666,"CXCL13 protein increased with disease progression in lacrimal-gland homogenates, but after LTBR blockade for 8 weeks, CXCL13 was reduced approximately 6-fold to 8.4 pg/mg (+/- 2.7) from 51 pg/mg (+/-5.3) in lacrimal glands of 16 week old control mice."
15823,1666,"Mice given LTBR blockade exhibited an approximately two-fold greater tear-fluid secretion than control mice (P = 0.001), and had a significantly improved ocular surface integrity score (P = 0.005)."
15824,1666,"The mean CXCL13 concentration in sera from Sjgren's patients (n = 27) was 170 pg/ml, compared to 92.0 pg/ml for sera from (n = 30) healthy controls (P = 0.01)."
15825,1666,CONCLUSIONS: Blockade of LTBR pathways may have therapeutic potential for treatment of Sjgren's syndrome.
15826,1667,OBJECTIVE.
15827,1667,Renal involvement is a rare event during primary SS (pSS).
15828,1667,We aimed to describe the clinico-biological and histopathological characteristics of pSS-related nephropathy and its response to treatment.
15829,1667,METHODS.
15830,1667,"We conducted a French nationwide, retrospective, multicentre study including pSS patients fulfilling American-European Consensus Group criteria or enlarged American-European Consensus Group criteria, and with biopsy-proven renal involvement."
15831,1667,RESULTS.
15832,1667,A total of 95 patients were included (median age 49 years).
15833,1667,An estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of <60 ml/min was found in 82/95 patients (86.3%).
15834,1667,"Renal biopsy demonstrated tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) in 93 patients (97.9%), and frequent (75%) plasma cell infiltrates."
15835,1667,"Glomerular lesions were found in 22 patients (23.2%), mainly related to cryoglobulin."
15836,1667,The presence of anti-SSA (76.8%) and anti-SSB (53.8%) antibodies was particularly frequent among patients with TIN and was associated with a worse renal prognosis.
15837,1667,"Eighty-one patients (85.3%) were treated, with CSs in 80 (98.8%) and immunosuppressive agents (mostly rituximab) in 21 cases (25.9%)."
15838,1667,"Despite marked interstitial fibrosis at initial biopsy, kidney function improved significantly during the 12-month period following diagnosis (final eGFR 49.9 vs 39.8 ml/min/1.73 m 2 at baseline, P < 0.001)."
15839,1667,No proven benefit of immunosuppressive agents over steroid therapy alone was found in this study.
15840,1667,CONCLUSION.
15841,1667,"Renal involvement of pSS is mostly due to TIN with marked T, B and especially plasma cell infiltration."
15842,1667,Renal dysfunction is usually isolated but can be severe.
15843,1667,"Use of CSs can improve the eGFR, but further studies are needed to define the best therapeutic strategy in this disease."
15844,1668,"A 67-year-old woman, who had been treated for Sjgren syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis for 10 years, was consulted for examination of multiple nodular pulmonary nodules."
15845,1668,"She has been pointed out multiple pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography (CT) for 7 years, of which the number and the size gradually increased."
15846,1668,"When visuting our hospital, approximately 20 nodules up to 10 mm in size were noted."
15847,1668,"Thoracoscopic resection of the nodule was performed and histological diagnosis was amyloid, which was negative for A- and P- component and positive for transthyretin."
15848,1668,Neither amyloid deposition in other organs nor abnormal protein in serum and urine was detected.
15849,1668,The diagnosis of localized nodular pulmonary amyloidosis was established.
15850,1668,"As far as our knowledge, this is the 1st report of transthyretin amyloidosis with Sjgren syndrome."
15851,1669,"Despite the established association between chronic idiopathic/spontaneous urticaria (CIU) and presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), the prevalence of autoimmune comorbidities in this population has not been analyzed."
15852,1669,"Here, we aim to identify clinical and laboratory manifestations associated with ANA-positive CIU."
15853,1669,ANA-positive patients were identified via electronic data capture from the electronic patient record database of Leumit Health care Services (LHS) of Israel.
15854,1669,"Patient characteristics, medical histories, and details of diagnostic workup, medical treatment, and follow-up were retrieved by performing a chart review of electronic patient records (EPRs)."
15855,1669,"The prevalence of target diseases among ANA(+) CIU(+), ANA(+) CIU(-), and ANA(-) CIU(+) patients was calculated."
15856,1669,"A total of 91 ANA(+) CIU(+), 3131 ANA(+) CIU(-), and 478 ANA(-) CIU(+) patients were identified."
15857,1669,"The ANA(+) CIU(+) group was characterized by higher prevalence of Sjgren's syndrome (SS)-A 52 antibodies (Ab) (7.7% versus 2.4%; p = 0.008), SS-A 60 Ab (11% versus 2.8%; p = < 0.001), and SS-B Ab (14.3% versus 3.2%; p < 0.001), compared with ANA(-) CIU(+) group."
15858,1669,"Additionally, ANA(+) CIU(+) patients were more likely to be diagnosed with thyroid autoimmune diseases, higher C-reactive protein (6.4  10.3 versus 4.1  8.8 mg/L; p = 0.027), and more profound basopenia (0.04  0.09 versus 0.15  0.11 cell/mm(3); p < 0.001) than ANA(-) CIU patients."
15859,1669,More ANA(+) CIU(+) patients were resistant to four-fold standard licensed doses of antihistamines than ANA(-) CIU(+) patients [11 (12.1%) versus 29 (6.1%); p = 0.046].
15860,1669,"ANA-positive CIU is characterized by higher prevalence of SS-A 52, SS-A 60, and SS-B antibodies and poorer clinical response to antihistamine medications."
15861,1670,Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is extremely rare in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc).
15862,1670,"So far, only two cases of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis in SSc were described in the literature."
15863,1670,"This report is about a patient with SSc and secondary Sjgren's syndrome, who developed typical clinical features of small-vessel vasculitis, including arthritis, purpura, microhaematuria, gangrene of fingers, and toes and myocardial ischemia, in the presence of mixed cryoglobulinemia, ANA, rheumatoid factor, and anti-SSA/Ro antibodies."
15864,1670,"Symptoms and signs of vasculitis worsened despite initial treatment with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, but improved significantly when mycophenolate mofetil was used instead cyclophosphamide."
15865,1671,OBJECTIVE: Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) are considered specific markers of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and have been included in the revised classification criteria for RA diagnosis.
15866,1671,"However, these antibodies have also been detected in patients with other types of chronic inflammatory rheumatism."
15867,1671,"Our objectives were to identify the prevalence of positive anti-CCP patients in non-RA diseases, to determine the diagnostic value of anti-CCP for the diagnosis of RA, to specify the clinical characteristics of non-RA patients positive for anti-CCP, and to determine the discriminatory value of the levels of anti-CCP in patients among the various diseases."
15868,1671,METHODS: We carried out an observational and descriptive study.
15869,1671,All the determinations of anti-CCP requested by the 2 rheumatology departments at Cochin Hospital over a period of 18 months were analyzed.
15870,1671,Such determinations were requested for 1162 patients in total.
15871,1671,"Anti-CCP levels were determined with the Euro Diagnostica ELISA kit, with values  25 U for this test being considered positive."
15872,1671,The diagnosis of rheumatic conditions was the responsibility of the treating physician.
15873,1671,RESULTS: Anti-CCP antibodies were detected in 357 (30.7%) of the 1162 patients.
15874,1671,"The prevalence of anti-CCP was 292/417 (70.0%) in RA, 13/122 (10.6%) in patients with psoriatic arthritis, 13/62 (20.9%) in patients with unclassified rheumatism, 11/33 (33.3%) in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome, 5/30 (16.6%) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 3/28 (10.7%) in patients with mixed connective tissue disorder, 3/36 (8.3%) in patients with systemic sclerosis, 7/44 (15.9%) in patients with juvenile arthritis, and 6/220 (2.7%) in patients with noninflammatory diseases."
15875,1671,"In the population of patients positive for anti-CCP, mean anti-CCP levels were 869.4 ( 978.4) U/ml, with no significant difference between RA [854.8 ( 959.8) U/ml] and any of the non-RA conditions [922.7 ( 1070.0) U/ml]."
15876,1671,"CONCLUSION: Anti-CCP are a hallmark of RA, but may be observed in other inflammatory, systemic, or mechanical diseases."
15877,1671,"In this large cohort of patients, the presence of second-generation anti-CCP (anti-CCP2) antibodies is useful in diagnosing RA (70% sensitivity, 91.3% specificity), but examining the levels of these antibodies does not appear to offer further discriminatory power among patients who are anti-CCP2-positive."
15878,1672,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) can be distinguished based on the expression of human T cell lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-1) and, if so, whether the subgroups differ in their clinical features and serological measures."
15879,1672,"METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested PCR were used to amplify viral DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in 53 patients with SS, using primers from the HTLV-1 pX, p19, pol, and tax regions."
15880,1672,Minor salivary gland biopsy specimens from 33 patients with SS were examined for the presence of HTLV-1 p19 or tax proteins immunohistochemically.
15881,1672,"The sociodemographic, glandular, and extraglandular manifestations, and laboratory findings including autoantibodies, complement, and immunoglobulin levels, were analyzed."
15882,1672,"RESULTS: The HTLV-1 tax gene was detected in PBMC samples from 2 of 53 patients (3.8%), whereas the HTLV-1 pX, p19, and pol genes were not expressed."
15883,1672,"As well, 100% of PBMC samples from 4 family members of patients in whom the tax gene was detected also expressed the tax gene."
15884,1672,Immunohistochemical staining for HTLV-1 p19 and tax was seen in 10 out of 33 (30.3%) patients with SS each.
15885,1672,"Overall, 14 (42.4%) patients expressed HTLV-1 p19 or tax proteins, and they had lower rheumatoid factor and C3 levels (p = 0.015 and p = 0.005, respectively) and higher lymphocyte counts (p = 0.016)."
15886,1672,The prevalence of glandular and extraglandular manifestations did not differ between the HTLV-1-positive and negative patients.
15887,1672,"CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that HTLV-1 in the salivary glands is involved in the pathogenesis of a subpopulation of SS, and HTLV-1-associated SS might have different immunological patterns than idiopathic SS."
15888,1673,"The autoimmune exocrinopathy, Sjgren's syndrome (SS), is associated with secretory defects in patients, including individuals with mild lymphocytic infiltration and minimal glandular damage."
15889,1673,The mechanism(s) underlying the secretory dysfunction is not known.
15890,1673,We have used minor salivary gland biopsies from SS patients and healthy individuals to assess acinar cell function in morphologically intact glandular areas.
15891,1673,"We report that agonist-regulated intracellular Ca(2+) release, critically required for Ca(2+) entry and fluid secretion, is defective in acini from SS patients."
15892,1673,"Importantly, these acini displayed reduction in IP3R2 and IP3R3, but not AQP5 or STIM1."
15893,1673,"Similar decreases in IP3R and carbachol (CCh)-stimulated [Ca(2+)]i elevation were detected in acinar cells from lymphotoxin-alpha (LT) transgenic (TG) mice, a model for (SS)."
15894,1673,"Treatment of salivary glands from healthy individuals with LT , a cytokine linked to disease progression in SS and IL14 mice, reduced Ca(2+) signaling."
15895,1673,"Together, our findings reveal novel IP3R deficits in acinar cells that underlie secretory dysfunction in SS patients."
15896,1674,"INTRODUCTION: To recognize the connective tissue diseases (CTD), which include lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and Systemic sclerosis (SSc) it is necessary to determine the presence of autoantibodies (Ab)."
15897,1674,There is still work going on to find effective and equivocal detection methods.
15898,1674,"THE AIM OF STUDY: To evaluate the usefulness, clinical value and innovativeness of the Polycheck method in the detection of autoantibodies in patients with connective tissue diseases."
15899,1674,MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 178 people: 153 patients of the Department of Rheumatology and 25 healthy people.
15900,1674,"According to the main diagnosis the patients were divided into 3 groups: SLE-59, ZS-45, SSc-49."
15901,1674,"The presence and concentrations of Ab were determined by using multiparametric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Polycheck Rheuma (Biocheck, GmbH, Mnster, Germany)."
15902,1674,Statistical data analysis was performed using Statistica v10.0.
15903,1674,"RESULTS: In our study we found thatthe frequency of antibodies characteristic of the SS: anti-SS-A/Ro 52, anti-SS-A Ro 60 and anti-SS-B/La was significantly higher in patients with SS group compared to TRU, TU, and GK (p <0.05); concentrations of Ab were lower in TRU and in SSc group."
15904,1674,Marker Ab for SLE anti-dsDNA were only present in patients with SLE.
15905,1674,Anti-Sm antibodies were more common in this patient population too.
15906,1674,"Antibodies associated with diagnosis of SSc anti-SCL-70 and anti-CENP B were significantly more often observed in patients with SSc in higher concentrations compared to the other groups examined (anti-SCL-70 p<0,0005)."
15907,1674,The Ab concentration analysis performed with use of this analysis help us to confirm diagnosis in particular patients.
15908,1674,CONCLUSIONS: The multiparametric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Polycheck Rheuma is helpful in making a quick and comprehensive identification of autoantibodies in pts with suspected CTD.
15909,1674,The concentration analysis performed with use of this method enables an accurate diagnosis despite the ambiguous clinical picture.
15910,1675,"Herein we report a case of sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM) occurring at an unusually young age in a patient with primary Sjgren syndrome, and use the case to explore possible shared mechanisms for disease susceptibility."
15911,1675,"Possible factors may include the association of both conditions with the 8.1 ancestral haplotype; the presence of anti-cN1A antibodies, which, although considered specific for sIBM, are also seen in pSS; and the shared association with T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL)."
15912,1675,Further evaluation of this patient did in fact reveal underlying T-LGLL and mechanisms by which T cells in sIBM may escape immune regulation and contribute to disease phenotype are explored.
15913,1675,"Despite myofiber infiltration with CD8-positive T cells in sIBM, and, although sIBM is traditionally considered treatment-refractory, we report a significant response to the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, and discuss possible mechanisms by which this response may be mediated."
15914,1676,Saliva is vital for the maintenance of normal oral physiology and mucosal health.
15915,1676,"The loss of salivary function can have far-reaching consequences, as observed with dry mouth, which is associated with increased orodental disease, speech impairment, dysphagia, and a significant negative effect on quality of life."
15916,1676,"The timely diagnosis of oral dryness is vital for the management of orodental disease and any associated often-undiagnosed systemic disease (e.g., Sjgren syndrome)."
15917,1676,"Our aim was to investigate differences in mucin glycoproteins and saliva rheological properties between sufferers and nonsufferers of dry mouth in order to understand the relationship between saliva composition, rheological properties, and dryness perception and provide additional potential diagnostic markers."
15918,1676,"All patients exhibited objective and subjective oral dryness, irrespective of etiology."
15919,1676,"Over half of the patients (n = 20, 58.8%) had a saliva secretion rate above the gland dysfunction cutoff of 0.1 mL/min."
15920,1676,Mucin (MUC5B and MUC7) concentrations were generally similar or higher in patients.
15921,1676,"Despite the abundance of these moisture-retaining proteins, patients exhibited reduced mucosal hydration (wetness) and significantly lower saliva spinnbarkeit (stringiness), suggesting a loss of the lubricating and retention/adhesion properties of saliva, which, at least partially, are associated with mucin glycoproteins."
15922,1676,Over 90% of patients with dry mouth (DMPs) consistently had unstimulated whole mouth saliva (UWMS) spinnbarkeit below the proposed normal cutoff (10 mm).
15923,1676,Further analysis of mucins revealed the reduced glycosylation of mucins in DMPs compared to healthy controls.
15924,1676,Our data indicate that UWMS mucin concentrations are not reduced in dry mouth but that the mucin structure (glycosylation) is altered.
15925,1676,"UWMS from DMPs had reduced spinnbarkeit, the assessment of which, in conjunction with sialometry, could improve sensitivity for the diagnosis of dry mouth."
15926,1676,"Additionally, it may be useful to take into consideration the altered mucin glycosylation and saliva rheological properties when designing synthetic or purified mucins for saliva substitutes and dry mouth therapy."
15927,1677,BACKGROUND: It has been recently observed that small fibre neuropathy (SFN) may present as distal symmetrical polyneuropathy and with atypical non-length-dependent pattern.
15928,1677,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a small series of patients with non-length-dependent SFN, investigating corneal innervation with corneal confocal microscopy (CCM)."
15929,1677,METHODS: Evaluation of the corneal nerve fibre density using CCM in six women with non-length-dependent SFN.
15930,1677,"The patients were characterised by sensory disturbance involving proximal regions of the limbs, face and trunks, and the diagnosis was confirmed by the findings of decreased intraepidermal nerve fibre density on skin biopsy."
15931,1677,"RESULTS: Six women, aged 35-64, had non-length-dependent SFN, related to Crohn disease, impaired glucose tolerance and Sjgren's syndrome, or idiopathic (three cases)."
15932,1677,"In all patients, CCM demonstrated decreased corneal nerve fibre density (12.5-23.4/mm(2); normal, >30.6/mm(2))."
15933,1677,CONCLUSION: Non-length-dependent SFN may represent an intriguing diagnostic problem because of its puzzling presentation and the need for special investigations for its confirmation.
15934,1677,"In this perspective, CCM may provide a useful, non-invasive tool to complement the diagnostic workup."
15935,1678,Epigenetic deregulation of genes encoded on the X chromosome as reported for CD40L in lupus could explain the female predominance of autoimmune diseases.
15936,1678,We compared CD40L expression on CD4(+) T cells from primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) women and healthy controls and investigated DNA methylation patterns of the promoter and enhancer regions of CD40L.
15937,1678,The expression of CD40L on activated CD4(+) T cells was higher in patients with pSS than controls after phorbolmyristate acetate and ionomycin activation (P = 0.02).
15938,1678,CD40L mRNA level in CD4(+) T cells did not differ between patients with pSS and controls and was similar in both groups in cultures treated with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine C. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed no significant differences in methylation profiles between patients and controls.
15939,1678,Inducible membrane-bound CD40L on CD4(+) T cells is increased in patients with pSS but was not related to epigenetic deregulation by demethylation patterns of the regulatory regions of CD40L.
15940,1679,"OBJECTIVE: To examine differences in number and size of signal hyperintensities (SH) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) and controls who all had frequent episodic tension-type headache (FETH), and to investigate their relation to platelet serotonin level (PSL), patient age, disease duration, and activity."
15941,1679,"METHODS: SH in 22 pSS patients with FETH were compared to 20 aged-matched controls with FETH, using the modified semiquantitative rating scale."
15942,1679,"Spectrofluorimetry was used for determination of PSL, and the European League Against Rheumatism SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) for disease activity assessment."
15943,1679,RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in the total number of SH were noted infratentorially (p = 0.025) and in the basal ganglia for lesions of diameter > 5 mm (p = 0.048).
15944,1679,Significant correlations were found between disease duration and number of overall lesions > 5 mm (p = 0.04) and subcortical lesions of diameter 2-5 mm (p = 0.035).
15945,1679,"Number of periventricular SH inversely correlated to PSL (p = 0.019) and to patient age (p = 0.004), without association with markers of immunoinflammation and ESSDAI."
15946,1679,"CONCLUSION: Our study showed that SH on brain MRI are more common in specific regions of the brain in pSS patients with FETH than in controls with FETH, signifying a more widespread cerebral vasculopathy in SS patients with FETH."
15947,1679,"Periventricular SH seem to be associated to increased platelet serotonin release in pSS patients with FETH and correlated with disease duration, without correlation to the actual ESSDAI and markers of immunoinflammation, and might be linked with chronic immunoinflammation of low-grade intensity and vasculitis in pSS."
15948,1680,Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a significant complication of Sjgren syndrome (SS) associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
15949,1680,"The mainstay of treatment remains corticosteroid administration, with or without additional immunosuppressive therapies."
15950,1680,Preliminary studies in SS have shown benefit in glandular and serologic parameters following treatment with the CTLA4 immunoglobulin fusion protein abatacept.
15951,1680,"Topical tacrolimus has been effective for ocular symptoms in SS, but systemic therapy has not been reported."
15952,1680,"We describe the first case, to our knowledge, of the successful use of a combination of systemic tacrolimus and abatacept in severe refractory SS and related ILD."
15953,1681,Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) play key roles in regulating autoimmunity and immunity balance.
15954,1681,"LncRNA TMEVPG1, which is encoded by a gene located near the Ifn gene, contributes to interferon gamma expression."
15955,1681,We investigated the expression of TMEVPG1 in patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS) to determine its role in the pathogenesis of SS.
15956,1681,"In this study, we detected the relative expression of TMEVPG1 in CD4(+) T cells of 25 SS patients and 25 healthy donors."
15957,1681,"Moreover, the proportion of Th1 cells and T-bet levels was also analyzed."
15958,1681,"Furthermore, we explored the correlation between the expression of TMEVPG1 and the level of autoantibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and IgG in SS patients."
15959,1681,Our results indicated that the proportion of Th1 cells and the levels of TMEVPG1 and T-bet were increased in SS patients.
15960,1681,"In addition, the level of expression of TMEVPG1 was correlated with the level of SSA, ESR and IgG."
15961,1681,Our data suggest that upregulation of lncRNA TMEVPG1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of Sjgren syndrome.
15962,1682,"The aim of this study was to examine the levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in minor salivary glands, to investigate the interplay between ER stress-induced autophagy and apoptosis in human salivary gland (HSG) cells and to test the effect of ER stress-induced apoptosis on the cellular redistribution of the two major Sjgren's syndrome (SS) autoantigens Ro/Sjgren's syndrome-related antigen A (SSA) and La/Sjgren's syndrome-related antigen B (SSB)."
15963,1682,Minor salivary gland biopsies from SS patients and sicca controls were examined by immunohistochemistry for the expression of 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein/binding immunoglobulin protein (GRP78/BiP) as an indicator of unfolded protein response (UPR).
15964,1682,"HSG cells were treated with thapsigargin (TG) and cell viability, autophagy and apoptosis were assessed."
15965,1682,Immunoblot was applied to detect the conversion of LC3I to LC3II and the protein levels of GRP78/BiP and X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1).
15966,1682,Apoptosis was evaluated by a single-stranded DNA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
15967,1682,Ro/SSA and La/SSB localization was visualized using immunofluorescence.
15968,1682,GRP78/BiP was expressed by acinar and ductal epithelial cells in salivary glands of patients and sicca controls.
15969,1682,"TG treatment induced autophagy, as indicated by enhanced protein expression of LC3II."
15970,1682,"The protein levels of UPR marker XBP-1 were increased after TG treatment, while GRP78/BiP levels were decreased."
15971,1682,TG treatment resulted in induction of HSG apoptosis.
15972,1682,"Ro/SSA and La/SSB autoantigens were localized predominantly to the cytoplasm in resting cells, while they were redistributed to cell membrane and blebs in the apoptotic cells."
15973,1682,"In conclusion, ER stress is activated in minor salivary gland epithelial cells from SS patients and controls."
15974,1682,ER stress-induced apoptosis in HSG cells leads to cell surface and apoptotic blebs relocalization of Ro/SSA and La/SSB autoantigens.
15975,1683,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and causes of hepatobiliary involvement (HBI) in systemic sclerosis (SSc), to investigate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of SSc patients with HBI (SSc-HBI) and without HBI (SSc-non-HBI), and to compare both groups according to the cutaneous SSc subsets."
15976,1683,"METHODS: In all, 1572 SSc patients were collected in the RESCLE registry up to January 2015, and all hepatobiliary disturbances were recorded."
15977,1683,"We investigated the HBI-related characteristics and survival from the entire SSc cohort and according to the following cutaneous subsets: diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc), limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc), and SSc sine scleroderma (ssSSc)."
15978,1683,"RESULTS: Out of 1572, 118 (7.5%) patients had HBI."
15979,1683,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) was largely the main cause (n = 67, 4.3%), followed by autoimmune hepatitis (n = 19, 1.2%), and anti-mitochondrial negative PBC (n = 6, 0.4%)."
15980,1683,"Other causes of HBI were as follows: secondary liver diseases (n = 11, 0.7%), SSc-related HBI (n = 7, 0.4%), nodular regenerative hyperplasia (n = 3, 0.2%), liver cirrhosis (n = 3, 0.2%), and HBI of unknown origin (n = 2, 0.1%)."
15981,1683,"In multivariate analysis, HBI was independently associated to lesser risk of dcSSc (5.1% vs. 24.4%), and higher frequency of calcinosis (26% vs. 18%), left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (46% vs. 27%), sicca syndrome (51% vs. 29%), and anti-centromere antibodies (ACA, 73% vs. 44%)."
15982,1683,"According to the cutaneous subsets, HBI was associated (1) in lcSSc, to longer time from SSc onset to diagnosis (10.8  12.5 vs. 7.2  9.3 years), sicca syndrome (54% vs. 33%), and ACA (80% vs. 56%); (2) in ssSSc, to sicca syndrome (44% vs. 19%), and (3) in dcSSc, no associations were found."
15983,1683,HBI was the cause of death in 2.3% patients but the cumulative survival according to the presence or absence of HBI showed no differences.
15984,1683,CONCLUSIONS: HBI prevalence in SSc is 7.5% and dcSSc is the least involved subset.
15985,1683,PBC is the main cause of HBI.
15986,1683,Patients with SSc-HBI exhibited specific clinical and immunologic profile.
15987,1683,Survival is similar for SSc patients with HBI.
15988,1684,This study aimed to address the association between the usage of antibiotics to treat nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection and the risk of Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
15989,1684,"We identified 5,553 patients with newly diagnosed SS between 2002 and 2013 using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database and compared them with 83,295 non-SS controls matched (1:15) for age, sex, and the year of their first SS diagnosis."
15990,1684,"An increased risk of SS was found in patients receiving new macrolides (adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 1.95, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.80-2.11), fluoroquinolones (aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.41-1.64), and tetracyclines (aOR 1.69, 95% CI 1.59-1.79) compared with non-SS controls after adjusting for the Charlson comorbidity index, bronchiectasis and Helicobacter pylori infection."
15991,1684,"Notably, the association was consistent among each antibiotic in these three groups of antibiotics."
15992,1684,"In contrast to these three groups of antibiotics, the use of amikacin tended to have a negative association with incident SS (aOR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.87)."
15993,1684,"In conclusion, new macrolides, fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines were associated with a higher incidence of SS."
15994,1684,These findings indicate the need for vigilance of SS in prescribing these antibiotics and warrant further mechanistic studies.
15995,1685,The epidemiological characteristics of Sjgren syndrome (SS) are significantly varied in different countries.
15996,1685,We conducted the present study to survey the epidemiological characteristics of primary SS in China.
15997,1685,"We recruited 483 primary SS patients from 16 Chinese medical centers nationwide from January 2009 to November 2011 and assessed salivary and lacrimal gland dysfunction, organ involvement, and autoimmunity in these patients."
15998,1685,"The cohort included 456 women and 27 men (ratio, 17:1; mean age at onset, 4211 years; median age at diagnosis, 49 years; range, 41-56 years)."
15999,1685,Male patients showed a lower frequency of xerophthalmia (37.0% vs 60.7%) and a higher frequency of arthritis (40.7% vs 16.4%).
16000,1685,Young-onset patients showed a higher frequency of low C3 levels (57.7% vs 36.3%) and pancytopenia (22.2% vs 8.8%).
16001,1685,Patients with systemic involvement had a higher frequency of immunoglobulin A (IgA) (39.4% vs 22.5%) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) (12.4% vs 37.9%).
16002,1685,"Patients with pulmonary involvement had a higher parotid enlargement (21.4% vs 10.2%), purpura (12.1% vs 5.7%) and higher anti-La/SS-B (61.7% vs 41.8%), immunoglobulin G (IgG) (80.7% vs 64.6%) and IgA (48.9% vs 30.6%) levels."
16003,1685,Patients with anti-Ro/SSA antibodies had more frequent exocrine gland symptoms and some extraglandular symptoms and immunological alterations.
16004,1685,"Compared with previous studies performed in other countries, SS patients in China showed particular clinical manifestation, systemic involvement, and immunological alterations."
16005,1686,A 51-year-old woman was referred to our department for a precise examination of her neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) symptoms.
16006,1686,"She had recurrent attacks of consciousness disturbance, cerebellar ataxia and diplopia (10 years ago), paraparesis and dysesthesia in four limbs (7 years ago), and consciousness disturbance and paraparesis (4 years ago)."
16007,1686,"Neurological examination disclosed bilateral temporal pallor of the optic disc, atrophy and fasciculation of the right side of the tongue, dysesthesia in four limbs, mild motor weakness of both lower limbs, hyperreflexia in the right leg, pathological reflexes in bilateral lower limbs, and spastic bladder."
16008,1686,T2-weighted cranial MRI showed lesions in the bilateral hypothalami and the dorsal portion of the medulla oblongata on the right side.
16009,1686,T2-weighted spinal MRI revealed longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions at T2-T8.
16010,1686,A visual-evoked potential study disclosed prolonged latency of P100 bilaterally.
16011,1686,"During the examination, slight skin changes on the lower extremities indicative of scleroderma were observed, with no evidence of organ involvement."
16012,1686,Skin biopsy showed increased numbers and swelling of collagen fibers.
16013,1686,"Thus, the patient was diagnosed with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc)."
16014,1686,She also clinically manifested Sjgren syndrome.
16015,1686,"Her serum was positive for anti-nuclear, anti-centromere, and anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies."
16016,1686,Following the administration of corticosteroids (25 mg/alternative day) the patient became stable.
16017,1686,"A variety of collagen diseases or autoimmune disorders have been reported to be major complications of NMOSD; however, the coexistence of lcSSc and NMOSD is extremely rare."
16018,1686,"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a case with the coexistence of both conditions."
16019,1686,"Physicians should be aware of scleroderma in patients with NMOSD, even if patients do not complain of skin symptoms."
16020,1687,A 60-year-old woman had a history of dyspnea for 5-6 weeks.
16021,1687,The chest radiograph and computed tomography scans revealed bilateral patchy reticulonodular pattern.
16022,1687,"The patient had positive test results for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody against proteinase-3 (c-ANCA), antinuclear antibody and anti-Ro antibody."
16023,1687,"According to European Study Group on Classification Criteria for Sjgren's Syndrome, the patient was diagnosed as primary Sjgren's syndrome based on the presence of clinical features, positive findings on Schirmer's test and parotis scintigraphy."
16024,1687,Lung biopsy obtained by wedge resection showed granulomatous inflammation with extensive multinuclear giant cells involving the lung parenchyma and vascular structures.
16025,1687,There was neither upper airway nor renal involvement.
16026,1687,"Thus, the patient was simultaneously diagnosed as pulmonary-limited Wegener's granulomatosis."
16027,1687,"With this unique case, we would like to emphasize that the awareness of ANCA-associated vasculitis as a diagnostic possibility in primary Sjgren's syndrome is important during the work-up of lung lesions."
16028,1688,Labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsy is used in the classification of primary Sjgren's syndrome (PSS) and in patient stratification in clinical trials.
16029,1688,It may also function as a biomarker.
16030,1688,The acquisition of tissue and histological interpretation is variable and needs to be standardised for use in clinical trials.
16031,1688,A modified European League Against Rheumatism consensus guideline development strategy was used.
16032,1688,The steering committee of the ad hoc working group identified key outstanding points of variability in LSG acquisition and analysis.
16033,1688,A 2-day workshop was held to develop consensus where possible and identify points where further discussion/data was needed.
16034,1688,"These points were reviewed by a subgroup of experts on PSS histopathology and then circulated via an online survey to 50 stakeholder experts consisting of rheumatologists, histopathologists and oral medicine specialists, to assess level of agreement (0-10 scale) and comments."
16035,1688,Criteria for agreement were a mean score 6/10 and 75% of respondents scoring 6/10.
16036,1688,Thirty-nine (78%) experts responded and 16 points met criteria for agreement.
16037,1688,"These points are focused on tissue requirements, identification of the characteristic focal lymphocytic sialadenitis, calculation of the focus score, identification of germinal centres, assessment of the area of leucocyte infiltration, reporting standards and use of prestudy samples for clinical trials."
16038,1688,We provide standardised consensus guidance for the use of labial salivary gland histopathology in the classification of PSS and in clinical trials and identify areas where further research is required to achieve evidence-based consensus.
16039,1689,OBJECTIVE: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) has been reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).
16040,1689,"However, there have been limited reports of peripheral neuropathy as a complication of neuromyelitis optica (NMO)."
16041,1689,"In this paper, we showed the characteristics and differences between peripheral neuropathy as a complication of MS and NMO."
16042,1689,METHOD: We analyzed a series of 58 MS and 28 NMO patients and evaluated nerve conduction studies (NCS) in 21 MS and 5 NMO patients.
16043,1689,RESULTS: Six of the 58 MS and 3 of the 28 NMO patients revealed abnormal NCS findings.
16044,1689,Three (5.2%) of the 58 MS patients fulfilled the criteria for CIDP.
16045,1689,"One (3.6%) of the 28 NMO patients showed peripheral neuropathy at the same time of NMO relapse, although CIDP was not seen in NMO."
16046,1689,The other 5 (3 MS and 2 NMO) patients were complicated with neuropathy caused by concomitant diabetes mellitus and Sjgren's syndrome.
16047,1689,"CONCLUSION: Frequency of abnormal NCS findings might exhibit no significant difference between MS and NMO, although the cause and pathophysiology of peripheral neuropathy were different in MS and in NMO."
16048,1689,There might be a group of NMO who were affected simultaneously in the central and peripheral nervous tissues.
16049,1690,OBJECTIVE: Salivary gland secretion is dependent on cholinergic stimulation via autonomic nerves and calcium signalling in acinar cells.
16050,1690,Secretory dysfunction associated with SS may be partly caused by the damaging effects of increased glandular concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) derived from up-regulation of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) that accompanies glandular inflammation.
16051,1690,The present study examines the effects of increased iNOS expression on salivary gland secretory function.
16052,1690,"METHODS: The inflammogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was introduced intraductally into rat submandibular glands, and glandular responsiveness to cholinergic stimulation was determined."
16053,1690,"RESULTS: LPS provoked a rapid, long-lasting inflammation, increasing gland weight (by almost 20%) and inflammatory cell infiltration at 3 and 24 h. Immunoblotting of glandular homogenates indicated that iNOS expression was increased approximately 4-fold, and immunohistochemistry of frozen tissue sections showed increased iNOS expression in acinar cells."
16054,1690,Salivary secretion from inflamed glands was significantly increased in response to low doses of methacholine and accompanied by increased acinar cell calcium signalling in vitro.
16055,1690,"Prior administration of the iNOS inhibitors, aminoguanidine or L-NIL [L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine dihydrochloride] abolished increased secretion and acinar cell calcium signalling."
16056,1690,CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulation of glandular iNOS expression can increase cholinergically evoked salivary secretion and appears to offset any secretory hypofunction linked with glandular inflammation.
16057,1690,It seems unlikely that increased glandular levels of NO are responsible for the secretory hypofunction that accompanies SS.
16058,1691,OBJECTIVES: The objective of this report is to investigate the feasibility of collecting patient-reported outcomes (PROs) via e-questionnaires delivered to patients with chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs).
16059,1691,"METHODS: Consecutive outpatients with a confirmed diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, primary Sjgren's syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease were followed at two medical departments."
16060,1691,"Patients received monthly e-mails containing the SF36, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and an analogue symptom scale over a six-month period."
16061,1691,"Participation rate, socio-demographic characteristics and patients' satisfaction were analysed."
16062,1691,RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were included (79% female; mean age: 4212 years).
16063,1691,Eighty-two per cent of questionnaires were returned.
16064,1691,"The monthly participation rate ranged from 89% to 77%, with a six-month attrition rate of 13%."
16065,1691,The mean completion rate of questionnaires was 98%.
16066,1691,"Factors significantly associated with increased answer rate were: married/couple status, greater number of children at home and previous participation in online surveys."
16067,1691,The main reasons for non-response were: 'too busy to participate' (35%) and 'away from home Internet access' (31%).
16068,1691,"Overall, 68% of the participants found the study convenient and 96% agreed to continue at a monthly or bimonthly frequency."
16069,1691,CONCLUSION: Online home self-assessment of PROs was feasible in the setting of CIDs.
16070,1691,Patients were satisfied and willing to continue the survey.
16071,1691,The Internet allows immediate and sophisticated presentation of PROs to clinicians.
16072,1691,Future studies are warranted to determine how PRO monitoring may contribute to routine care in CIDs and other diseases.
16073,1692,BACKGROUND: A rapid and sensitive time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TRFIA) based on the biotin-streptavidin amplification system was developed for the determination of anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP).
16074,1692,"METHODS: Europium-labeled streptavidin derivatives combined with europium and anhydride of diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid were used to label streptavidin, biotin was coupled with rabbit anti-human IgG to form a biotin-anti-human IgG bridge between streptavidin-europium and the anti-CCP antibody in the immunoassay."
16075,1692,The anti-CCP assay was carried out by measuring the fluorescence of Eu(3+) -streptavidin at 615 nm.
16076,1692,"RESULTS: The presented method produced a wide linear range from 0.58 to 9,463 U/ml, while it was only 591.4-18.48 U/ml when using an ELISA kit, and featured a detection limit up to 0.5 U/ml for anti-CCP."
16077,1692,The values determined by the biotin-streptavidin-TRFIA and ELISA correlated well (R(2) = 0.8927).
16078,1692,The method was applied to determine anti-CCP in serum samples with satisfied recoveries of 96.45-104.63%.
16079,1692,CONCLUSION: The assay results obtained by the present method showed that biotin-streptavidin-amplified TRFIA improve the traditional ELISA kit for anti-CCP detection.
16080,1692,"Therefore, it offers a better alternative immunoassay in rheumatoid arthritis management."
16081,1693,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterised by breach of self-tolerance towards nuclear antigens resulting in high affinity circulating autoantibodies.
16082,1693,"Although peripheral B cell disturbances have been described in SS, with predominance of nave and reduction of memory B cells, the stage at which errors in B cell tolerance checkpoints accumulate in SS is unknown."
16083,1693,Here we determined the frequency of self- and poly-reactive B cells in the circulating nave and memory compartment of SS patients.
16084,1693,"Single CD27-IgD+ nave, CD27+IgD+ memory unswitched and CD27+IgD- memory switched B cells were sorted by FACS from the peripheral blood of 7 SS patients."
16085,1693,"To detect the frequency of polyreactive and autoreactive clones, paired Ig VH and VL genes were amplified, cloned and expressed as recombinant monoclonal antibodies (rmAbs) displaying identical specificity of the original B cells."
16086,1693,IgVH and VL gene usage and immunoreactivity of SS rmAbs were compared with those obtained from healthy donors (HD).
16087,1693,"From a total of 353 VH and 293 VL individual sequences, we obtained 114 rmAbs from circulating nave (n = 66) and memory (n = 48) B cells of SS patients."
16088,1693,Analysis of the Ig V gene repertoire did not show significant differences in SS vs. HD B cells.
16089,1693,"In SS patients, circulating nave B cells (with germline VH and VL genes) displayed a significant accumulation of clones autoreactive against Hep-2 cells compared to HD (43.1% vs. 25%)."
16090,1693,"Moreover, we demonstrated a progressive increase in the frequency of circulating anti-nuclear nave (9.3%), memory unswitched (22.2%) and memory switched (27.3%) B cells in SS patients."
16091,1693,"Overall, these data provide novel evidence supporting the existence of both early and late defects in B cell tolerance checkpoints in patients with SS resulting in the accumulation of autoreactive nave and memory B cells."
16092,1694,OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of the use of containers with an adapted sterilizing filter on the contamination of autologous serum eyedrops.
16093,1694,"DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive, comparative, and randomized study."
16094,1694,PARTICIPANTS: Thirty patients with Sjgren syndrome.
16095,1694,"METHODS: One hundred seventy-six autologous serum containers used in home therapy were studied; 48 of them included an adapted filter (Hyabak; Thea, Clermont-Ferrand, France), and the other 128 were conventional containers."
16096,1694,"Containers equipped with a filter were tested at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of use, whereas conventional containers were studied after 7 days of use."
16097,1694,"In addition, testing for contamination was carried out in 14 conventional containers used during in-patient therapy every week for 4 weeks."
16098,1694,"In all cases, the preparation of the autologous serum was similar."
16099,1694,"Blood agar and chocolate agar were used as regular culture media for the microbiologic studies, whereas Sabouraud agar with chloramphenicol was the medium for fungal studies."
16100,1694,MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Microbiologic contamination of containers with autologous serum eyedrops.
16101,1694,"RESULTS: Only one of the containers with an adapted sterilizing filter (2.1%) became contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis after 1 month of treatment, whereas the contamination rate among conventional containers reached 28.9% after 7 days of treatment."
16102,1694,The most frequent germs found in the samples were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (48.6%).
16103,1694,"With regard the containers used in the in-patient setting, 2 (14.3%) became contaminated after 2 weeks, 5 (35.7%) became contaminated after 3 weeks, and 5 (50%) became contaminated after 4 weeks, leaving 7 (50%) that did not become contaminated after 1 month of treatment."
16104,1694,"CONCLUSIONS: Using containers with an adapted filter significantly reduces the contamination rates in autologous serum eyedrops, thus extending the use of such container by the patients for up to 4 weeks with virtually no contamination risks."
16105,1695,OBJECTIVES: To report a case in which hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts were successfully used for the treatment of dry eye disease in a contact lens (CLs) wearer for more than 25 years.
16106,1695,METHODS: Review of clinical findings in a female CL wearer with dry eye spanning more than 30 years.
16107,1695,The patient was diagnosed with the Sjgren syndrome and demonstrated inadequate lacrimation as assessed by Schirmer testing.
16108,1695,Slitlamp examination demonstrated bilateral corneal stippling with fluorescein and signs of superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.
16109,1695,"RESULTS: Initially, the patient's symptoms improved with infrequent use of artificial tears."
16110,1695,"As the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease worsened, the patient initiated therapy with once-daily hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts."
16111,1695,"Punctal plugs and updating to increasingly oxygen-permeable soft CLs, in combination with continued use of the inserts, largely controlled the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease during a 25-year period."
16112,1695,Simultaneous use of the hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts and CLs was well tolerated without any significant side effects or changes in visual acuity.
16113,1695,CONCLUSIONS: Dry eye is a chronic disease often requiring long-term management.
16114,1695,"In this case, daily use of hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts effectively treated autoimmune dry eye, providing symptomatic relief, and resulted in improved objective measures of disease severity across several decades."
16115,1695,Such an experience is consistent with the available evidence-based data for hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts and supports their use in clinical practice for the treatment of moderate-to-severe dry eye disease.
16116,1696,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) who have autoimmune cytopenia.
16117,1696,"METHODS: We analyzed 113 participants from the Korean Initiative of Primary Sjgren Syndrome, a prospective pSS cohort."
16118,1696,"Autoimmune cytopenia was defined as autoimmune origin neutropenia, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia without vitamin or iron deficiency, or drug-induced cytopenia."
16119,1696,"To identify the association between autoimmune cytopenia and the clinical characteristics of pSS, extraglandular manifestations were analyzed according to the European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI) definition."
16120,1696,"Xerophthalmia was assessed with the Ocular Surface Disease Index, Schirmer I test, ocular stain score (OSS), and tear film breakup time."
16121,1696,RESULTS: The median total ESSDAI score was 2 (interquartile range 1-6).
16122,1696,About a quarter of patients had no systemic activity.
16123,1696,Autoimmune cytopenia was observed in 23.9% of patients (n = 27).
16124,1696,"Moderate biological features were more frequently observed in patients with autoimmune cytopenia than in patients without [10 (37%) and 11 (12.8%), respectively, p = 0.016]."
16125,1696,"Articular involvement was exhibited in 1 patient with autoimmune cytopenia, but in 23 patients (27.4%) without autoimmune cytopenia (p = 0.013)."
16126,1696,Higher OSS (p = 0.002) and lower mean Schirmer I test (p = 0.029) were observed in patients with autoimmune cytopenia than in those without.
16127,1696,"Neutrophils and lymphocytes negatively correlated with OSS ( = -0.204, p = 0.041 and  = -0.230, p = 0.020, respectively)."
16128,1696,CONCLUSION: Autoimmune cytopenia is closely associated with severe ocular surface damage in pSS.
16129,1696,"Therefore, assessment of xerophthalmia by ophthalmologists may be mandatory, particularly in patients with pSS with cytopenia, even if patients do not complain of eye dryness."
16130,1697,"PURPOSE: Diminished salivary flow, or dry mouth impacts the oral health of many older adults, dentate and edentulous."
16131,1697,As a result typical oral conditions can prove more challenging to both the patient's comfort and home care and the treatment selected by the clinician.
16132,1697,"This paper will review issues of dry mouth from a clinical and symptomatic perspective and will include the condition's causes, treatment and prevention."
16133,1697,"STUDY SELECTION: We performed a review of PubMed using the words: older adults, dry mouth, xerostomia, radiation-induced xerostomia, and salivary gland hypofunction."
16134,1697,We selected 90 articles with a clinical application perspective.
16135,1697,"RESULTS: When it comes to treatment of dry mouth conditions, either objective or subjective, there are no easy answers as to the best course of action for a specific individual."
16136,1697,"While most of the cited studies have examined the most difficult cases of dry mouth (e.g., Sjgren's syndrome, and that seen during and post head and neck cancer treatments), there are many older adults who demonstrate dry mouth from the use of multiple medications."
16137,1697,"This paper presents a summary of the etiology, diagnosis, prevention, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of dry mouth (salivary hypofunction and xerostomia in older adults)."
16138,1697,CONCLUSIONS: It is important to understand the causes of dry mouth and to educate our patients.
16139,1697,"Starting a prevention program as early as possible considering the most practical, cost effective and efficient treatments with the best risk-benefit ratio will help to diminish dry mouth symptoms and sequelae."
16140,1698,BACKGROUND: Collection and testing of individual serum samples are often used in research to gain knowledge about e.g.
16141,1698,the humoral response against bacteria or virus.
16142,1698,This is a valid but time-consuming method and might be a waste of valuable serum samples for inefficient research.
16143,1698,"So far, no study has considered using serum pools as a quick and efficient screening method to confirm or deny hypotheses."
16144,1698,"METHODS: We created serum pools from four different patient groups (systemic lupus erythematosus n=85, rheumatoid arthritis n=77, Sjgren's syndrome n=91, systemic sclerosis n=66) and one healthy control group (n=67)."
16145,1698,"Each serum pool was analyzed using three well-known immunoassays: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), line blot, and immunofluorescence microscopy (anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) screening)."
16146,1698,"The presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EA/D-, EBNA-1-, VCA p23-, and gp350-directed antibodies was used to validate serum pools as an efficient tool for further investigations by comparison to previous findings in this area."
16147,1698,"RESULTS: The presence of EBV EA/D-, EBNA-1-, VCA p23-, and gp350-directed antibodies in each pool was consistent within the obtained ELISA and line blot results, as increased titers of IgG against the four antigens were found in all patient serum pools and also in individual sera regarding gp350."
16148,1698,These results correspond to previous findings on individual samples from patients with these diseases.
16149,1698,"The presence of ANAs was observed in all four patient serum pools and not in the HC pool by both line blots and immunofluorescence microscopy, which corresponds with the expectations and further corroborate the application of serum pools for screenings."
16150,1698,"CONCLUSION: We developed and validated the use of serum pools that reliably and rapidly can confirm or deny hypotheses, which enables a more efficient research concentrating on the most evident factors."
16151,1699,AIM: To explore the correlativity between HLA-DQ allele and primary Sjogren's syndrome(pSS) of the Han nationality in Shanxi province and to understand the pathogenesis of pSS at the gene level.
16152,1699,"METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) technique was used to determine the alleles of HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 of pSS patients and healthy populations, and the difference in their HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 allelic frequencies were analyzed by using chi-square test and Fisher's exact test."
16153,1699,"RESULTS: (1) The gene frequency of HLA-DQA1*0501 in pSS patients was significantly higher than that in healthy controls(22.0% vs 12.0%, x(2);=7.087, P<0.05, RR=2.068)."
16154,1699,"(2)The gene frequency of HLA-DQA1*0301/2 in pSS patients was significantly lower than that in controls(13.0% vs 24.5%, x(2);=8.681, P<0.05, RR=0.460)."
16155,1699,"(3) The gene frequency of HLA-DQB1*0201 in pSS patients was significantly higher than that in controls(28.5% vs 18.5%, x(2);=5.563, P<0.05, RR=1.756)."
16156,1699,"CONCLUSION: In Han nationality of Shanxi province, HLA-DQA1*0501 and HLA-DQB1*0201 alleles probably are susceptible genes of pSS, while HLA-DQA1*0301/2 allele probably is a protective gene of pSS."
16157,1700,INTRODUCTION: We report an unusual case of facial pain and swelling caused by compression of the facial and vestibulocochlear cranial nerves due to the tortuous course of a branch of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.
16158,1700,"Although anterior inferior cerebellar artery compression has been well documented in the literature, compression caused by the posterior inferior cerebellar artery is rare."
16159,1700,"This case provided a diagnostic dilemma, requiring expertise from a number of specialties, and proved to be a learning point to clinicians from a variety of backgrounds."
16160,1700,We describe the case in detail and discuss the differential diagnoses.
16161,1700,"CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old Caucasian woman with a background of mild connective tissue disease presented to our rheumatologist with intermittent left-sided facial pain and swelling, accompanied by hearing loss in her left ear."
16162,1700,An autoimmune screen was negative and a Schirmer's test was normal.
16163,1700,Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 6mm/h (normal range: 1 to 20mm/h) and her immunoglobulin G and A levels were mildly elevated.
16164,1700,"A vascular loop protocol magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a loop of her posterior inferior cerebellar artery taking a long course around the seventh and eighth cranial nerves into the meatus and back, resulting in compression of her seventh and eighth cranial nerves."
16165,1700,"Our patient underwent microvascular decompression, after which her symptoms completely resolved."
16166,1700,"CONCLUSION: Hemifacial spasm is characterized by unilateral clonic twitching, although our patient presented with more unusual symptoms of pain and swelling."
16167,1700,Onset of symptoms is mostly in middle age and women are more commonly affected.
16168,1700,"Differential diagnoses include trigeminal neuralgia, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, salivary gland pathology and migrainous headache."
16169,1700,Botulinum toxin injection is recognized as an effective treatment option for primary hemifacial spasm.
16170,1700,Microvascular decompression is a relatively safe procedure with a high success rate.
16171,1700,"Although a rare pathology, posterior inferior cerebellar artery compression causing facial pain, swelling and hearing loss should be considered as a differential diagnosis in similar cases."
16172,1701,BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is an intractable disease in which clinical symptoms of intestinal obstruction appear without mechanical cause.
16173,1701,"No clear diagnostic criteria have been established; therefore, we proposed diagnostic criteria to facilitate the diagnosis of this rare disease and aim to evaluate their usefulness and validity."
16174,1701,MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 378 institutions belonging to the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology between December 2009 and February 2010.
16175,1701,We summarized the returned data and performed a statistical analysis.
16176,1701,"RESULTS: A total of 160 cases were included, and 141 cases (88.1%) fulfilled the criterion of disease duration of >6 months, 157 cases (98.1%) the criterion of the clinical symptoms of abdominal pain and/or bloating and 154 cases (96.2%) fulfilled the criterion of imaging findings."
16177,1701,"Eventually, 138 cases (86.3%) fulfilled all criteria."
16178,1701,"CONCLUSIONS: The proposed diagnostic criteria were useful, with a high sensitivity of 86.3% for Japanese patients."
16179,1701,Improved recognition of CIPO and practical use of the criteria are desired.
16180,1701,The criteria should be appropriately modified by additional researchers to make them more practical and internationally applicable.
16181,1702,IL-15 is a key regulatory cytokine that shares many biological properties with IL-2.
16182,1702,"Recently, it has been shown that IL-15 could be up-regulated in T cell-mediated inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases."
16183,1702,"However, the role and expression of IL-15 in the inflammatory autoimmune disease Sjgren's syndrome (SS) has not been investigated."
16184,1702,In the present study we evaluated the expression of IL-15 mRNA and protein in minor salivary gland (MSG) biopsy specimens and in human salivary gland epithelial cell (SGEC) cultures obtained from patients with primary SS (pSS) and compared their expression with that seen in normal healthy control subjects.
16185,1702,IL-15 gene and protein analysis revealed that SGEC are able to produce IL-15.
16186,1702,Results obtained demonstrated that the number of IL-15(+) cultured SGEC was significantly higher in cells derived from patients with pSS in comparison with SGEC from healthy subjects; similar results were obtained for IL-15 immunoreactivity by using immunohistochemistry that revealed a strong expression both in acinar and in ductal cells from pSS MSG.
16187,1702,These studies could provide a rational basis to determine whether IL-15 could be a good candidate for anti-cytokine therapy in chronic inflammatory pSS diseases.
16188,1703,Extrahepatic manifestations (EHMs) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can affect a variety of organ systems with significant morbidity and mortality.
16189,1703,"Some of the most frequently reported EHM of HCV infection, involve the oral region predominantly or exclusively."
16190,1703,"Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory condition that is potentially malignant and represents cell-mediated reaction to a variety of extrinsic antigens, altered self-antigens, or super antigens."
16191,1703,Robust epidemiological evidence support the link between OLP and HCV.
16192,1703,"As the virus may replicate in the oral mucosa and attract HCV-specific T lymphocytes, HCV may be implicated in OLP pathogenesis."
16193,1703,"Sjgren syndrome (SjS) is an autoimmune exocrinopathy, characterized by dryness of the mouth and eyes and a multitude of other systemic signs and symptoms."
16194,1703,SjS patients have also an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
16195,1703,Patients with chronic hepatitis C do frequently have histological signs of Sjgren-like sialadenitis with mild or even absent clinical symptoms.
16196,1703,"However, it is still unclear if HCV may cause a disease mimicking SjS or it is directly responsible for the development of SjS in a specific subset of patients."
16197,1703,Oral squamous cell carcinoma is the most common oral malignant tumour and at least in some part of the world could be linked to HCV.
16198,1704,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose rituximab in the treatment of hematologic abnormalities in patients with connective tissue disease.
16199,1704,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 13patients with connective tissue disease who did not respond to prednisolone and multiple immunosuppressive agents, or their disease recurred after treatment, were given 100mg of rituximab only combined with prednisolone once a week for 4weeks."
16200,1704,"Then, the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions were respectively observed in the 13patients."
16201,1704,"RESULTS: Rituximab showed good and rapid efficacy in the treatment of refractory thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia caused by systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjgren's syndrome, and mixed connective tissue disease."
16202,1704,Only 1patient had urinary tract infection.
16203,1704,"During 24-month follow-up, disease recurred in 7patients who still responded to azathioprine/Tripterygium wilfordii."
16204,1704,CONCLUSION: Low-dose rituximab has good efficacy and safety in the treatment of hematologic abnormalities in patients with connective tissue disease.
16205,1705,"BAFF (B-cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family), a pivotal cytokine for B-cell activation, is overexpressed by salivary gland (SG) epithelial cells in primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS)."
16206,1705,"BAFF, a physiological inhibitor of BAFF, is a minor alternative splice variant of BAFF."
16207,1705,A U7 RNA was reengineered to deliver antisense sequences targeting BAFF splice regions.
16208,1705,"A major decrease of BAFF messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein secretion, concomitantly with the increase of BAFF mRNA, was observed in vitro."
16209,1705,"In vivo, SG retrograd instillation of nonobese diabetic mice by the modified U7 cloned into an adeno-associated virus vector significantly decreased BAFF protein expression and lymphocytic infiltrates and improved salivary flow."
16210,1705,This study offers a rationale for localized therapeutic BAFF inhibition in pSS and represents a proof of concept of the interest of exon skipping in autoimmune diseases.
16211,1706,Limited data are available regarding the intracellular responses to different cytokines in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
16212,1706,We studied the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation profile in response to cytokine stimulations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from pSS patients by multicolor flow cytometry.
16213,1706,"The expression of the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), and interferon (IFN)- target genes in PBMCs was studied using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)."
16214,1706,"The induction of STAT1 phosphorylation in response to stimulation with IFN-, IFN- or interleukin (IL)-6 was significantly increased in B cells and monocytes from pSS patients."
16215,1706,"Accordingly, the STAT1-mediated gene responses were significantly enhanced in PBMCs from pSS patients."
16216,1706,"Finally, the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA was increased in pSS patients."
16217,1706,"The results indicate increased sensitivity of immune cells from pSS patients to STAT1-activating signals, and may partly explain the IFN signature observed in pSS."
16218,1707,"BACKGROUND: Congenital heart block affects 2% of all mothers with anti-Ro/La antibodies, can cause heart failure in utero, and has a 20% mortality rate in the first 3 years of life."
16219,1707,Maternal fluorinated steroids to prevent or reverse congenital heart block can cause pregnancy complications.
16220,1707,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been given with maternal steroids to prevent the recurrence of congenital heart block, although its efficacy is unproven."
16221,1707,CASE: We report the use of IVIG to prevent progression of 2:1 congenital heart block with intermittent complete heart block.
16222,1707,"After two maternal infusions of IVIG (0.4 g/kg) at 31 weeks of gestation, the fetal heart rate reverted to long periods of sinus rhythm, which was sustained until postnatal life."
16223,1707,CONCLUSION: Our case supports investigating IVIG in the prevention or treatment of this life-threatening condition.
16224,1708,"We investigated the role of Smad4, a signaling molecule of the TGF-beta pathway, in T cells on the pathology of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, an animal model of SS."
16225,1708,"T cell-specific Smad4-deleted (Smad4fl/fl,CD4-Cre; Smad4 tKO) NOD mice had accelerated development of SS compared with wild-type (Smad4+/+,CD4-Cre; WT) NOD mice, including increased lymphocyte infiltration into exocrine glands, decreased tear and saliva production, and increased levels of autoantibodies at 12 weeks of age."
16226,1708,"Activated/memory T cells and cytokine (IFN-, IL-17)-producing T cells were increased in Smad4 tKO NOD mice, however the proportion and function of regulatory T (Treg) cells were not different between Smad4 tKO and WT NOD mice."
16227,1708,Effector T (Teff) cells from Smad4 tKO NOD mice were less sensitive than WT Teff cells to suppression by Treg cells.
16228,1708,"Th17 differentiation capability of Teff cells was similar between Smad4 tKO and WT NOD mice, but IL-17 expression was increased under inducible Treg skewing conditions in T cells from Smad4 tKO NOD mice."
16229,1708,"Our results demonstrate that disruption of the Smad4 pathway in T cells of NOD mice increases Teff cell activation resulting in upregulation of Th17 cells, indicating that Smad4 in T cells has a protective role in the development of SS in NOD mice."
16230,1709,The incidence of Sjgren syndrome (SS) in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients is high.
16231,1709,"The influence of SS on the clinical outcomes of PBC patients, however, remains unclear."
16232,1709,Our study retrospectively collected data on PBC-only patients and PBC patients with concomitant SS (PBC-SS) to compare the clinical differences of long-term outcomes between them.A total of 183 patients were diagnosed with PBC from January 1999 to December 2014 at our hospital.
16233,1709,"Of these, the authors excluded patients with diabetes, hypertension, advanced liver cirrhosis at initial diagnosis of PBC (Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification score of 7) and other liver diseases (ie, alcoholic liver disease, alpha-antitrypsin deficiency, viral hepatitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis), and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis."
16234,1709,"Of the remaining 125 patients, 77 (61.6%) were PBC-only and 48 (38.4%) were PBC-SS patients.The mean follow-up duration was 8.76 years."
16235,1709,"During the observation period, the incidence of interstitial lung disease was higher in the PBC-SS group than in the PBC-only group (P=0.005)."
16236,1709,The occurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was significantly different in PBC-SS patients than in PBC-only patients (P=0.002).
16237,1709,The overall survival was lower in PBC-SS patients than in PBC-only patients (P=0.033).
16238,1709,"Although the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, end-stage renal disease, variceal bleeding, and hypothyroidism were all higher in the PBC-SS group than in the PBC-only group, the differences were not significant.Our study suggests that PBC-SS patients have a higher risk of developing interstitial lung disease and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and have a poor prognosis."
16239,1709,Aggressive surveillance of thyroid and pulmonary functions should therefore be performed in these patients.
16240,1710,Long-lived secreted autoantibody responses in systemic autoimmunity are generally regarded to be polyclonal and to express a diverse B-cell repertoire.
16241,1710,"Here, we have used a proteomic approach based on de novo sequencing to determine the clonality and V region structures of human autoantibodies directed against a prototypic systemic autoantigen, Ro52 (TRIM21)."
16242,1710,"Remarkably, anti-Ro52 autoantibodies from patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis or polymyositis were restricted to two IgG1 kappa clonotypes that migrated as a single species on isoelectric focusing; shared a common light chain paired with one of two closely-related heavy chains; and were public in unrelated patients."
16243,1710,Targeted mass spectrometry using these uniquely mutated V region peptides as surrogates detected anti-Ro52 autoantibodies in human sera with high sensitivity and specificity compared with traditional ELISA.
16244,1710,Mass spectrometry-based detection of specific autoantibody motifs provides a powerful new tool for analysis of humoral autoimmunity.
16245,1711,INTRODUCTION: Primary Sjogren's Syndrome (pSS) with Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis(HPP) whether an association or a different clinical subset needs review.
16246,1711,"METHODS: Cross-sectional retrospective study of subjects of Primary Sjogren's Syndrome with Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis(HPP) identified from database maintained at Centre For Rheumatic Diseases, Pune since 1996 with records of over 50000 patients."
16247,1711,The diagnosis was clinical.
16248,1711,Clinical and investigations data was extracted pertaining to initial examination and follow up.
16249,1711,"Standard investigations & ELISA, immunoblot and nephelometry to assay autoantibodies (AAb) were done."
16250,1711,RESULTS: 16 patients of Primary Sjogren's Syndrome (pSS) with Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis (HPP) were identified in the period 2000-2014.
16251,1711,Presenting feature was HPP in 86% with Dry eye (4%) and Arthralgias (10%) in remaining.
16252,1711,Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis was identified in all.
16253,1711,All were females with average age of 26 years.
16254,1711,Symptomatic ocular sicca noted in 60% & Oral sicca in 50% patients.
16255,1711,"Other features - Arthralgias (91%), arthritis (42%), mucositis (38%), Neuropathy (30%), skin rash (20%) cytopenias (19%), Erosive arthritis (10%), interstitial lung disease (10%) and Raynaud Phenomenon (10%)."
16256,1711,100% were positive for ANA.
16257,1711,"SSA was positive in 100%, SSB in 50% of patients & Rheumatoid Factor in 70 %."
16258,1711,Hypothyroidism was associated in 70% patients.
16259,1711,CONCLUSION: We present a large series of Primary Sjogren's Syndrome with Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis(HPP) from India.
16260,1711,"Prominent features of female dominance, younger age of onset and SSA positivity noted in this cohort of patients on Routine clinical and serology phenotype suggests existence of a distinct subset."
16261,1711,HPP was presenting feature in majority.
16262,1712,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a common chronic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands, mainly salivary and lacrimal, resulting in oral and ocular dryness, although virtually any organ system can be affected."
16263,1712,SS-related systemic manifestations are classified as either related to the presence of periepithelial infiltrates in exocrine and parenchymal organs or resulting from immunocomplex deposition due to B cell hyperactivity with increased risk for B cell lymphoma development.
16264,1712,"Activation of both innate and adaptive immune pathways contributes to disease pathogenesis, with prominent interferon (IFN) signatures identified in both peripheral blood and affected salivary gland tissues."
16265,1712,"Recently, LINE-1 genomic repeat elements have been proposed as potential triggers of type I IFN pathway activation in SS through activation of Toll-like receptor-dependent and -independent pathways."
16266,1712,"In view of the increasingly appreciated variability of SS, elucidation of distinct operating pathways in relation to diverse clinical phenotypes and selection of the optimal therapeutic intervention remain major challenges."
16267,1712,"Inhibition of cathepsin S molecules, blockade of costimulation through administration of abatacept and inhibitors of B7-related molecules and CD40, blockade of B cell function and B cell survival factors, and disruption of the formation of ectopic germinal centers are considered the main therapeutic targets."
16268,1712,Well-controlled multicenter clinical trials are ongoing and data are awaited.
16269,1713,"BACKGROUND: Among the complex of HTLV-associated diseases, Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is one of the most controversial."
16270,1713,"This work aims to detect morphological and inflammatory alterations, including clues of the presence of HTLV-1, in minor salivary glands of patients with dryness symptoms."
16271,1713,METHODS: We have assessed HTLV-1-seropositive patients (HTLV-1 group) and patients with SS (SS group).
16272,1713,"We used formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded minor salivary gland tissue to evaluate the morphological aspects and, by means of immunohistochemistry, the presence of Tax protein, CD4, CD8 and CD20 cells."
16273,1713,"Additionally, viral particles and proviral load were analysed by PCR."
16274,1713,RESULTS: The HTLV-1 group had the highest prevalence of non-specific chronic sialadenitis (85.71%; P=0.017) and greater amount of T CD8(+) cells.
16275,1713,"In the SS group, focal lymphocytic sialadenitis (80%; P=0.017) prevailed, with a greater amount of B CD20(+) ."
16276,1713,Both immunohistochemistry and PCR identified the Tax protein and its gene in the salivary glands of both groups and in similar proportions.
16277,1713,"CONCLUSION: The results indicate that HTLV-1-seropositive patients have different patterns of morphological/inflammatory alterations, suggesting a likely difference in the process of immune activation."
16278,1714,The risk of developing lymphoma in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is 44 times higher than in the normal population with the most common lymphomas derived from marginal zone B (MZB) cells.
16279,1714,"Current understanding of the role of MZB cells in SS is primarily based on salivary gland pathology, while their contextual association with lacrimal glands and ocular manifestations largely remains unknown."
16280,1714,We examined this possibility using a SS mouse model (thrombospondin-1 deficient (TSP1(-/-))) with well-characterized ocular disease.
16281,1714,"We determined the frequency, localization, and cytokine profiles of MZB cells and their association with an antibody response in TSP1(-/-) mice treated with a TSP-derived peptide."
16282,1714,A significantly increased frequency of MZB cells was detected in the spleens and lacrimal glands of TSP1(-/-) mice in comparison to wild-type tissues as detected by immunostaining.
16283,1714,An altered cytokine profile of TSP1(-/-) MZB cells was supportive of T helper 17 (Th17)-related pathogenesis.
16284,1714,A significantly reduced antibody response and the splenic MZB compartment against an eye-derived antigen were noted in TSP-derived peptide-treated mice.
16285,1714,These changes correspond with the previously reported ability of the peptide to ameliorate SS-related ocular manifestations.
16286,1714,"Collectively, our results demonstrate dysregulation of MZB cells in TSP1(-/-) mice and highlight their role in the context of SS-related chronic ocular surface disease."
16287,1715,PURPOSE: Sialendoscopy of the major salivary glands could alleviate the oral symptoms of Sjgren syndrome (SS) and restore salivary function.
16288,1715,"The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of sialendoscopy of the major salivary glands on salivary flow, saliva composition, and mouthfeel in patients with SS and to collect data for sample size analysis for a larger clinical trial."
16289,1715,MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients diagnosed with SS were randomly assigned to a nonintervention control group or a sialendoscopy group.
16290,1715,"Unstimulated whole saliva flow, stimulated whole saliva flow, Clinical Oral Dryness Score, Xerostomia Inventory score, and EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index score were obtained 1week before (T0), 1week after (T2), and 8weeks after (T3) sialendoscopy."
16291,1715,"Unstimulated whole saliva was analyzed for amylase concentration, activity, and mucin 5B concentration."
16292,1715,Amylase and mucin 5B output were calculated.
16293,1715,"RESULTS: In the sialendoscopy group, unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva flows were numerically higher at T2 and T3 compared with T0."
16294,1715,Xerostomia Inventory score was significantly lower in the sialendoscopy group at T2 compared with T0 (P= .03).
16295,1715,Unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva flows were higher in the sialendoscopy group compared with the control group at T2 and T3 (not meaningful).
16296,1715,Significant differences were found between groups for the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index score at T2(P=.03) and T3 (P= .001).
16297,1715,"Xerostomia Inventory score and Clinical Oral Dryness Score in the sialendoscopy group were lower compared with the control group at T2 (P= .02) and at T3 (P= .04), indicating less oral dryness."
16298,1715,"CONCLUSION: This pilot study indicates a positive effect of sialendoscopy on some parameters, but it cannot yet be concluded that it has a positive effect on salivary flow in patients with SS."
16299,1715,These preliminary results need to be verified in a randomized controlled trial with a larger sample and longer follow-up period.
16300,1716,Inflammation of the eye is often times seen in association with systemic inflammatory diseases.
16301,1716,Understanding the various forms of ocular involvement in these conditions is important as untreated ophthalmic involvement can lead to severe vision loss.
16302,1716,"In addition to providing a basic framework for diagnosis and treatment, this review will highlight the ocular manifestations of the following systemic inflammatory conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis, Sjgren's syndrome, polyarteritisnodosa, primary antiphospholipid syndrome, Behet's syndrome, Kawasaki disease, Cogan's syndrome and relapsing polychondritis."
16303,1717,"OBJECTIVES: Autoimmune diseases do not impair fertility, and women with autoimmune diseases who become pregnant are likely to experience more complicated pregnancies than are women without the disease."
16304,1717,Pregnancies complicated by these disorders have a high clinical impact on both the pregnancy and the disease.
16305,1717,"The effect of autoimmune disease on pregnancy differs according to the type of maternal disease, disease activity, severity of organ damage, antibody profile, and drug treatment."
16306,1717,Sjgren syndrome is an autoimmune disease with a high prevalence of anti-SS-A (anti-Ro) and anti-SS-B (anti-La) antibodies.
16307,1717,Anti-SS-A antibodies are associated with congenital heart block.
16308,1717,Data on pregnancy outcomes in primary Sjgren syndrome are scarce.
16309,1717,METHODS: We performed a review of the literature regarding pregnancy outcomes in women with Sjgren syndrome.
16310,1717,RESULTS: Women with Sjgren syndrome are likely to experience more complications during pregnancy than women without an autoimmune disease.
16311,1717,Studies show a high incidence of poor fetal outcomes for these patients.
16312,1717,CONCLUSION: Women with Sjgren syndrome require prenatal counseling explaining the risks involved and the need to control the disease well before conception.
16313,1717,High-risk pregnancies can be optimally managed by a multidisciplinary team.
16314,1718,OBJECTIVES: Secondary SS (sSS) is a common extra-articular manifestation of RA.
16315,1718,There are conflicting data regarding the association of sSS with worse joint damage.
16316,1718,This study aims to characterize sSS patients in an RA cohort and study the association between sSS and joint damage.
16317,1718,METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of RA patients with 1 year of follow-up at a large academic centre.
16318,1718,Subjects with co-morbid diseases that can also result in sicca symptoms were excluded from the analysis.
16319,1718,Subjects were considered to have sSS if they were reported as having sSS by their rheumatologist at recruitment into the cohort and had the diagnosis confirmed by chart review.
16320,1718,The primary outcome was Sharp score using bilateral hand radiographs at recruitment.
16321,1718,"We constructed a linear regression model to determine the association of sSS status and Sharp score adjusted by age, gender, disease duration and ACPA and RF status."
16322,1718,"RESULTS: We studied 829 RA subjects, mean age 57 years, 83% female, mean RA duration 13 years, 74% seropositive; 85 subjects (10.3%) had sSS."
16323,1718,"We observed a female predominance (95.3%), longer mean disease duration (16.9 years) and higher frequency of RF or ACPA positive among patients with sSS and RA."
16324,1718,"Having sSS at baseline was associated with higher Sharp scores (P = 0.03), independent of age, gender, RA disease duration and seropositive disease."
16325,1718,"CONCLUSION: In our RA cohort, RA subjects with sSS had worse joint damage, suggesting that sSS is a marker of more aggressive disease."
16326,1719,38 year old woman was admitted with acute onset of quadriplegia.
16327,1719,"Biochemical investigation revealed severe hypokalaemia with hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis, alkaline urine, and positive urinary anion gap which are the hallmark of distal tubular acidosis."
16328,1719,"In addition she also had hypophosphataemia, normoglycaemic glycosuria, aminoaciduria, and hyperphosphaturia suggestive of proximal tubular dysfunction."
16329,1719,Further evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome.
16330,1719,Interestingly our patient also had carpopedal spasm despite normal calcium and magnesium level.
16331,1719,Quadriplegia and carpopedal spasm improved with correction of hypokalaemia and acidosis.
16332,1719,Proximal tubular abnormalities (except albuminuria) were normalised at the time of discharge.
16333,1719,Distal tubular acidosis is a well known renal manifestation of Sjogren's syndrome.
16334,1719,But this type of transient proximal tubular dysfunction with distal tubular acidosis in Sjogren's syndrome is very rare and hypokalaemic tetany also deserves mention.
16335,1720,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the biological effects of belimumab on B cells in the first phase II open-label trial with belimumab in patients with primary SS (pSS) (BELISS).
16336,1720,METHODS: Peripheral blood B cell subsets and their B cell activating factor-receptor (BAFF-R) expression were analysed by multicolour flow cytometry in 10 pSS patients either before or after 24 and 52 weeks of therapy with belimumab.
16337,1720,Serum BAFF levels were analysed by ELISA.
16338,1720,"RESULTS: At baseline, pSS patients showed a significant increase in circulating B cells compared with healthy donors matched for age and sex, with a predominant expansion of transitional and naive B cell subsets."
16339,1720,pSS patients also showed higher serum BAFF levels and lower B cell BAFF-R expression.
16340,1720,Therapy with belimumab in pSS patients induced a significant reduction in transitional and naive B cell subsets to levels similar to those observed in healthy donors.
16341,1720,"Furthermore, belimumab normalized BAFF-R expression in all B subsets comprised within the memory compartment."
16342,1720,"The restoration of B cell frequency and subset composition in response to belimumab was also associated with a decrease in serum levels of Ig, RF, ANAs, and with an increase in the C4 complement fraction."
16343,1720,All of these belimumab-mediated effects were observed after 24 weeks of therapy and maintained until the end of the therapeutic protocol.
16344,1720,"CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings show that targeting BAFF with belimumab is successful in normalizing B cell frequency, phenotype and functions in pSS."
16345,1720,TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov; https://clinicaltrials.gov/; NCT01008982.
16346,1721,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) or autoimmune epithelitis is characterized by focal lymphocytic infiltrates surrounding the tubular epithelium of exocrine glands and by overactivity of the B-cell population.
16347,1721,"Although T cells were long considered the main effectors in SS, recent findings indicating a key role for B cells have prompted studies of treatments designed to deplete the B-cell population."
16348,1721,"Among molecules that can be targeted to achieve B-cell depletion, CD20 and CD22 are surface antigens expressed specifically by B lymphocytes; and the cytokine B-cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) is a TNF receptor ligand involved in B-cell differentiation, survival, and activation."
16349,1721,The aim of this review is to discuss the clinical outcomes of SS patients treated with B-cell depletion.
16350,1722,Acetylcholine type 3 receptor (M3R) is recognized as an autoantigen in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
16351,1722,Assay of anti-M3R antibody levels in serum is fraught with low sensitivity for diagnosis of pSS.
16352,1722,Salivary assay is more likely to improve the diagnostic accuracy.
16353,1722,"Patients with pSS classified either by the American European Consensus Group (AECG) or American college of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, attending rheumatology clinic between October 2014 and July 2015 were included."
16354,1722,"Hospital staff and lupus patients constituted healthy and disease controls, respectively."
16355,1722,"Evaluation of pSS included clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, ESSDAI and ESSPRI scoring."
16356,1722,Unstimulated saliva was collected by the spitting method.
16357,1722,Salivary IgG antibody against M3R (anti-M3R) was quantified by indirect ELISA.
16358,1722,"In this study, 43 patients with pSS, 34 with lupus and 42 healthy controls were recruited."
16359,1722,"The frequency of anti-M3R antibody levels was 55.81, 17.64 and 7 % for pSS, lupus and healthy controls, respectively."
16360,1722,"Area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic was 0.7791 (95 % CI,, 0.67-0.87)."
16361,1722,"Sensitivity and specificity of the assay for diagnosis of pSS were 44.19 and 88.16 %, respectively."
16362,1722,"Salivary anti-M3R IgG antibody positivity was associated with lower age, shorter disease duration and higher globulin levels in our cohort."
16363,1722,Salivary anti-M3R IgG antibody assay has high specificity in pSS; younger patients and those with hyperglobulinemia more frequently tested positive for this antibody.
16364,1723,PURPOSE: Indicators of aging such as disruption of telomeric function due to shortening may be more frequent in dysfunctional lacrimal gland.
16365,1723,The aims of this study were to 1) determine the viability of quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization of telomeres (telo-FISH) for the assessment of telomere length in lacrimal gland in Sjgren and non- Sjgren syndrome patients; and 2) investigate the relationship between progenitor cell markers and telomere length in both groups.
16366,1723,METHODS: Quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization with a peptide nucleic acid probe complementary to the telomere repeat sequence was performed on frozen sections from human lacrimal gland tissues.
16367,1723,The mean fluorescence intensity of telomere spots was automatically quantified by image analysis as relative telomere length in lacrimal gland epithelial cells.
16368,1723,"Immunostaining for p63, nucleostemin, ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G, member 2 (ABCG2), and nestin was also performed."
16369,1723,"RESULTS: Telomere intensity in the Sjgren syndrome group (6,785.0455) was significantly lower than that in the non-Sjgren syndrome group (7,494.7477; p=0.02)."
16370,1723,"Among the samples from the non-Sjgren syndrome group, immunostaining revealed that p63 was expressed in 1-3 acinar cells in each acinar unit and continuously in the basal layer of duct cells."
16371,1723,"In contrast, in the Sjgren syndrome group, p63 and nucleostemin showed a lower level of expression."
16372,1723,ABCG2 was expressed in acinar cells in both sjogren and non-Sjogren syndrome.
16373,1723,"CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that 1) telo-FISH is a viable method of assessing telomere length in lacrimal gland, and 2) telomere length in Sjgren syndrome is shorter and associated with lower levels of expression of p63 and nucleostemin than in non-Sjgren syndrome."
16374,1724,Key events in the pathogenesis of Sjgren syndrome (SS) include the change of salivary gland epithelial cells into antigen-presenting cell-like phenotypes and focal lymphocytic sialadenitis (FLS).
16375,1724,"However, what triggers these features in SS is unknown."
16376,1724,"Dysbiosis of the gut and oral microbiomes is a potential environmental factor in SS, but its connection to the etiopathogenesis of SS remains unclear."
16377,1724,This study aimed to characterize the oral microbiota in SS and to investigate its potential role in the pathogenesis of SS.
16378,1724,Oral bacterial communities were collected by whole mouthwash from control subjects (14 without oral dryness and 11 with dryness) and primary SS patients (8 without oral dryness and 17 with dryness) and were analyzed by pyrosequencing.
16379,1724,The SS oral microbiota was characterized by an increased bacterial load and Shannon diversity.
16380,1724,"Through comparisons of control and SS in combined samples and then separately in non-dry and dry conditions, SS-associated taxa independent of dryness were identified."
16381,1724,Three SS-associated species and 2 control species were selected and used to challenge human submandibular gland tumor (HSG) cells.
16382,1724,"Among the selected SS-associated bacterial species, Prevotella melaninogenica uniquely upregulated the expression of MHC molecules, CD80, and IFN in HSG cells."
16383,1724,"Concomitantly, P. melaninogenica efficiently invaded HSG cells."
16384,1724,Sections of labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsies from 8 non-SS subjects and 15 SS patients were subjected to in situ hybridization using universal and P. melaninogenica-specific probes.
16385,1724,Ductal cells and the areas of infiltration were heavily infected with bacteria in the LSGs with FLS.
16386,1724,"Collectively, dysbiotic oral microbiota may initiate the deregulation of SGECs and the IFN signature through bacterial invasion into ductal cells."
16387,1724,These findings may provide new insights into the etiopathogenesis of SS.
16388,1725,"PURPOSE: To evaluate, on the basis of our clinical experience, the reliability of an endoscopic approach to the management of obstructive salivary diseases related to Sjgren's syndrome."
16389,1725,MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients affected by Sjgren's syndrome who were followed up at the Maxillo-Facial Unit of the Second University of Naples Hospital and referred from the Reumatology Unit of the same hospital from September 2007 to July 2012 for chronic obstructive sialadenitis unresponsive to medical therapy.
16390,1725,A total of 34 patients (29 women and 5 men) were recruited for this study.
16391,1725,"After the detection of the impaired gland, under local anesthesia with lidocaine 2% to the orifice region and a gradual dilation of the duct orifice, the diagnostic unit was introduced into the duct and was advanced forward until reaching the ductal system, with continuous lavage with isotonic saline solution."
16392,1725,"The plaques were washed out, and any strictures were dilated."
16393,1725,Mucus plugs and debris were removed with irrigation or with a forceps if necessary.
16394,1725,RESULTS: Our cohort included 34 patients with a mean age of 51.76 years.
16395,1725,A total of 60 parotid glands and 25 submandibular glands were explored and treated.
16396,1725,"Strictures were found in 38 glands (38 of 85; 45%), mucus plugs in 47 glands (47 of 85; 55%), mucus plugs and strictures together in three glands (3 of 85; 4%), and kinks in two glands (2 of 85; 2%)."
16397,1725,"In 32 parotid glands (32 of 60; 53%) the Stensen duct was affected, in two (2 of 60; 3%) only secondary ducts, and in 18 (18 of 60; 30%) both."
16398,1725,"In submandibular glands explored, strictures and mucus plugs were mainly observed in Wharton ducts."
16399,1725,"Symptomatic improvement was achieved in 29 patients (29 of 34; 85%), in a follow-up period ranging from 5 months to 3 years."
16400,1725,CONCLUSIONS: Interventional sialoendoscopy is a viable technique to treat acute symptomatology in patients with obstructive salivary gland diseases related to Sjgren's syndrome and refractory to conventional management.
16401,1726,OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a clinically heterogeneous disease with limited reliable diagnostic biomarkers.
16402,1726,We investigated whether gene methylation could meet sensitivity and specificity criteria for a robust biomarker.
16403,1726,"METHODS: IFI44L promoter methylation was examined using DNA samples from a discovery set including 377 patients with SLE, 358 healthy controls (HCs) and 353 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)."
16404,1726,"Two independent sets including 1144 patients with SLE, 1350 HCs, 429 patients with RA and 199 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) were used for validation."
16405,1726,"RESULTS: Significant hypomethylation of two CpG sites within IFI44L promoter, Site1 (Chr1: 79085222) and Site2 (Chr1: 79085250; cg06872964), was identified in patients with SLE compared with HCs, patients with RA and patients with pSS."
16406,1726,"In a comparison between patients with SLE and HCs included in the first validation cohort, Site1 methylation had a sensitivity of 93.6% and a specificity of 96.8% at a cut-off methylation level of 75.5% and Site2 methylation had a sensitivity of 94.1% and a specificity of 98.2% at a cut-off methylation level of 25.5%."
16407,1726,The IFI44L promoter methylation marker was also validated in an European-derived cohort.
16408,1726,"In addition, the methylation levels of Site1 and Site2 within IFI44L promoter were significantly lower in patients with SLE with renal damage than those without renal damage."
16409,1726,Patients with SLE showed significantly increased methylation levels of Site1 and Site2 during remission compared with active stage.
16410,1726,"CONCLUSIONS: The methylation level of IFI44L promoter can distinguish patients with SLE from healthy persons and other autoimmune diseases, and is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for SLE."
16411,1727,OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy of casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) and casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate (CPP-ACFP) containing pastes among individuals with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
16412,1727,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients were randomised into three groups: CPP-ACP, CPP-ACFP, and 0.05 % NaF to be used two times a day during a 28-day experimental period."
16413,1727,"Saliva was analysed for flow rate, pH, buffering capacity and mineral concentrations."
16414,1727,Dental plaque was examined for pH.
16415,1727,"Following the formation of artificial carious lesion, participants wore enamel slabs for an in situ remineralisation study."
16416,1727,Remineralisation potential was examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) technique.
16417,1727,"SE microphotographs were subsequently analysed for area, diameter, perimeter, roundness and the number of enamel defects and percentage of tooth surface affected by defects."
16418,1727,"RESULTS: At the end of the experimental period, a slight increase of salivary pH could have been observed."
16419,1727,No differences in mineral composition of saliva were noted.
16420,1727,The use of CPP-ACP and CPP-ACFP contributed to a significant rise of plaque pH.
16421,1727,"Image analysis revealed excessive reduction of defects' dimensions in the three experimental groups, and a decrease of the number of enamel defects in the CPP-ACP and CPP-ACFP groups."
16422,1727,"The EDS analysis did not show differences in Ca/P, Ca/O and P/O ratios in any of the treatment groups."
16423,1727,CONCLUSION: CPP-ACP and CPP-ACFP hold promise as remineralising agents for patients with SS.
16424,1727,CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Pastes containing CPP-ACP/CPP-ACFP show enhanced remineralisation potential compared with NaF mouthrinse in patients with SS.
16425,1728,We conducted this study to characterize the relationship between primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS)-associated peripheral neuropathy (PN) and markers of B-cell monoclonal proliferation and chronic activation.
16426,1728,The cohort included 120 consecutive patients presenting with definite pSS according to the American-European Consensus Group criteria.
16427,1728,Serum markers of chronic B-cell activation included autoantibodies and hypergammaglobulinemia.
16428,1728,"Markers of monoclonal B-cell proliferation included mixed cryoglobulin, monoclonal gammopathy, abnormal / free light chain (FLC) ratio, and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL)."
16429,1728,"Definite PN was present in 30 patients (25%) including 7 patients (23%) with sensorimotor neuropathy, 3 patients (10%) with ataxic sensory neuropathy, and 20 patients (67%) with nonataxic sensory neuropathy."
16430,1728,"Patients with a sensorimotor neuropathy differed from those without PN by higher rates of monoclonal B-cell proliferation markers, that is, mixed cryoglobulin (57% vs. 11%; p = 0.008), monoclonal gammopathy (71% vs. 17%; p = 0.004), higher FLC ratio (2.7  1.5 vs. 1.7  1.8; p = 0.024), and B-NHL (57% vs. 3%; p < 0.001)."
16431,1728,"Patients with nonataxic sensory neuropathy were characterized by a higher age (57.5  10.7 vs. 48.7  14.3 years; p = 0.007), more frequent central nervous system (CNS) involvement (15% vs. 2%; p = 0.04) and a lower prevalence of chronic B-cell activation serum markers, that is, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (60% vs. 90%; p = 0.003), anti-SSA (Ro) (40% vs. 72%; p = 0.009), anti-SSB (La) (15% vs. 41%; p = 0.039), rheumatoid factor (37% vs. 67%; p = 0.02), and hypergammaglobulinemia (35% vs. 64%; p = 0.023)."
16432,1728,"In multivariate analysis, sensorimotor neuropathy was associated with the presence of B-NHL (odds ratio [OR], 39.0; p < 0.001), whereas nonataxic sensory neuropathy was associated with the presence of CNS involvement (OR, 17.0; p = 0.025) and ANA (OR, 0.07; p < 0.001)."
16433,1728,"In conclusion, we found that up to 25% of pSS patients presented with PN, predominantly sensory neuropathy."
16434,1728,"Distinctive immunologic profiles were found according to the type of SS-associated neuropathy: nonataxic sensory neuropathy was marked by a low prevalence of B-cell activation markers, and sensorimotor neuropathy was marked by a high prevalence of B-cell monoclonal proliferation markers."
16435,1729,OBJECTIVES: To assess how patients perceived pain and change of sensibility of the biopsied area after having undergone parotid and labial gland biopsy as part of the diagnostic work-up of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
16436,1729,"METHODS: Simultaneously, parotid and labial salivary gland biopsies were taken under local anesthesia."
16437,1729,"One week, 6 months and 12 months post-operatively, each patient was sent a postal questionnaire to quantify the severity of pain and change of sensibility in the biopsied areas with a visual analogue scale (VAS; range 0-100)."
16438,1729,RESULTS: 110 patients were included.
16439,1729,The median age of patients was 54 years (IQR=47-65) and 92% were female.
16440,1729,"Changes in sensibility and pain in the biopsied area were significantly higher after a parotid gland biopsy than after a labial gland biopsy at one week and 6 months post-operatively, but rather minor in both areas."
16441,1729,"At 12 months post-operatively, the change in sensibility and pain level was negligible in most patients and comparable for both biopsied areas."
16442,1729,"The duration of the technique, outcome of the biopsy, exposure of nerve branches during the biopsy and bleeding during the biopsy did not affect the reported change of sensibility or pain in the biopsied area."
16443,1729,ESSPRI was not related to pain level or change of sensibility at any time point (r<0.3 and p>0.05).
16444,1729,CONCLUSIONS: Patient-reported post-operative change of sensibility and pain in the area of the parotid and labial gland biopsy are minor and comparable.
16445,1729,Parotid and labial gland biopsies are diagnostic techniques well tolerated by patients suspected with pSS.
16446,1730,PURPOSE: To provide a consensus clinical guideline for management of dry eye disease associated with Sjgren disease by evaluating published treatments and recommending management options.
16447,1730,DESIGN: Consensus panel evaluation of reported treatments for dry eye disease.
16448,1730,"METHODS: Using the 2007 Report of the International Workshop on Dry Eye (DEWS) as a starting point, a panel of eye care providers and consultants evaluated peer-reviewed publications and developed recommendations for evaluation and management of dry eye disease associated with Sjgren disease."
16449,1730,Publications were graded according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines for level of evidence.
16450,1730,"Strength of recommendation was according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines."
16451,1730,RESULTS: The recommendations of the panel are briefly summarized herein.
16452,1730,Evaluation should include symptoms of both discomfort and visual disturbance as well as determination of the relative contribution of aqueous production deficiency and evaporative loss of tear volume.
16453,1730,"Objective parameters of tear film stability, tear osmolarity, degree of lid margin disease, and ocular surface damage should be used to stage severity of dry eye disease to assist in selecting appropriate treatment options."
16454,1730,"Patient education with regard to the nature of the problem, aggravating factors, and goals of treatment is critical to successful management."
16455,1730,"Tear supplementation and stabilization, control of inflammation of the lacrimal glands and ocular surface, and possible stimulation of tear production are treatment options that are used according to the character and severity of dry eye disease."
16456,1730,SUMMARY: Management guidelines for dry eye associated with Sjgren's disease are presented.
16457,1731,"Etiology of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is still unknown, but there is strong evidence that certain pathogens of bacterial or viral origin can incite autoimmune response."
16458,1731,"The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate changes of the main cell populations (dendritic cells, natural killer, natural killer T and cytotoxic T lymphocytes) presumably participating in virus clearance in peripheral blood of patients with primary SS (pSS)."
16459,1731,"In analyzing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) populations we observed alterations in the frequency of highly cytotoxic effector CD8(high)/57(+)/27(-)/45RA(+), less cytotoxic CD8(high)/57(-)/27(-)/45RA(+) effector cells and cytotoxic memory CD8(high)/57(+)/27(+)/45RA(-) effector cells."
16460,1731,We found a decrease of conventional dendritic cells (cDC) population in peripheral blood of pSS patients.
16461,1731,"It is possible that, a decrease of effector CTL and cDC, accompanied by increase of transitory phenotype memory CTL in peripheral blood of pSS patients may be associated with viral etiopathogenesis of Sjgren's syndrome."
16462,1732,"Sjgren syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by dry mouth and eyes, and the cellular and molecular mechanisms for its pathogenesis are complex."
16463,1732,"Here we reveal, for the first time, that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in SS-like NOD/Ltj mice and human patients were defective in immunoregulatory functions."
16464,1732,"Importantly, treatment with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) suppressed autoimmunity and restored salivary gland secretory function in both mouse models and SS patients."
16465,1732,"MSC treatment directed T cells toward Treg and Th2, while suppressing Th17 and Tfh responses, and alleviated disease symptoms."
16466,1732,"Infused MSCs migrated toward the inflammatory regions in a stromal cell-derived factor-1-dependent manner, as neutralization of stromal cell-derived factor-1 ligand CXCR4 abolished the effectiveness of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell treatment."
16467,1732,"Collectively, our study suggests that immunologic regulatory functions of MSCs play an important role in SS pathogenesis, and allogeneic MSC treatment may provide a novel, effective, and safe therapy for patients with SS."
16468,1733,Topical ocular anaesthetic agents are frequently used for ophthalmic diagnosis and surgery.
16469,1733,"While corneal complications following long-term use or misuse of local anaesthetic solutions have been described, toxic epitheliopathy after a single application of six drops of preservative free oxybuprocaine is rare."
16470,1733,"In order to increase the awareness of this ocular complication, we report such a case in a patient with Sjogren's syndrome who presented for elective cataract surgery."
16471,1733,We outline the mechanisms proposed to explain the ocular toxic effects of oxybuprocaine and discuss the management principles in preventing this complication in the context of Sjogren's syndrome.
16472,1734,BACKGROUND: The different characteristics of usual interstitial pneumonia in patients with primary Sjgrens syndrome (UIP/pSS) compared with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (UIP/IPF) are not fully understood.
16473,1734,"This study aimed to compare characteristics, prognosis, and treatment responses in these patients."
16474,1734,"METHODS: Among 129 consecutive patients who underwent surgical lung biopsy to diagnose diffuse lung diseases at Kanagawa Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center between 1998 and 2002, we identified 10 and 19 patients with UIP/pSS and UIP/IPF, respectively."
16475,1734,"Baseline characteristics, chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and pathological findings, and the clinical course were compared between the two groups."
16476,1734,Responses to immunosuppressive therapy were analyzed by comparing pulmonary function and clinical status before and one year after treatment initiation.
16477,1734,"RESULTS: More patients in the UIP/pSS group tended to be female and older than those in the UIP/IPF group (mean age, 68 years vs. 62 years)."
16478,1734,"In addition, they more commonly exhibited enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and bronchial wall thickening on HRCT."
16479,1734,"Pathologically, in the UIP/pSS group, interstitial inflammation, plasma cell infiltration, lymphoid follicles with germinal centers, cysts, bronchiolitis, and pleuritis were significantly more prominent, whereas smooth muscle hyperplasia and fibroblastic foci were milder (all P<0.05)."
16480,1734,The prognosis was better for UIP/pSS compared with UIP/IPF patients (P=0.01).
16481,1734,"In addition, immunosuppressive therapy provided better disease control for those with UIP/pSS (83%, 5/6) compared UIP/IPF (7%, 1/15)."
16482,1734,"CONCLUSION: This study identified distinct clinical, radiological, and pathological characteristics of UIP/pSS compared with UIP/IPF."
16483,1734,Immunosuppressive treatment could be a therapeutic option for UIP/pSS.
16484,1735,The autoimmune disorder primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is associated with xerostomia and xerophthalmia.
16485,1735,SS pathogenesis involves both genetic/epigenetic and environmental factors.
16486,1735,"A major potential contributor is oxidative stress associated with damage to cellular components, including DNA."
16487,1735,"We reported previously that the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) normalizes the elevated levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a key component of DNA repair, in the NOD mouse model for SS and type 1 diabetes."
16488,1735,"The current study examined levels of the antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as PCNA, in NOD.B10.Sn-H2 mice, a model for primary SS, and determined the effect of EGCG on their expression."
16489,1735,"PCNA elevation was detected in the submandibular gland and pancreas by 8 weeks of age in water-fed mice, and increased through 14 weeks of age, prior to overt onset of symptoms."
16490,1735,This early PCNA elevation was followed by a decline of peroxiredoxin 6 protein.
16491,1735,"In contrast, EGCG-fed mice exhibited normal levels of PCNA and peroxiredoxin 6, comparable to healthy untreated BALB/c mice."
16492,1735,"Similar patterns were observed in the pancreas, even though these mice do not develop diabetes."
16493,1735,"Thus, elevated PCNA is an early biomarker for exocrine glandular dysfunction associated with SS-like autoimmune disease, accompanied subsequently by decreased PRDX6 antioxidant enzyme levels that could further contribute to oxidative stress, and these changes precede inflammatory cell infiltration."
16494,1735,"Importantly, EGCG consumption normalizes the expression of these biomarkers in this model."
16495,1735,These observations could lead to early diagnosis and intervention of autoimmune disorders.
16496,1736,IMPORTANCE: Knowledge about the variability of measurements using the TearLab Osmolarity System is necessary when evaluating the clinical utility of readings.
16497,1736,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the variability of tear osmolarity measured by the TearLab Osmolarity System in patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS), patients with blepharitis, and control participants."
16498,1736,"DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study at a tertiary care academic center from June 13, 2012, to March 21, 2013."
16499,1736,"Participants included 74 eyes of 37 patients from a volunteer sample (18 patients with SS, 11 patients with blepharitis, and 8 control participants) who were evaluated using the TearLab Osmolarity System, with 3 consecutive osmolarity measurements taken at 1-minute intervals in a session; 15 of these patients had the same measurements taken by the same examiner in 2 additional sessions on the same day (9 AM-10 AM, 12 PM-1 PM, or 3 PM-4 PM)."
16500,1736,Most patients with SS and patients with blepharitis were taking systemic or topical dry eye medications at the time of enrollment.
16501,1736,"MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean osmolarity and its variability calculated from a linear mixed model for each disease group that accounts for the variations attributable to different patients, eyes, and sessions and measurement error specific to each disease group."
16502,1736,"RESULTS: Mean tear osmolarity was 307 mOsm/L, 304 mOsm/L, and 301 mOsm/L in the SS, blepharitis, and control groups, respectively (P=.46)."
16503,1736,"The error associated with repeated measurements within a session in the patients without dry eye (10.5 mOsm/L [95% CI, 9.0-12.4]) was significantly lower than in the patients with blepharitis (14.6 mOsm/L [95% CI, 12.5-17.5]; P=.006) and patients with SS (15.8 mOsm/L [95% CI, 14.2-17.8]; P<.001) but a difference in the error of repeated measurements between patients with blepharitis and patients with SS was not identified (P=.46)."
16504,1736,CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There was increased variability attributable to error in repeated measurements in patients with SS and patients with blepharitis compared with control participants.
16505,1736,The high variability of TearLab osmolarity readings in all groups makes the clinical interpretation of measurements unclear.
16506,1737,"OBJECTIVES: To compare salivary cytokine profiles in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), non-SS sicca controls, and non-sicca controls, and to investigate whether cytokine levels are correlated with clinical parameters of pSS patients."
16507,1737,METHODS: Un-stimulated whole saliva samples were obtained from pSS patients (n=30) classified according to the criteria of the American European Consensus Group.
16508,1737,Age- and gender-matched non-SS sicca patients (n=30) and non-sicca subjects (n=25) served as controls.
16509,1737,"Salivary IFN-, TNF-, IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, and IL-17 levels were measured using a multiplex Luminex bead-based assay."
16510,1737,"RESULTS: pSS patients and non-SS sicca controls had significantly lower salivary flow rates (SFRs) than non-sicca controls, and pSS patients showed a more profound decrease than non-SS sicca controls."
16511,1737,"In addition, pSS patients and non-SS sicca controls had higher levels of IFN-, TNF-, IL-1, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p40, and IL-17 in their saliva than non-sicca controls."
16512,1737,Salivary TNF- levels were higher in pSS patients than in non-SS sicca controls.
16513,1737,"Th-1/Th-2 ratios, represented by INF-/IL-4 and TNF- /IL-4 ratios, were significantly higher in pSS patients than in non-SS sicca controls."
16514,1737,"SFR was found to be correlated with INF-/IL-4 ratio (r=0.411 p=0.024), and focus score to be correlated with TNF-/IL-4 ratio (r=0.581, p=0.023) in pSS patients."
16515,1737,"CONCLUSIONS: Th-1, Th-2, and Th17 cytokine levels were found to be elevated in the saliva of pSS patients compared with non-sicca controls."
16516,1737,"However, considerable overlap was observed between the salivary cytokine levels of pSS patients and of non-SS sicca controls."
16517,1737,The features that most differentiated pSS and non-SS sicca were higher TNF- levels and Th-1/Th-2 ratios.
16518,1737,Th-1/Th-2 ratio was also found to be correlated with the clinical parameters of pSS.
16519,1738,"Here, we present a case of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma in the thymus with multiple amyloid nodules in both lung."
16520,1738,A 66-year-old woman was incidentally found to have an abnormal shadow on mass-screening chest roentgenogram.
16521,1738,A chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a mass of 50 mm in diameter with a smooth margin adjacent to the heart in the anterior mediastinum and multiple small nodules in both lung.
16522,1738,"As a differential diagnosis, thymic carcinoma with multiple lung metastases was firstly considered from these clinical informations."
16523,1738,"To make a definite diagnosis, the operation via a thoracoscopy was done."
16524,1738,"As a result, it turned out that pulmonary nodules were amyloidosis and the thymic tumor was MALT lymphoma."
16525,1738,Postoperative course was uneventful and she was treated with chemoradiotherapy.
16526,1738,"In addition, she was diagnosed with Sjgren's syndrome 1 and half years later."
16527,1738,Four years later the patient has been well without recurrence.
16528,1739,BACKGROUND: To report a case of orbital inflammation after bisphosphonate infusion in a patient who was already receiving immunosuppressive therapy.
16529,1739,CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old woman presented to the ophthalmology clinic with acute onset of right eye pain 24h after receiving her first Zolendronic acid infusion.
16530,1739,"She has a past medical history of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Sjogren's syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus that have been controlled with immunosuppressive therapy for three years."
16531,1739,Clinical ophthalmic exam and MRI studies were significant for right orbital inflammation.
16532,1739,The patient was started on oral prednisone with rapid resolution of symptoms.
16533,1739,CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case report of a patient receiving chronic immunosuppressive therapy to develop orbital inflammation after Zoledronic acid infusion.
16534,1739,"In addition, it demonstrates that corticosteroids can be an effective first line therapy in treating orbital inflammation in similar patients."
16535,1739,"Physicians should be aware of this rare but serious potential side effect of bisphosphonates, and have bisphosphonate-related orbital inflammation on their differential for proper initiation of treatment."
16536,1740,AIMS: To evaluate the clinical outcomes following Moscow Eye Microsurgery Complex in Russia keratoprosthesis (MICOF KPro) implantation in end-stage autoimmune dry eyes.
16537,1740,METHODS: A retrospective observational case series.
16538,1740,Fourteen patients with end-stage autoimmune dry eyes underwent MICOF KPro surgery by one surgeon (YH) in the Chinese PLA General Hospital between 2000 and 2009.
16539,1740,Retention of the prosthesis and vision were recorded and postoperative complications were analysed.
16540,1740,"RESULTS: Preoperative diagnosis included Stevens-Johnson syndrome (n=7), ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (n=4) and Sjogren's syndrome (n=3)."
16541,1740,The mean follow-up period was 3.9 years (range 10 months-7.8 years).
16542,1740,"After surgery, 13 eyes (93%) showed a visual acuity of 20/200 or better and 6 eyes (43%) achieved excellent vision of 20/40 or better."
16543,1740,"At last visit, 69% of the eyes (9/13) maintained a visual acuity of at least 20/200."
16544,1740,The first case retained a visual acuity of 20/80 7.8 years after the operation.
16545,1740,The most common complication was stromal melting that threatened anatomical success.
16546,1740,"Seven of the first eight patients showed tissue melting, and four of them had leakage."
16547,1740,All of these were repaired successfully.
16548,1740,The latter six cases received prophylactic autologous auricular cartilage implantation to reinforce the anterior surface of recipient's cornea at either stage 1 or 2.
16549,1740,"Other causes of vision loss included pre-existing glaucoma (n=6), sterile vitritis (n=5), cylinder loosening (n=1) and retroprosthetic membrane (n=4)."
16550,1740,CONCLUSION: MICOF KPro provided useful vision for the end stage of autoimmune dry eyes in our study.
16551,1740,Anatomical stability of KPro was achieved in all cases using repair and reinforcing surgery.
16552,1741,Eponyms serve the purpose of honoring individuals who have made important observations and discoveries.
16553,1741,"As with other fields of medicine, eponyms are frequently encountered in radiology, particularly in chest radiology."
16554,1741,"However, inappropriate use of an eponym may lead to potentially dangerous miscommunication."
16555,1741,"Moreover, an eponym may honor the incorrect person or a person who falls into disrepute."
16556,1741,"Despite their limitations, eponyms are still widespread in the medical literature."
16557,1741,"Furthermore, in some circumstances, more than one individual may have contributed to the description or discovery of a particular anatomical structure or disease, whereas in others, an eponym may have been incorrectly applied initially and propagated for years in the medical literature."
16558,1741,"Nevertheless, radiologic eponyms are a means of honoring those who have made lasting contributions to the field of radiology, and familiarity with these eponyms is critical for proper reporting and accurate communication."
16559,1741,"In addition, the acquisition of some historical knowledge about those whose names are associated with various structures or pathologic conditions conveys a sense of humanity in the science of medicine."
16560,1741,"In this third installment of this series, the authors discuss a number of chest radiology eponyms as they relate to the pulmonary interstitium, including relevant clinical and imaging features, as well biographical information of the respective eponym's namesake."
16561,1742,We herein report the case of a 64-year old woman with recurrent attacks of hypokalemic quadriparesis which resulted from distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) secondary to Sjgren syndrome.
16562,1742,The patient presented with sudden onset quadriparesis.
16563,1742,A physical examination showed symmetric weakness of all four limbs.
16564,1742,"Severe hypokalemia (1.8 mEq/L), accompanied by normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, a positive urine anion gap and an inappropriately high urine pH pointed toward the diagnosis of dRTA."
16565,1742,"Further investigations disclosed primary Sjgren syndrome, which had not previously been recognized."
16566,1742,On the basis of the current report and a review of the literature we suggest investigating the possibility of Sjgren syndrome in all patients with clinically unexplained dRTA.
16567,1743,"Objective: To analysis the clinical manifestation, radiological data, laboratory findings of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) to help physicians have a deeper understanding of the disease."
16568,1743,"Methods: The clinical manifestations, radiological data, laboratory findings of NMOSD patients from People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University between June 2015 and June 2016 were retrospectively analyzed."
16569,1743,"Results: Fourteen patients with NMOSD were enrolled, consisting of 3 males and 11 females."
16570,1743,"The onset age ranged from 15 to 62 years, in average 39.64."
16571,1743,"Among them, there was 1 case with history of hyperthyroidism, 3 cases with Sjgren syndrome (SS)."
16572,1743,"Major clinical manifestations were vision loss in 4 cases, nausea and vomiting in 4 cases, limbs numbness and weakness in 6 cases."
16573,1743,"All the 14 patients were received the cerebrospinal fluidcell surface antigen antibody detection, and the results were strong positive 6 cases (6/14), positive 7 cases (7/14), weak positive 1 case (1/14)."
16574,1743,"Abnormal signals in the thirdventricle, midbrain aqueduct, oblongata, pons and cervical, thoracic spinal cord were found by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)."
16575,1743,"Fourteen patients were treated with glucocorticoid, among them 8 received immunosuppressive therapy."
16576,1743,"All the 14 patients were followed up, and 9 patients had different degrees of sequelae, including vision decline in 4 cases, numbness and weakness in 5 cases."
16577,1743,Conclusions: Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders frequently occur in young female.
16578,1743,"Clinicians need to consider the possibility of NMOSD for acute or subacute blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, numbness and weakness of limbs or trunk and psychiatric symptoms."
16579,1743,"NMOSD can not be easily excluded for those special patients with atypical clinical manifestations, and relevant inspections should be performed as far as possible in order to make the correct diagnosis."
16580,1744,"Transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-1) plays a crucial role in the induction of fibrosis, often associated with chronic phases of inflammatory diseases contributing to marked fibrotic changes that compromise normal organ function."
16581,1744,"The TGF-1 signal exerts its biological effects via the TGF-/SMAD/Snail signaling pathway, playing an important pathogenic role in several fibrotic diseases."
16582,1744,It has as yet been poorly investigated in the chronic autoimmune disease Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
16583,1744,"Here, we firstly tested, by immunohistochemistry, whether the TGF-1/SMAD/Snail signaling pathway is triggered in human pSS salivary glands (SGs)."
16584,1744,"Next, healthy salivary gland epithelial cell (SGEC) cultures derived from healthy donors were exposed to TGF-1 treatment, and the relative gene and protein levels of SMAD2/3/4, Snail, E-cadherin, vimentin, and collagen type I were compared by semiquantitative RT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR, and Western blot analysis."
16585,1744,"We observed, both at gene and protein levels, higher expression of SMAD2, 3, and 4 and Snail in the SGEC exposed by TGF-1 compared to untreated healthy SGEC."
16586,1744,"Additionally, in TGF-1-treated samples, we found a significant reduction in the epithelial phenotype marker E-cadherin and an increase in the mesenchymal phenotype markers vimentin and collagen type I compared to those in untreated SGEC, indicating that TGF-1 induces the EMT via the TGF-1/SMAD/Snail signaling pathway."
16587,1744,"Therefore, by using the specific TGF- receptor 1 inhibitor SB-431542 in healthy SGEC treated with TGF-1, we showed a significant reduction of the fibrosis markers vimentin and collagen type I while the epithelial marker E-cadherin returns to levels similar to untreated healthy SGEC."
16588,1744,These data demonstrate that TGF-1 is an important key factor in the transition phase from SG chronic inflammation to fibrotic disease.
16589,1744,Characteristic changes in the morphology and function of TGF-1-treated healthy SGEC further confirm that TGF-1 plays a significant role in EMT-dependent fibrosis.
16590,1745,OBJECTIVE: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltrates associated with destruction of salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs) induced mainly by apoptosis.
16591,1745,Adiponectin is an immunoregulatory hormone.
16592,1745,We have previously shown that SGECs from patients with primary SS as well as from controls differentially express adiponectin.
16593,1745,SGECs derived from patients with primary SS constitutively produce and secrete adiponectin in higher quantities.
16594,1745,The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of adiponectin on the proliferation and apoptosis of SGECs.
16595,1745,"METHODS: Cultured, non-neoplastic SGECs were treated with recombinant human adiponectin, and the rate of cell proliferation was assessed."
16596,1745,Spontaneous and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma)-induced apoptosis was evaluated with a specific single-stranded DNA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
16597,1745,The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor Compound C was used to test the involvement of AMPK in adiponectin effects.
16598,1745,Western blotting was applied to detect the phosphorylation levels of AMPK after adiponectin treatment.
16599,1745,RESULTS: Adiponectin treatment resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of proliferation of SGECs from patients with primary SS and control donors.
16600,1745,Adiponectin protected cells from spontaneous as well as from IFNgamma-induced apoptosis.
16601,1745,"Furthermore, the antiapoptotic effects of adiponectin were dependent upon AMPK phosphorylation at Thr(172), since pretreatment of SGECs with Compound C abolished the adiponectin protective effect."
16602,1745,CONCLUSION: Adiponectin exerted antiproliferative effects on SGECs without inducing apoptosis and protected SGECs from spontaneous as well as from IFNgamma-induced apoptosis through an AMPK-dependent pathway.
16603,1745,"Our observations suggest that adiponectin may protect SGECs in this specific inflammatory milieu, providing a potential pathway through which AMPK may regulate cell survival under energy stress conditions such as autoimmune inflammation."
16604,1746,"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is one of the most serious pulmonary complications associated with connective tissue diseases (CTDs), resulting in significant morbidity and mortality."
16605,1746,"Although the various CTDs associated with ILD often are considered together because of their shared autoimmune nature, there are substantial differences in the clinical presentations and management of ILD in each specific CTD."
16606,1746,This heterogeneity and the cross-disciplinary nature of care have complicated the conduct of prospective multicenter treatment trials and hindered our understanding of the development of ILD in patients with CTD.
16607,1746,"In this update, we present new information regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with ILD secondary to systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, and Sjgren syndrome."
16608,1746,We review information on risk factors for the development of ILD in the setting of CTD.
16609,1746,Diagnostic criteria for CTD are presented as well as elements of the clinical evaluation that increase suspicion for CTD-ILD.
16610,1746,We review the use of medications in the treatment of CTD-ILD.
16611,1746,"Although a large, randomized study has examined the impact of immunosuppressive therapy for ILD secondary to systemic sclerosis, additional studies are needed to determine optimal treatment strategies for each distinct form of CTD-ILD."
16612,1746,"Finally, we review new information regarding the subgroup of patients with ILD who meet some, but not all, diagnostic criteria for a CTD."
16613,1746,A careful and systematic approach to diagnosis in patients with ILD may reveal an unrecognized CTD or evidence of autoimmunity in those previously believed to have idiopathic ILD.
16614,1747,OBJECTIVES: Interstitial lung disease is a life-threatening complication of many systemic autoimmune diseases with diverse clinical and histopathological features.
16615,1747,"Among them, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) is mainly associated with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
16616,1747,"A case of a middle-aged man with LIP, anti-Ro/La, anti-Scl70 autoantibodies and overlapping histopathological features of pSS and systemic sclerosis (SSc) is presented and discussed."
16617,1747,METHODS: A 65-year-old man complaining for easy fatigue and dry cough was evaluated.
16618,1747,Physical examination revealed bibasilar crackles on auscultation.
16619,1747,Imaging tests showed areas of centrilobular nodules with tree-in-bud sign on the medial lobe of the right lung.
16620,1747,Pulmonary function tests demonstrated small airways disease.
16621,1747,"Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated ESR and CRP, ANA titre >1/320, positive Ro52, Ro60 and La autoantibodies but also, weakly positive anti Scl70 autoantibody."
16622,1747,RESULTS: Right lobe lung biopsy showed diffuse fibrosis with altered alveolar architecture and diffuse infiltration of alveolar septa by lymphocytes and mast cells.
16623,1747,"Ectopic germinal centres were disclosed, adjacent to the small bronchi causing lumen obstruction and validated after the demonstration of CD23 expression, specific for follicular dendritic cells."
16624,1747,"Biopsy of minor salivary glands revealed intense periductal fibrosis with limited round cell infiltrates, not fulfilling the histopathological criteria for pSS."
16625,1747,The diagnosis of LIP was established and the patient received corticosteroids with poor response.
16626,1747,Subsequently he was treated with rituximab with satisfactory results.
16627,1747,"CONCLUSIONS: This case with LIP and disease-specific autoantibodies for pSS and SSc teaches the complexity and overlapping nature of both diseases, extending from autoimmune epithelitis with ectopic germinal centres to fibrosis-related SSc."
16628,1747,"It points out the significance of the affected tissue biopsy, which may uncover the different disease phenotypes."
16629,1747,"To this end, treatment with anti-CD20, acting at the crossroads of the pathogenetic mechanisms of both diseases may serve as a first choice therapy."
16630,1748,"The main purpose of this study was to determine the expression of interleukins-17/-23 (ILs-17/-23) and receptors of interleukins-17/-23 (IL-17R, IL-23R) in minor salivary glands (MSGs) of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
16631,1748,"Expression of IL-17, IL-23 and receptors of IL-17/-23 was analyzed in MSGs from 25 patients with pSS, 25 patients with probable preclinical pSS, and 25 patients with nonautoimmune sicca syndrome by immunohistochemistry."
16632,1748,"Comparison of the expression of IL-17, IL-23 and receptors of IL-17, IL-23 in MSG of patients with pSS with probable preclinical pSS, and with nonautoimmune sicca syndrome showed significant differences between three groups."
16633,1748,"However, the expression of IL-17, IL-23 and receptors of IL-17/-23 in MSG was comparable in pSS and probable preclinical pSS patients."
16634,1748,We did not find correlation between the expression of IL-17 and IL-23 and of IL-17R and IL-23R in patients with pSS.
16635,1748,These results demonstrate an involvement of IL-17/-23 system in the early pSS pathogenesis.
16636,1749,BACKGROUND Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare disorder that was previously described as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy.
16637,1749,"The disease is derived from overproduction of monocytes, which play an important role in immunity."
16638,1749,The overproduction of macrophages will lead to accumulation of the cells in the affected tissue.
16639,1749,CASE REPORT A 40-year-old Saudi male presented with shortness of breath with joint pain starting 3 months prior.
16640,1749,"His main complaints were a dry cough, bilateral neck swelling, dry mouth, dry skin, itchy eyes, and general fatigability."
16641,1749,"Physical examination showed that the patient had prominent bilateral parotid swelling that measured roughly 5 by 3 cm, which was firm and tender, with a smooth surface and no local signs of inflammation."
16642,1749,"Joint examination revealed non-tender and non-swollen joints, with mild limitations of movement."
16643,1749,Eye examination revealed dry eyes after having a positive Schirmer test.
16644,1749,"For diagnosis, the patient underwent complete blood count, autoantibody, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and radiological assessment."
16645,1749,The histopathological study confirmed Rosai-Dorfman disease.
16646,1749,"Rosai-Dorfman disease can involve various presentations, as in this patient, who exhibited a highly unusual presentation in association with autoimmune disease."
16647,1749,"CONCLUSIONS Rosai-Dorfman disease must be considered as differential diagnosis in patients who present with bilateral lymphadenopathy with multisystem complaints, as the disease can present with various characteristics."
16648,1750,"Follicular helper T cells (Tfh), which play a pivotal role in B cell activation and differentiation in lymphoid structures, secrete IL-21 whose augmented secretion is a hallmark of several autoimmune diseases."
16649,1750,"To decipher the cellular and molecular interactions occurring in salivary glands of patients suffering from primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), we investigated whether salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs) were capable to induce Tfh differentiation."
16650,1750,Co-cultures of nave CD4(+) T cells and SGECs from both patients with pSS and controls were performed.
16651,1750,"Here, we report that IL-6 and ICOSL expression by SGECs contributes to nave CD4(+) T differentiation into Tfh cells, as evidenced by their acquisition of a specific phenotype, characterized by Bcl-6, ICOS and CXCR5 expression and IL-21 secretion, but also but by their main functional feature: the capacity to enhance B lymphocytes survival."
16652,1750,We demonstrated an increase of serum IL-21 with systemic activity.
16653,1750,"Finally, we analyzed the potential occurrence of a genetic association between IL-21 or IL-21R gene polymorphisms and pSS or elevated IL-21 secretion."
16654,1750,"This study, which demonstrates a direct induction of Tfh differentiation by SGECs, emphasizes a yet unknown pathogenic role of SGECs and suggests that Tfh and IL-21 might be relevant biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets in primary Sjgren's syndrome."
16655,1751,OBJECTIVES: ACA-positive/primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) represents a distinct overlapping entity with intermediate features in between limited systemic sclerosis (lSSc) and pSS.
16656,1751,"Few data are available on their general risk for lymphoproliferative complications, specifically regarding adverse predictors at the level of minor salivary gland (MSG) histology."
16657,1751,"The objectives of this work are: a) to characterise, through a detailed immunohistochemistry study, the organisation of the lymphomonocitic infiltrates in ACA-positive/pSS patient vs. ACA-negative/pSS patients focusing on the presence of GC-like structures in minor salivary gland biopsies; b) to compare the frequency of traditional clinical and serological risk factors for lymphoma between the two subgroups."
16658,1751,"METHODS: We analysed 28 MSG samples from ACA-positive/pSS patients and 43 consecutive MSGs from ACA-negative/pSS, using sequential IHC staining for CD3, CD20 and CD21 in order to define the T/B cell segregation within the periductal infiltrates and presence of ectopic GC-like on the detection of GC-like structures."
16659,1751,Clinical and serological data of all the patients were retrieved and analysed.
16660,1751,RESULTS: Ectopic lymphoid structures (ELS) with GC-like structures were observed in 7 out of 28 ACA-positive/pSS patients (25%) and in 13 out of 43 ACA-negative/pSS patients (30.2%).
16661,1751,"Similarly, no statistical significant difference was found between the two groups as far as the classical pSS risk factors for lymphoproliferative complications was concerned (i.e."
16662,1751,"salivary gland enlargement, purpura, low C4, leukocytopenia, clonal gammopathy)."
16663,1751,"Finally, the 3 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma observed were equally distributed between the two subsets."
16664,1751,"CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study indicates that ACA-positive/and ACA-negative pSS patients apparently present a similar risk for lymphoproliferative complications as suggested indirectly by the analogies between the two groups observed at the histopathology level."
16665,1752,"OX40L (CD252, TNFSF4), a type II transmembrane protein which like other tumor necrosis factor ligands, involved in the costimulation and differentiation of T cells, functions as a positive signal in immune response."
16666,1752,"To investigate the biological function of soluble OX40L (sOX40L), three functional anti-OX40L monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 3D2, 3F7 and 2H3 were obtained by hybridoma technology."
16667,1752,"Besides, specificity of the mAbs was further demonstrated by ELISA, Western blot and Immunofluorescence experiments."
16668,1752,We also developed a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on two anti-human OX40L antibodies 3D2 and 3F7 with different epitopes.
16669,1752,"Using the ELISA system, we found that sOX40L in the sera of healthy donors increases in an age-dependent manner and that enhanced sOX40L expression in some autoimmune diseases especially in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, suggesting the potential diagnostic significance of sOX40L in the autoimmune diseases."
16670,1752,"Together, these data demonstrate that the existence of circulating sOX40L in human sera might play an important role in immunoregulation."
16671,1753,INTRODUCTION: Anti-Ro antibodies can be found in the serum of the majority of patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
16672,1753,Immunization with a 60-kDa Ro peptide has been shown to induce SS-like symptoms in mice.
16673,1753,The aim of this study was to investigate factors involved in salivary gland (SG) dysfunction after immunization and to test whether the induction of SS could be improved.
16674,1753,"METHODS: Ro60 peptide immunization was tested in Balb/c mice, multiple antigenic peptide (MAP)-Ro60 and Pertussis toxin (PTX) were tested in SJL/J mice."
16675,1753,"In addition, two injection sites were compared in these two strains: the abdominal area and the tailbase."
16676,1753,"Each group of mice was tested for a loss of SG function, SG lymphocytic infiltration, anti-Ro and anti-La antibody formation, and cytokine production in cultured cells or homogenized SG extracts."
16677,1753,"RESULTS: Ro60 peptide immunization in the abdominal area of female Balb/c mice led to impaired SG function, which corresponded with increased Th1 cytokines (IFN- and IL-12) systemically and locally in the SG."
16678,1753,"Moreover, changing the immunization conditions to MAP-Ro60 in the abdominal area, and to lesser extend in the tailbase, also led to impaired SG function in SJL/J mice."
16679,1753,"As was seen in the Balb/c mice, increased IFN- in the SG draining lymph nodes accompanied the SG dysfunction."
16680,1753,"However, no correlation was observed with anti-MAP-Ro60 antibody titers, and there was no additional effect on disease onset or severity."
16681,1753,CONCLUSIONS: Effective induction of salivary gland dysfunction after Ro60 peptide immunization depended on the site of injection.
16682,1753,Disease induction was not affected by changing the immunization conditions.
16683,1753,"However, of interest is that the mechanism of action of Ro60 peptide immunization appears to involve an increase in Th1 cytokines, resulting in the induction of SG dysfunction."
16684,1754,Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) constitute a family of auto-antibodies directed against various components of the neutrophil cytoplasm.
16685,1754,The indirect immunofluorecence assays detected three fluorescent staining patterns: cANCA--cytoplasmic; pANCA--perinuclear and aANCA--atypical.
16686,1754,"Occurence ANCA is mainly associated with Wegener's granulomatosis and vasculitis, but they are also detected in autoimmune diseases (eg."
16687,1754,"in systemic lupus erythematosus, in rheumathoid arthritis, Sjgren's syndrome, in dermatomyositis) and in inflamatory bowel diseases (Crohn disease, colitis ulcerosa)."
16688,1754,"Presence of ANCA was found also in primary sclerosing cholangitis, in chronic infections and in person using some kinds of drugs."
16689,1754,The aim of the study was to review recent investigations concerning prevalence of ANCA and their diagnostic value not only for vasculitis but also for the other disease in which they are detected.
16690,1755,PURPOSE: To determine the causes of lacrimal gland inflammation based on histopathology and systemic evaluation.
16691,1755,METHODS: This is a retrospective case series study.
16692,1755,"From the University of British Columbia Orbit Clinic between January 1976 and December 2008, we reviewed the medical records of 60 patients who presented with inflammatory features of the lacrimal gland (i.e., erythema, edema, or tenderness) in which the diagnoses were not possible clinically and on imaging alone."
16693,1755,"As was our routine practice, all these patients underwent lacrimal gland biopsy before starting any treatment."
16694,1755,"RESULTS: The histopathologic findings of the 60 patients showed that 37 (61.7%) had identifiable types of lacrimal inflammation including 10 with Sjogren's syndrome, seven with sarcoidal reaction, six with feature of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis), five with lymphoma, two with sclerosing inflammation, two with IgG4-related dacryoadenitis, and one patient each with infectious dacryoadenitis, myoepithelial carcinoma, xanthogranuloma, eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis, and eosinophilic allergic granulomatous nodule."
16695,1755,The histopathologic findings of the remaining 23 (38.3%) patients showed nonspecific inflammation of the lacrimal gland.
16696,1755,23 patients (38.3%) had associated systemic diseases.
16697,1755,48 patients (80%) were treated successfully and 10 (16.7%) had recurrence of inflammation.
16698,1755,"CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that in patients presenting with lacrimal gland inflammation (i.e., erythema, edema, tenderness) in which the specific diagnosis cannot be made clinically and on imaging, biopsy is warranted for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment."
16699,1755,"We found that the majority of these patients (61.7%) had specific histopathology, and 38% had systemic diseases."
16700,1756,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism underlying the changes in the cardiac function in rat models of Sjogren's syndrome (SS) based on Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-Nrf2/ARE signaling pathways.
16701,1756,"METHODS: Thirty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups, normal control (NC) group and SS model group, with 15 in each."
16702,1756,The rats in the model group were injected with the complete Freund's adjuvant plus homologous antigen of submandibular gland (0.2 mL mixture) into bilateral posterior paw metatarsus.
16703,1756,"The body mass, water intake, submandibular gland index, spleen index, and histological changes of the glands were observed 30 days after inflammation was induced."
16704,1756,Cardiac function was assessed using invasive hemodynamic monitoring.
16705,1756,"Meanwhile, reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), IL-18, IL-35 were detected using ELISA; ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), glutathione (GSH), thioredoxin (TrX) protein were determined using immunohistochemical staining."
16706,1756,"The expressions of Keap 1, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2), macrophage activating factor (Maf) antioxidant responsive element (ARE) mRNAs were detected using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR); the levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), -glutamic acid and a half long glycine synthetase (-GCS) proteins in cardiac tissue were examined using Western blotting."
16707,1756,"RESULTS: Compared with the NC group, the model group presented reduced body mass, submandibular gland index and spleen index (P<0.05), increased water intake (P<0.01), heart rate (HR), heart index (HI), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) and left ventricular diastolic pressure (LVEDP) (P<0.05), and decreased left ventricular dp/dtmax (P<0.05)."
16708,1756,"Compared with the NC group, the model group had increased IL-18, MDA, RNS, TAC, ROS levels, and Keap1, Maf, Nfr2 mRNAs, HO-1, -GCS protein expressions in the heart tissue, while TrX, GSH, IL-5 and SOD levels decreased significantly (P<0.01)."
16709,1756,"CONCLUSION: The immune imbalance in SS rats may be related with the up-regulated levels of Keap1, Maf, Nfr2 mRNAs, HO-1, -GCS."
16710,1757,A 49-year-old woman with a 20-year history of Sjgren's syndrome (SS) was incidentally found to have an abnormal chest X-ray along with dyspnea and desaturation.
16711,1757,"Chest CT findings showed multiple cystic shadows, ground glass opacity, and small nodule-like lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP), which have been previously reported."
16712,1757,She was diagnosed by surgical lung biopsy to have mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.
16713,1757,It was difficult to detect the presence of lymphoma by the use of only CT findings.
16714,1757,Pulmonary involvement of SS occurs in various forms so that SS patients with pulmonary involvement should undergo open biopsy to reach a definitive diagnosis.
16715,1758,"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory demyelinating autoimmune disease with severe, tremendously incapacitating, consequences in the patient's health and wellbeing."
16716,1758,"Until 2004, NMO was considered a restricted type of multiple sclerosis but in the same year an auto-antibody reacting against aquaporin-4 (NMO-IgG) was found to be related with NMO and it was considered the main etiologic agent of this disease."
16717,1758,Its detection is very sensitive and specific allowing an early diagnosis and a better treatment and prognosis.
16718,1758,"With this tool, a spectrum of diseases including other autoimmune diseases was found to have NMO-IgG antibodies and a new classification named NMO spectrum disorders was created."
16719,1758,"In this review, we sum up the developments in this field associated with other autoimmune diseases."
16720,1758,We approach the latest discoveries in the diagnosis like the new biomarkers that will possibly be used in the close future or the developments in the neuroimaging techniques.
16721,1758,We reviewed the literature and synthesized case reports of NMO patients with concurrent autoimmune diseases and the information from useful larger studies.
16722,1758,"Finally, we summarize the commonly used treatments in NMO and we try to specify the best treatment for NMO with simultaneous autoimmune disease."
16723,1758,This review updates the information about this issue and raises the awareness of rheumatologists for these severe diseases.
16724,1759,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease with mononuclear cell infiltration and destruction of the lacrimal gland and salivary glands, which cause dryness of the eyes and mouth."
16725,1759,The most common neurological condition seen in SS is peripheral neuropathy.
16726,1759,Initial manifestation of SS as an acute fulminant peripheral neuropathy is extremely rare.
16727,1759,We report a 42-year-old patient presenting with acute motor sensory-axonal neuropathy in the presence of SS.
16728,1759,She showed partial response to intravenous immunoglobulin but favourable clinical improvement was seen after initiation of corticosteroid treatment.
16729,1760,"OBJECTIVES: It has been recently observed that a T-cell subset, lacking of both CD4 and CD8 molecules and defined as double negative (DN), is expanded in the blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, produces IL-17 and accumulates in the kidney during nephritis."
16730,1760,"Since IL-17 production is enhanced in salivary gland infiltrates of primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) patients, we investigated whether DN T cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of salivary gland damage."
16731,1760,METHODS: Phenotypic characterisation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SS patients and controls was performed by flow cytometry in freshly isolated and anti-CD3-stimulated cells.
16732,1760,SS minor salivary glands were processed for immunofluorescence staining.
16733,1760,RESULTS: CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) DN T cells were major producers of IL-17 in SS and expressed ROR-t.
16734,1760,"They were expanded in the peripheral blood, spontaneously produced IL-17 and infiltrated salivary glands."
16735,1760,"In addition, the expansion of -TCR(+) DN T cells was associated with disease activity."
16736,1760,"Notably, IL-17-producing DN T cells from SS patients, but not from healthy controls, were strongly resistant to the in vitro effect of dexamethasone."
16737,1760,"CONCLUSIONS: These findings appear to be of great interest since the identification of a peculiar T-cell subset with pro-inflammatory activity, but resistant to corticosteroids, in an autoimmune disorder such as SS may help to design new specific treatments for the disease."
16738,1761,Systemic inflammation may be a common process that underpins both atherosclerosis and extra-articular features (ExRA) of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
16739,1761,We evaluated the relationship between ExRA and arterial dysfunction in 114 consecutive patients with RA (82% women) without overt arterial disease aged 40-65years.
16740,1761,"A trained research nurse undertook 'SphygmoCor' pulse wave analysis (PWA) using radial applanation tonometry to measure the extent (augmentation index, AIX%) and timing (reflected wave transit time, RWT, msec) of aortic wave reflection."
16741,1761,"Assessment included fasting blood sample, patient questionnaire and medical record review."
16742,1761,"Mean differences were adjusted for age, sex, mean blood pressure, smoking pack-years, fasting cholesterol, Stanford HAQ score and erythrocyte sedimentation rate."
16743,1761,Mean age was 54 (SD 7) and median RA duration 10 (IQR 4-17) years.
16744,1761,"There was a trend for arterial dysfunction (higher AIX%; lower RWT) to increase as the number of ExRA features rose, but no difference in AIX% (-0.5, 95%CI -2.8 to 1.8, P=0.65) or RWT (0.3ms, 95%CI -3.6 to 4.2, P=0.86) between 'any ExRA' and 'no ExRA'."
16745,1761,"Arterial dysfunction was not associated with the presence of rheumatoid nodules, Sjogren's syndrome or carpal tunnel syndrome."
16746,1761,"Our study was too small to determine whether severe ('Malmo') ExRA (vasculitis, pericarditis, episcleritis) was truly associated with a higher AIX% (3.8, 95%CI -2.3 to 9.9, P=0.22) and lower RWT (-5.5ms 95%CI -13.1 to 2.1, P=0.16)."
16747,1761,"While arterial dysfunction may be associated with the number of ExRA features and severe ExRA, it does not appear to be associated with other ExRA features."
16748,1762,OBJECTIVES: Labial salivary glands (LSGs) of SS patients show alterations related to endoplasmic reticulum stress.
16749,1762,"Glandular dysfunction could be partly the consequence of an altered inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)/X box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1) signalling pathway of the unfolded protein response, which then regulates genes involved in biogenesis of the secretory machinery."
16750,1762,"This study aimed to determine the expression, promoter methylation and localization of the IRE1/XBP-1 pathway components in LSGs of SS patients and also their expression induced by IFN- in vitro."
16751,1762,"METHODS: IRE1, XBP-1 and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) mRNA and protein levels were measured by qPCR and western blot, respectively, in LSGs of SS patients (n = 47) and control subjects (n = 37)."
16752,1762,"Methylation of promoters was evaluated by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting, localization was analysed by immunofluorescence and induction of the IRE1/XBP-1 pathway components by IFN- was evaluated in 3D acini."
16753,1762,"RESULTS: A significant decrease of IRE1, XBP-1u, XBP-1s, total XBP-1 and GRP78 mRNAs was observed in LSGs of SS patients, which was correlated with increased methylation levels of their respective promoters, and consistently the protein levels for IRE1, XBP-1s and GRP78 were observed to decrease."
16754,1762,"IFN- decreased the mRNA and protein levels of XBP-1s, IRE1 and GRP78, and increased methylation of their promoters."
16755,1762,Significant correlations were also found between IRE1/XBP-1 pathway components and clinical parameters.
16756,1762,"CONCLUSION: Decreased mRNA levels for IRE1, XBP-1 and GRP78 can be partially explained by hypermethylation of their promoters and is consistent with chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress, which may explain the glandular dysfunction observed in LSGs of SS patients."
16757,1762,"Additionally, glandular stress signals, including IFN-, could modulate the expression of the IRE1/XBP-1 pathway components."
16758,1763,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic rheumatic autoimmune disease affecting the exocrine glandular function and is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against the ribonucleoprotein particles, SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La, and mononuclear cell infiltration of exocrine tissues."
16759,1763,"Our aim is to characterize memory B cell pattern and function in relation to the progression of the disease, by analysing samples from a well-defined cohort of patients with primary SS."
16760,1763,We have measured the number of Ro/La-specific plasma cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 23 patients and 20 healthy controls by direct enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay.
16761,1763,"Furthermore, we quantified the Ro- and La-specific memory B cells in these individuals by a 6-day in vitro polyclonal stimulation of PBMC followed by an antigen-specific ELISPOT assay for the detection of memory B cells."
16762,1763,"In addition to this, ELISA profiling of autoantibodies was carried out using patients' plasma and supernatant, collected post-mitogen stimulation of PBMC."
16763,1763,"The average Ro60-, Ro52- and La48-specific plasma cells in PB was 9, 17 and 13 cells in 10(5) PBMC, respectively."
16764,1763,"After in vitro stimulation, these numbers increased to 43, 50 and 26 for Ro60, Ro52 and La48, correspondingly."
16765,1763,"However, the fraction of memory B cells activated into antibody-secreting cells was lower than the overall IgG B cell population."
16766,1763,We conclude that these lower Ro/La-specific memory B cell levels may indicate that a greater portion of the Ro- and La-specific B cells are in an activated stage.
16767,1763,This is in tune with previous reports.
16768,1764,INTRODUCTION: We investigated the effects of maternal autoimmune disease and fetal congenital heart block (CHB) on pregnancy outcomes in anti-Ro/SSA-positive women and assessed the population-based incidence of isolated CHB.
16769,1764,MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and ninety nine anti-Ro/SSA-positive pregnancies were prospectively followed at our center (2000-2013).
16770,1764,Seven fetuses developed atrioventricular block (AVB) II-III.
16771,1764,"In this period, another 13 anti-Ro/SSA-positive pregnancies were referred for fetal bradycardia, subsequently diagnosed with AVB II-III."
16772,1764,"Cesarean section rates, gestational age, body measurements at birth, and the incidence of CHB in these 212 pregnancies were analyzed in relation to fetal atrioventricular conduction and maternal diagnosis and compared with data from the Medical Birth Registry on 352,104 pregnancies in the Stockholm County."
16773,1764,RESULTS: The prevalence of maternal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjgren's syndrome and the outcomes at birth were similar in normal conduction and AVB I cases.
16774,1764,"Only 1/20 AVB II-III cases (0/7 in the surveillance group) had a mother diagnosed with SLE, compared with 73/192 in cases with normal conduction or AVB I."
16775,1764,"Excluding cases with AVB II-III, SLE mothers more frequently delivered by cesarean section (31% vs. 20%, p < 0.05) and had a higher incidence of preterm birth (13% vs. 5.8%, p < 0.05) than the county population."
16776,1764,"Both SLE and primary Sjgren's syndrome mothers had a fourfold greater rate of growth-retarded babies (10.11% vs. 2.2%, p < 0.001)."
16777,1764,The incidence of autoantibody-related AVB II-III in Stockholm County was 1/23 300.
16778,1764,"CONCLUSION: This study of CHB provides new information on the incidence of CHB and outcome of pregnancy in anti-Ro/SSA-positive women, which has clinical relevance when counseling rheumatic patients considering pregnancy."
16779,1765,Autoimmune myelofibrosis is a distinct clinicopathological entity that occurs with autoimmune disorders.
16780,1765,"We report the case of a 44-year-old woman admitted with pancytopenia and clinical features of systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome and antiphospholipid antibodies syndrome."
16781,1765,"Bone marrow biopsy showed decreased global cells and an increase of reticulin fibres on argentic coloration, consistent with myelofibrosis."
16782,1765,"The JAK2 V617, Myeloproliferative leukemia (MPL) and calreticulin mutations were negative."
16783,1765,"The patient's condition improved after treatment with hydroxychloroquine, vitamin K antagonists and prednisone."
16784,1766,PURPOSE: The objective was to provide preliminary information about the efficacy and safety of immunologically safe plasma rich in growth factor (immunosafe PRGF) eye drops in the treatment of moderate to severe dry eye in patients with primary and secondary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and to analyze the influence of several variables on treatment outcomes.
16785,1766,METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with SS.
16786,1766,All patients were treated with previously immunosafe PRGF eye drops to reduce the immunologic component contents.
16787,1766,"Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scale, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), visual analog scale (VAS) frequency, and VAS severity outcome measures were evaluated before and after treatment with immunosafe PRGF."
16788,1766,The potential influence of some patient clinical variables on results was also assessed.
16789,1766,Safety assessment was also performed reporting all adverse events.
16790,1766,"RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (12 patients with primary SS, and 14 patients suffering secondary SS) with a total of 52 affected eyes were included and evaluated."
16791,1766,"Immunosafe PRGF treatment showed a significant reduction (P<0.05) in OSDI scale (41.86%), in BCVA (62.97%), in VAS frequency (34.75%), and in VAS severity (41.50%)."
16792,1766,BCVA and VAS frequency scores improved significantly (P<0.05) after concomitant treatment of PRGF with corticosteroids.
16793,1766,Only 2 adverse events were reported in 2 patients (7.7% of patients).
16794,1766,CONCLUSIONS: Signs and symptoms of dry eye syndrome in patients with SS were reduced after treatment with PRGF-Endoret eye drops.
16795,1766,Immunosafe PRGF-Endoret is safe and effective for treating patients with primary and secondary SS.
16796,1767,A 62-year-old woman was diagnosed with severe osteomalacia caused by renal tubular acidosis associated with Sjgren's syndrome.
16797,1767,"She was treated with sodium bicarbonate, risedronate, alfacalcidol, and prednisolone (1 mg/kg)."
16798,1767,"By 24 months, renal tubular acidosis was improved and the bone density had normalized."
16799,1767,"Here we report the successful amelioration of bone lesions through a multidisciplinary approach that improved renal tubular acidosis, with a special focus on treatment of the underlying inflammatory disorder with glucocorticoids."
16800,1768,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the presence of microRNAs (miRNAs) within exosomes isolated from human saliva and to optimize and test methods for successful downstream applications.
16801,1768,DESIGN: Exosomes isolated from fresh and frozen glandular and whole human saliva were used as a source of miRNAs.
16802,1768,The presence of miRNAs was validated with TaqMan quantitative PCR and miRNA microarrays.
16803,1768,RESULTS: We successfully isolated exosomes from human saliva from healthy controls and a patient with Sjgren's syndrome.
16804,1768,microRNAs extracted from the exosomal fraction were sufficient for quantitative PCR and microarray profiling.
16805,1768,CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of miRNAs from easily and non-invasively obtained salivary exosomes with subsequent characterization of the miRNA expression patterns is promising for the development of future biomarkers of the diagnosis and prognosis of various salivary gland pathologies.
16806,1769,Studies on vasculitis in black Africa are rare.
16807,1769,"The purpose of this report is to describe a retrospective study of systemic vasculitis managed in the internal medicine, ORL and cardiolology departments of the Aristide le Dantec University Hospital in Dakar, Senegal from 1995 to 2007."
16808,1769,A series of 27 cases involving 7 men and 20 women with a mean age of 49 years was compiled.
16809,1769,"Primary vasculitis included Horton disease in 3 cases, Wegener disease in 2, Takayasu disease in 1, and Buerger disease in 1."
16810,1769,"Secondary vasculitis included mixed cryoglobulinemia with Gougerot Sjgren syndrome in 7 cases, primary Goujert syndrome in 4, rheumatoid arthritis in 3, nodosa periarteritis with hepatitis B in 2, SHARP syndrome in 1, and polymyositis in 1."
16811,1769,The remaining two cases involved abdominal periaortitis including one associated with retrosperitoneal fibrosis and tuberculosis and the other with spondylarthropathy.
16812,1769,"Corticotherapy in combination with anticoagulants, immunosuppressive therapy, and surgery, when necessary, allowed effective management in 24 cases."
16813,1769,The findings of this study show that systemic vasculitis can have numerous etiologies and indicate that secondary forms are the most common.
16814,1769,Appropriate care modalities are needed to prevent severe outcome in Senegalese hospitals.
16815,1770,BACKGROUND: Comparisons of lung manifestations in primary pulmonary vs disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial disease have not been well described.
16816,1770,"The clinical, histopathologic, and radiologic disease manifestations of primary pulmonary or disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial disease were compared in an autopsy series."
16817,1770,"METHODS: Medical and microbiologic records, autopsy reports, histopathologic slides of the lungs, and chest CT scans were reviewed on patients at the National Institutes of Health with nontuberculous mycobacterial disease who died between 1996 and 2010."
16818,1770,"RESULTS: The 11 patients with primary pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial disease were predominantly female (n = 9), with symptom onset at median 50 (range 35, 71) years and time from onset until death of 12 (3, 34) years."
16819,1770,Bronchiectasis with cavity formation and necrotizing bronchocentric granulomatous inflammation predominated but extrapulmonary infection was absent.
16820,1770,"The five patients with disseminated disease and systemic immune defects were all men with age at onset of 2 (0.33, 33) years and time from onset of disease until death of 9 (1, 31) years."
16821,1770,Miliary nodules and/or consolidation with poorly formed granulomatous inflammation were noted in the three disseminated patients with mycobacterial lung involvement.
16822,1770,Significant extrapulmonary infection was noted in all five with a relative paucity of lung findings.
16823,1770,"CONCLUSIONS: Nontuberculous mycobacteria can cause progressive, fatal disease."
16824,1770,Primary pulmonary disease is bronchocentric and lacks extrathoracic infection consistent with impaired airway surface defenses.
16825,1770,"In contrast, fatal disseminated infections involving the lung have hematogenous spread, extensive extrathoracic disease, and a distinct pulmonary histopathology consistent with systemic immune dysfunction."
16826,1771,"Patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome, a systemic autoimmune disease, have been shown to have serum autoantibodies that react with the muscarinic acetylcholine type 3 receptor (M3R).Primary Sjgren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease."
16827,1771,Patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome have been shown to have serum autoantibodies that react with the muscarinic acetylcholine type 3 receptor (M3R).
16828,1771,Leukopenia has been reported to be significantly more common in primary Sjgren's syndrome patients who have anti-M3R-autoantibodies in their sera.
16829,1771,"In this study, we investigated whether these anti-M3R autoantibodies have effects on M3R and MHCI expression in Jurkat T cells."
16830,1771,Purified IgG antibodies were isolated from the serum of healthy individuals and primary Sjgren's syndrome patients.
16831,1771,Jurkat cell line was used to represent T lymphocytes.
16832,1771,In situ immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was used to confirm the binding reactivity of primary Sjgren's syndrome IgG antibodies to M3R.
16833,1771,"Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence results suggested a direct interaction between M3R and MHC I. Co-internalization of M3R and MHC I was observed when Jurkat cells were exposed to the primary Sjgren's syndrome IgG, but this primary Sjgren's syndrome IgG-induced co-internalization of M3R and MHC I was prevented by the presence of exogenous IFN-."
16834,1771,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome IgG itself did not affect the viability of Jurkat cells, but Jurkat cells exposed to primary Sjgren's syndrome IgG were observed to undergo significant cell death when co-cultured with primary Natural Killer cells."
16835,1771,Our results suggest that anti-M3R autoantibodies in primary Sjgren's syndrome induce downregulation of plasma membrane-resident M3R and MHC class I molecules in leukocytes followed by NK cell-mediated cell death.
16836,1771,This mechanism may explain the frequency of leukopenia occurrence in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome.
16837,1772,"The immune responses to antigens from different stages of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) life cycle were investigated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjgren's syndrome (SS), and systemic sclerosis (SSc) to gain knowledge of EBV's involvement in the etiology of systemic autoimmune diseases (SADs) and for an overview of the humoral immune responses against EBV."
16838,1772,Investigations were performed by the use of ELISA.
16839,1772,"IgM, IgA, and IgG antibody binding to 11 EBV antigens: EBNA1, EBNA2, BALF5, EAD, BALF2, EA/R, VCA p18, VCA p23, gB, gp350, and gp42 were examined in serum pools from SAD patients and healthy controls (HCs)."
16840,1772,Increased antibody levels against the 11 EBV antigens in the SAD pools were seen compared to the HC pool.
16841,1772,"Specifically, SLE was characterized by strongly increased IgA to EAD both compared to HCs and other SADs, and RA was characterized by increased IgM levels to several EBV antigens."
16842,1772,The SADs may be partly distinguished by their differential immune responses to various antigens in the EBV life cycle.
16843,1772,"All together, these findings support an association between EBV infection and SADs."
16844,1773,OBJECTIVES: Autoantibodies reactive with Ro52 are often found in sera of patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
16845,1773,This study was undertaken to investigate the role of Ro52-induced immune responses in pathogenesis of SS.
16846,1773,METHODS: New Zealand Mixed (NZM) 2758 mice were immunised with Ro52 in alum adjuvant.
16847,1773,Control mice were immunised either with maltose-binding protein or injected with alum alone.
16848,1773,"Mice were monitored for anti-Ro52 antibody, sialoadenitis and pilocarpine-induced salivation."
16849,1773,Antibody binding to salivary gland (SG) cells was analysed in vivo and in vitro by immunofluorescence.
16850,1773,Sera from immunised mice were passively transferred into untreated or alum injected NZM2758 mice.
16851,1773,"RESULTS: By day 30 post-immunisation, Ro52 immunised mice generated immunoprecipitating anti-Ro52 antibodies and they had the maximum drop in saliva production."
16852,1773,Both Ro52 immunised and control mice showed evidence of mild sialoadenitis.
16853,1773,"However, only Ro52 immunised mice had antibody deposition in their SG."
16854,1773,"Passive transfer of Ro52-immune sera induced SG dysfunction in recipient mice, only if the recipients were primed with alum."
16855,1773,"In vitro, antibodies from Ro52-immune sera were internalised by a SG cell line and this uptake was inhibited by cytochalasin D treatment."
16856,1773,"CONCLUSIONS: Our data show for the first time that antibodies induced by Ro52 are capable of inducing SG dysfunction, and that this phenomenon is dependent on the activation of innate immunity."
16857,1773,The mouse model described in this study implies that autoantibody deposition in the SG might be an important step in the induction of xerostomia and pathogenesis of SS.
16858,1774,The purpose of the present study was to investigate the differences in salivary flow rates and dry mouth-related subjective symptoms and behaviours in patients with xerostomia according to its aetiology.
16859,1774,"One hundred and forty patients (24 men and 116 women, mean age, 58.1 +/- 13.3 years) with a chief complaint of xerostomia were included."
16860,1774,"The patients were divided into five groups; Sjgren's syndrome (n = 34), post-radiation therapy in the head and neck region (n = 16), antipsychotic medications (n = 30), systemic diseases or medications affecting salivary flow (n = 35), and unknown aetiology (n = 25)."
16861,1774,"The patients were asked a standardized series of questions concerning dry mouth, and their whole salivary flow rates were measured."
16862,1774,Patients with a history of radiation therapy displayed the most decreased values of salivary flow rates and the most severe associated symptoms and behaviours while patients with unknown aetiology displayed the least decreased values of salivary flow rates and relatively favourable symptoms and behaviours.
16863,1774,A burning sensation in the mouth was the most prevalent in patients with systemic diseases or those who were taking medications while altered taste perception was the most prevalent in patients taking antipsychotics.
16864,1774,"In conclusion, patients with xerostomia displayed various degrees of discomfort related to the quality of life according to the aetiology of their conditions."
16865,1775,The Diffuse Infiltrative Lymphocytosis Syndrome (DILS) is a rare multisystemic syndrome described in HIV-infected patients.
16866,1775,It is characterised by CD8(+) T-cell lymphocytosis associated with a CD8(+) T-cell infiltration of multiple organs.
16867,1775,DILS is usually seen in uncontrolled or untreated HIV infection but can also manifest itself independently of CD4(+) T-cell counts.
16868,1775,"The syndrome may present as a Sjgren-like disease that generally associates sicca signs with bilateral parotiditis, lymphadenopathy, and extraglandular organ involvement."
16869,1775,"The latter may affect the lungs, nervous system, liver, kidneys, and digestive tract."
16870,1775,Anomalies of the respiratory system are often identified as lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia.
16871,1775,"Facial nerve palsy, aseptic meningitis or polyneuropathy are among the more frequent neurological features."
16872,1775,"Hepatic lymphocytic infiltration, lymphocytic interstitial nephropathy and digestive tract lymphocytic infiltration account for more rarely noted complications."
16873,1775,"Sicca syndrome, organomegaly and/or organ dysfunction associated with polyclonal CD8(+) T-cell organ-infiltration are greatly suggestive of DILS in people living with HIV."
16874,1775,Labial salivary gland biopsy is therefore helpful when the focus score is equal or greater than 1 (or Chisholm Score3).
16875,1775,"Primary Sjgren syndrome, chronic HCV or HTLV1 infection, graft versus host disease, IgG4-related disease, and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome are among the differential diagnoses that need to be considered."
16876,1775,"Treatment consists in highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), which is usually effective in resolving clinical signs and symptoms."
16877,1775,"Steroids, however, may also be occasionally required when organ infiltration does not respond to HAART."
16878,1775,This review should provide an insight into this rare entity complicating the course of HIV infection.
16879,1776,The ocular surface is a frequent target tissue of mucosal chronic GVHD (cGVHD).
16880,1776,We investigated the histopathological features of the conjunctival microvilli in patients with cGVHD.
16881,1776,"Conjunctival tissue specimens from patients with cGVHD or Sjgren's syndrome (SS) or from healthy individuals were examined by light microscopy and EM, impression cytology, and immunohistochemistry."
16882,1776,The cGVHD conjunctivae showed significantly more metaplasia and fewer goblet cells than the SS and normal conjunctivae.
16883,1776,Abundant CD8(+) T cells infiltrated the basal epithelia in the cGVHD conjunctiva.
16884,1776,The microvilli per standard epithelial unit and the secretory vesicles were counted by analyzing electron micrographs.
16885,1776,"The mean number of mucosal microvilli was significantly lower in the cGVHD than that in the SS or normal specimens, and the microvilli were significantly shorter, with a smaller height-width ratio."
16886,1776,"The mean number of secretory vesicles was also significantly lower, and the membrane-spanning mucin thinner, in the cGVHD compared with the SS and normal specimens."
16887,1776,"Thus, the conjunctival mucosal microvilli of cGVHD patients were significantly different in number and morphology from those of SS and normal subjects."
16888,1776,These may be important factors affecting the stability of the tear-film layer and its contribution to cGVHD-related dry eye.
16889,1777,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the difference of serological profile in pSS and their correlation with the clinical characteristics of parotid glands.
16890,1777,METHODS: This retrospective study includes 289 patients who fulfilled the 2002 American-European Consensus Group Criteria for pSS.
16891,1777,"The patients were categorized by the clinical features of parotid glands: Group 1 (massive group), Group 2 (infection group), Group 3 (swelling group) and Group 4 (others)."
16892,1777,The demographic data and serological profiles among these groups were compared.
16893,1777,"Statistical analyses of the results between groups were performed using the Student t test, Fisher's exact test, chi-square and analysis of variance."
16894,1777,RESULTS: There was a difference of serological profile in the different clinical characteristics of parotid glands of pSS.
16895,1777,"Serum Ig G value of Group 1 was the greatest, and complement C4 was lowest in the four groups."
16896,1777,Serum Ig E value of Group 2 was the greatest and ESR of Group 3 was the greatest in the four groups.
16897,1777,"CONCLUSION: This study has determined the differences of serological profile in the different clinical features of parotid glands of pSS patients, which may help advance our understanding of the disease and improve patient management."
16898,1778,"BACKGROUND: To assess the risk of incident cardiovascular disease in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome, overall and stratified by Ro/SSA and La/SSB autoantibody status."
16899,1778,"METHODS: A cohort of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome in Sweden (n=960) and matched controls from the general population (n=9035) were included, and data extracted from the National Patient Register to identify events of myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction and venous thromboembolism."
16900,1778,Hazard ratios were estimated using cox proportional hazard regressions.
16901,1778,"RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 9.5years, the overall hazard ratio (HR) was 1.6 (95% CI 1.2-2.1) for myocardial infarction, 1.2 (95% CI 0.9-1.7) for cerebral infarction and 2.1 (95% CI 1.6-2.9) for venous thromboembolism."
16902,1778,"Patients positive for both Ro/SSA and La/SSB autoantibodies had a substantially higher risk of cerebral infarction (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.9) and venous thromboembolism (HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.9-4.8) than the general population."
16903,1778,These risks were not significantly increased in Ro/SSA- and La/SSB-negative patients.
16904,1778,"Among autoantibody-positive patients, the highest HR of cerebral infarction was seen after 10years disease duration (HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.4-5.4), while the HR for venous thromboembolism was highest 0-5years after disease diagnosis (HR 4.7, 95% CI 2.3-9.3) and remained high throughout disease duration."
16905,1778,CONCLUSIONS: Primary Sjgren's syndrome is associated with a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular disease and the presence of Ro/SSA and La/SSB autoantibodies identify the subgroup of patients carrying the highest risk.
16906,1778,These findings suggest that monitoring and prevention of cardiovascular disease in this patient group should be considered.
16907,1779,OBJECTIVES: The higher incidence of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases cannot be attributed exclusively to traditional risk factors for CVD.
16908,1779,Antibodies to oxidised Low Density Lipoprotein (ox-LDL) seem to have a crucial role in atherogenesis.
16909,1779,"METHODS: Sera from 63 consecutive patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), 121 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 79 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 26 apparently healthy individuals were evaluated for the presence of antibodies to ox-LDL by ELISA."
16910,1779,The femoral and/or carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and plaque formation as well as traditional CVD risk factors and disease-related features were recorded for all study participants.
16911,1779,"RESUKTS: Anti-ox-LDL antibody levels were significantly reduced in SS and RA patients, but not in SLE patients, compared to their healthy counterparts."
16912,1779,"Subsequently, SS patients were divided into two groups according to antibody levels to ox-LDL, using as cut off the median of each group studied."
16913,1779,"SS patients with high titres of antibodies to ox-LDL displayed higher rates of autoantibodies to Ro/SSA and La/SSB antigens, purpura, low complement levels and increased SS activity index."
16914,1779,"On the other hand, the high anti-ox-LDL group was characterised by reduced rates of carotid and/or femoral plaque after adjusting for potential confounders (OR [95%CI]: 0.14 [0.03-0.72])."
16915,1779,Such associations were not shown in all other groups included in the study.
16916,1779,"CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that antibodies to ox-LDL, possibly resulting from B cell hyperactivity, might exert a protective role in the development of atherosclerosis among primary SS patients."
16917,1780,OBJECTIVES: To investigate the expression of IL-34 in labial salivary glands (LSGs) of patients with primary SS (p-SS) and its role in inducing a pro-inflammatory monocyte phenotype.
16918,1780,METHODS: LSG biopsies were obtained from 20 patients with p-SS and 10 patients with non-Sjgren's sicca syndrome (n-SS).
16919,1780,"The expression of IL-34, IL-1, TNF-, IL-17 and IL-23 was assessed by real-time PCR."
16920,1780,IL-34 expression was also investigated in LSGs by immunohistochemistry.
16921,1780,The frequencies of subpopulations of CD14(+) monocytes were evaluated by flow cytometry among isolated mononuclear cells from peripheral blood and salivary glands from both patients and controls.
16922,1780,The role of recombinant IL-34 on isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also evaluated.
16923,1780,"RESULTS: IL-34 m-RNA was overexpressed in the inflamed salivary glands of p-SS and associated with increased expression of TNF-, IL-1, IL-17 and IL-23p19."
16924,1780,The increased expression of IL-34 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded salivary glands from p-SS patients.
16925,1780,IL-34 expression was accompanied by the expansion of pro-inflammatory CD14(bright)CD16(+) monocytes in the salivary glands.
16926,1780,In vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with IL-34 induced the expansion of both CD14(+)CD16(-) cells and CD14(bright)CD16(+) cells in p-SS and non-SS subjects.
16927,1780,CONCLUSION: IL-34 seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of salivary gland inflammation in p-SS.
16928,1781,The most common systemic rheumatologic conditions are connective tissue diseases (including rheumatoid arthritis [RA]) followed by spondyloarthropathy.
16929,1781,"With the advent of biotherapies and imaging biomarkers, development in the imaging of RA and spondyloarthropathies has received substantial attention in the literature."
16930,1781,"This article details the various musculoskeletal imaging features of the other connective tissue diseases such as scleroderma and progressive systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Still's disease, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, Sjgren's syndrome, and mixed connective tissue disease."
16931,1782,"A 73-year-old woman with Sjgren's syndrome and autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) associated with large granular lymphocytosis of the polyclonal T cell type, demonstrated autoimmune thrombocytopenia (AIT) at diagnosis of sigmoid colon cancer."
16932,1782,"Ten months later, both AIN and AIT had exacerbated to agranulocytosis and severe thrombocytopenia below 1010(9)/L, respectively."
16933,1782,There were no dysplastic features of bone marrow hematopoietic cells.
16934,1782,"Furthermore, an in vitro assay of hematopoietic progenitors showed normal granuloid and erythroid colony formation."
16935,1782,"Although we serially treated her with prednisolone (oral), filgrastim, intravenous high-dose immunoglobulin infusion, cyclophosphamide (oral), danazol, cyclosporine A (oral), and rituximab, number of neutrophils and platelets elevated only temporarily."
16936,1782,"During the course of agranulocytosis and severe thrombocytopenia, the patient also developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)."
16937,1782,She died of pneumonia 5 months after the onset of agranulocytosis.
16938,1782,"This case is very unique and novel in terms of autoimmune phenomena simultaneously directed to granulocytes, platelets, and red blood cells under the background of Sjgren's syndrome."
16939,1783,BACKGROUND: Drug-induced subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus is an uncommon disorder associated with the use of pharmacological agents including systemic chemotherapy.
16940,1783,"CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of docetaxel-induced subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus in a 60-year-old Caucasian female with Sjgren's syndrome diagnosed 2 months after receiving docetaxel as part of the adjuvant FEC-D (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel) chemotherapy protocol for early stage breast cancer."
16941,1783,"Although the exact mechanisms behind the autoimmune response elicited by docetaxel are unclear, the involvement of anti-SSA/Ro antibodies has been implicated."
16942,1783,"CONCLUSION: This case highlights the symptom severity and clinical course of docetaxel-induced subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and highlights the importance of recognizing this uncommon but potentially severe chemotherapy-associated cutaneous reaction."
16943,1784,PURPOSE: To assess the etiologies and outcome of liver granulomatosis.
16944,1784,METHODS: We analyzed all consecutive liver granulomatosis diagnosed in our internal medicine department from 2000 to 2008.
16945,1784,"RESULTS: Among 471 liver biopsies, 21 disclosed evidence of liver granulomatosis (4.5%), in sixteen women (76%) and five men, with a median age of 41years."
16946,1784,Thirteen were caucasians (62%).
16947,1784,"At the time of diagnosis, six (28.5%) had isolated abnormal liver function tests, and fifteen (71.4%) presented with clinical manifestations."
16948,1784,The underlying cause was identified in 18 cases (85.7%).
16949,1784,"Eleven (52.3%) were systemic diseases: five (23.8%) primary biliary cirrhosis, two (9.5%) primary sclerosing cholangitis, two (9.5%) common variable immunodeficiency, one (4.7%) Sjgren's syndrome, and one (4.7%) Behet's disease."
16950,1784,Two (9.5%) patients had sarcoidosis.
16951,1784,"Three (14.3%) liver granulomatosis were of infectious origin (tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, and hepatitis C virus), two (9.5%) were neoplastic (Hodgkin's lymphoma and liver cell adenoma), and three (14.3%) were idiopathic."
16952,1784,"With a median of 38 months of follow-up, four patients (19%, two common variable immunodeficiency and two sarcoidosis) developed portal hypertension, independently of cirrhosis."
16953,1784,One patient died of cryptococcosis.
16954,1784,"CONCLUSION: In accordance with other European studies, systemic diseases are the main causes of hepatic granulomas."
16955,1784,Liver granulomatosis related to common variable immunodeficiency and sarcoidosis are at risk of portal hypertension.
16956,1785,Lymphoid infiltrates are relatively common in the ocular adnexa and the salivary glands.
16957,1785,They are of a variety of types and include both reactive processes and lymphomas.
16958,1785,"Within the ocular adnexa in years past, lymphoid proliferations were classified as inflammatory pseudotumor, reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, atypical lymphoid hyperplasia, and lymphoma."
16959,1785,"With improvements in diagnostic techniques and with advances in lymphoma subclassification, it became clear that many of the dense lymphoid infiltrates, including cases classified as lymphoma and likely some classified as atypical lymphoid hyperplasia, represented low-grade B-cell lymphomas, the most common of which by far were extranodal marginal zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas."
16960,1785,"Ocular adnexal inflammatory pseudotumor, reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, and chronic sclerosing sialadenitis were recognized, but the focus in diagnosis had been on avoiding misdiagnosis as a neoplastic process and in planning appropriate therapy."
16961,1785,"Recently, it has become clear that many cases of these reactive processes fall into the spectrum of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease, offering new insight into the pathogenesis of inflammatory lesions occurring in the ocular adnexa and the salivary glands."
16962,1785,"The majority of entities previously classified as chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, Mikulicz disease, orbital pseudolymphoma, and eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis are now considered a part of the IgG4-related disease spectrum."
16963,1785,"In this review, we discuss the histologic and immunohistochemical features of IgG4-related disease of the head and neck and provide guidance for distinguishing this disease from its many mimics."
16964,1786,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients could be distinguished based on the time of disease onset and, if so, whether the groups differed in their clinical and laboratory features in ethnically homogeneous Korean patients."
16965,1786,METHODS: We enrolled 201 SLE patients with available clinical data at the time of onset of SLE from the lupus cohort at Chonnam National University Hospital.
16966,1786,"Sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory data, including autoantibodies, and concomitant diseases were found at the time of diagnosis of SLE by reviewing patient charts."
16967,1786,"We divided SLE patients according to age at SLE diagnosis into three groups: juvenile-onset SLE (JSLE, diagnosed at18 years), adult-onset SLE (ASLE, diagnosed at 19-50 years), and late-onset SLE (LSLE, diagnosed at >50 years), and compared baseline demographic, clinical, and relevant laboratory findings."
16968,1786,"RESULTS: Of the 201 patients, 27 (14.4%), 149 (74.1%), and 25 (12.4%) were JSLE, ASLE, and LSLE patients, respectively."
16969,1786,"Fever, oral ulcers, nephritis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were more common in JSLE patients than ASLE or LSLE patients (p<0.05,<0.05, 0.001,<0.05, and<0.05, respectively)."
16970,1786,"However, Sjgren's syndrome was more frequent in LSLE patients than JSLE or ASLE patients (p<0.05)."
16971,1786,Disease activity was significantly higher in JSLE patients than in ASLE or LSLE patients (p<0.001).
16972,1786,"Anti-dsDNA and anti-nucleosome antibodies were found more frequently in JSLE patients and less frequently in LSLE patients (p<0.05 and 0.005, respectively) and decreased complement levels were more common in JSLE patients and less common in LSLE patients (p<0.001, 0.001, and<0.05, respectively)."
16973,1786,CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that SLE patients present with different clinical and serological manifestations according to age at disease onset.
16974,1786,"JSLE patients have more severe disease activity and more frequent renal involvement and LSLE patients have milder disease activity, more commonly accompanied by Sjgren's syndrome, at disease onset."
16975,1787,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease which can affect most organ systems including skin, joints and the kidney."
16976,1787,"Clinically, SLE is a heterogeneous disease and shares features of several other rheumatic diseases, in particular primary Sjgrens syndrome (pSS) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), why it is difficult to diagnose The pathogenesis of SLE is not completely understood, partly due to the heterogeneity of the disease."
16977,1787,This study demonstrates that metabolomics can be used as a tool for improved diagnosis of SLE compared to other similar autoimmune diseases.
16978,1787,"We observed differences in metabolic profiles with a classification specificity above 67% in the comparison of SLE with pSS, SSc and a matched group of healthy individuals."
16979,1787,Selected metabolites were also significantly different between studied diseases.
16980,1787,Biochemical pathway analysis was conducted to gain understanding of underlying pathways involved in the SLE pathogenesis.
16981,1787,"We found an increased oxidative activity in SLE, supported by increased xanthine oxidase activity and an increased turnover in the urea cycle."
16982,1787,"The most discriminatory metabolite observed was tryptophan, with decreased levels in SLE patients compared to control groups."
16983,1787,Changes of tryptophan levels were related to changes in the activity of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and/or to activation of the kynurenine pathway.
16984,1788,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by exocrinopathy that leads to dry eye and mouth.
16985,1788,"Although lymphocyte infiltration into exocrine glands and the generation of autoantibodies have been reported in SS, its pathogenic mechanism remains elusive."
16986,1788,"Here, we show that mice lacking the transcriptional regulator IB- developed SS-like inflammation characterized by lymphocyte-infiltrated dacryoadenitis and SS-associated autoantibodies."
16987,1788,"In particular, epithelial cells, but not hematopoietic cells, lacking IB- were essential for the development of inflammation."
16988,1788,IB--deficient epithelial cells in the lacrimal glands exhibited enhanced apoptosis even in the absence of lymphocytes.
16989,1788,"Administration of caspase inhibitors ameliorated the inflammation, indicating the critical role of caspase-mediated apoptosis."
16990,1788,"Furthermore, epithelial cell-specific STAT3-deficient mice developed SS-like inflammation with impaired IB- expression in the lacrimal glands."
16991,1788,"Thus, this study reveals a pathogenic mechanism of SS in which dysfunction of epithelial cells caused by disruption of STAT3-mediated IB- induction elicits the activation of self-reactive lymphocytes."
16992,1789,"BACKGROUND: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) has been associated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and asthma; however, no population-based cohort study has been performed."
16993,1789,We evaluated the risk of asthma in patients with primary SS in a nationwide population.
16994,1789,METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan.
16995,1789,The primary SS group included 4725 adult patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2006.
16996,1789,"Each patient was frequency-matched with four people without SS by sex, age and year of diagnosis."
16997,1789,The occurrence and hazard ratio (HR) of asthma was monitored by the end of 2011.
16998,1789,"RESULTS: The overall incidence density of asthma was 1.62-fold higher in the primary SS group than in the non-SS group (9.86 vs. 6.10 per 1000 person-years), with a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model measured adjusted HR of 1.38 [95% confidence interval (CI)=1.21-1.58]."
16999,1789,"Stratified analyses by sex, age group, and presence of comorbidity revealed that asthma incidences were all higher in the primary SS group than in the non-SS group, and the relative HRs of asthma associated with primary SS were significant in all subgroups."
17000,1789,CONCLUSION: Patients with primary SS are associated with an increased risk of developing asthma.
17001,1789,We should pay more attention to this group of individuals and provide them with appropriate support.
17002,1790,"Xerostomia (dry mouth) is the cardinal symptom of Sjgren's syndrome (SS), which is an autoimmune disease involving the exocrine glands and other organs."
17003,1790,Xerostomia may predispose patients to periodontal disease (PD) and an association between SS and PD has been reported.
17004,1790,"This association may be bidirectional; therefore, we conducted this study to investigate the risk of SS in patients with PD using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan."
17005,1790,"A total of 135,190 patients were enrolled in our analysis."
17006,1790,"In all, 27,041 patients with PD were matched by gender, age, insured region, urbanization and income, with cases and controls in a 1:4 ratio."
17007,1790,Both groups were followed and the risks of SS were calculated by Cox proportional hazards regression.
17008,1790,"Finally, 3292 (2.4%) patients had newly diagnosed SS."
17009,1790,"Patients with PD had a significantly higher risk of subsequent SS (903 (3.3%) vs. 2389 (2.2%), adjusted hazard 1.47, 95% confidence interval: 1.361.59)."
17010,1790,"In conclusion, patients with PD had an approximately 50% increased risk of subsequent SS."
17011,1790,Physicians should be aware of the symptoms and signs of SS in patients with PD.
17012,1791,"BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW: The authors report the case of a patient with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and Sjgren syndrome, showing signs and symptoms of bilateral trigeminal neuropathy and aseptic meningitis."
17013,1791,"The patient was assessed by means of quantitative sensory testing (QST) according to the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain standards, in both the gingiva and forearm, and the results were compared with those of healthy control participants."
17014,1791,"CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27-year-old woman, who had received a diagnosis of MCTD and Sjgren syndrome from a rheumatologist, sought treatment at an orofacial pain clinic for bilateral electriclike pain in the maxillary anterior gingiva, eyelids, and cheeks."
17015,1791,"QST indicated allodynia and hyperalgesia in response to mechanical and thermal stimuli in both her gingiva and forearm, and cold hyperalgesia in her forearm only."
17016,1791,"She had been prescribed an oral corticosteroid (prednisone, 7 milligrams per day) by the rheumatologist, and was given lidocaine gel and systemic pregabalin (400 mg/d) at the clinic."
17017,1791,CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The cause of trigeminal neuropathy in MCTD and Sjgren syndrome (SS) is unknown.
17018,1791,"The QST data in this case showed that the somatosensory disturbance severity was higher in the gingiva than in the forearm, suggesting that the trigeminal nerve may be more susceptible than other parts of the nervous system in patients with MCTD."
17019,1791,"If reproducible in future studies, the finding of greater hypersensitivity in the gingiva than in the forearm may provide an opportunity for dentists to play a role in the detection, diagnosis, or both of MCTD and SS."
17020,1791,Dentists must be sufficiently familiar with MCTD and SS to include them in their differential diagnoses and should consider performing simple neurosensory testing such as via intraoral cotton swab or pinprick test.
17021,1792,OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of extraglandular manifestations in primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) among participants enrolled in the Sjgren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) Registry.
17022,1792,"METHODS: A total of 1,927 participants in the SICCA registry were studied, including 886 participants who met the 2002 American-European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria for primary SS, 830 ""intermediate"" cases who had some objective findings of primary SS but did not meet AECG criteria, and 211 control individuals."
17023,1792,"We studied the prevalence of immunologic and hematologic laboratory abnormalities, specific rheumatologic examination findings, and physician-confirmed thyroid, liver, and kidney disease, as well as lymphoma among SICCA participants."
17024,1792,"RESULTS: Laboratory abnormalities, including hematologic abnormalities, hypergammaglobulinemia, and hypocomplementemia, frequently occurred among primary SS cases and were more common among the intermediate cases than among control participants."
17025,1792,Cutaneous vasculitis and lymphadenopathy were also more common among primary SS cases.
17026,1792,"In contrast, the frequency of physician-confirmed diagnoses of thyroid, liver, and kidney disease and lymphoma was low and only primary biliary cirrhosis was associated with primary SS case status."
17027,1792,"Rheumatologic and neurologic symptoms were common among all SICCA participants, regardless of case status."
17028,1792,"CONCLUSION: Data from the international SICCA registry support the systemic nature of primary SS, manifested primarily in terms of specific immunologic and hematologic abnormalities."
17029,1792,The occurrence of other systemic disorders among this cohort is relatively uncommon.
17030,1792,"Previously reported associations may be more specific to select patient subgroups, such as those referred for evaluation of certain neurologic, rheumatologic, or other systemic manifestations."
17031,1793,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) involves a chronic, progressive inflammation primarily of the salivary and lacrimal glands leading to decreased levels of saliva and tears that eventually result in dry mouth and dry eye diseases."
17032,1793,"T(H)17 cell populations secreting IL17A have been shown to have an important function in an increasing number of autoimmune diseases, including SS."
17033,1793,"In this study, we investigated the function of IL17A on SS development and onset."
17034,1793,Adenovirus-5 vectors expressing either IL17R:fragment of crystallization (Fc) fusion protein or LacZ were injected through retrograde cannulation into the salivary glands of SS-susceptible (SS(S)) C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice between 6 and 8 weeks of age (a pre-disease stage) or 15 and 17 weeks of age (a diseased stage).
17035,1793,The mice were subsequently characterized for their SS phenotypes.
17036,1793,"Mice cannulated with the Ad5-IL17R:Fc viral vector at either 7 or 16 weeks of age exhibited a rapid temporal, yet persistent, decrease in the levels of serum IL17 as well as the overall numbers of CD4+IL17+T cells present in their spleens."
17037,1793,"Disease profiling indicated that these mice showed decreased lymphocytic infiltrations of their salivary glands, normalization of their antinuclear antibodies repertoire, and increased saliva secretion."
17038,1793,"In contrast, mice cannulated with the control Ad5-LacZ viral vector did not exhibit similar changes and progressed to the overt disease stage."
17039,1793,The capacity of the Ad5-IL17R:Fc-blocking factor to reduce SS pathology in SS(S) mice strongly suggests that IL17 is an important inflammatory cytokine in salivary gland dysfunction.
17040,1793,"Thus, therapeutic approach targeting IL17 may be effective in preventing glandular dysfunction."
17041,1794,Aberrant removal of necrotic debris is considered a feature with inflammatory consequences in SLE.
17042,1794,"Herein, primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) patients were investigated for the first time for the capacity of their sera to degrade secondary necrotic cell remnants (SNEC) and DNA (endonuclease DNase1 activity), as well as for uptake of SNEC by blood-borne phagocytes."
17043,1794,"For comparison, specimens from unselected SLE and RA patients and from healthy blood donors (HBD) were also studied."
17044,1794,"Compared to HBD, the sera from SS and SLE patients studied (but not RA) were found to exhibit significantly impaired capacity for degradation of SNEC (both for p=0.007) and deficient DNase1 activity (both for p<0.0001)."
17045,1794,The deficient DNase1 activity in SS and SLE sera did not owe to decreased DNase1 protein levels.
17046,1794,"It correlated inversely with increased serum levels of circulating nucleosomes and cell-free DNA (p<0.0001), as well as with the disease activity indices of SS (r=-0.445, p=0.0001) and SLE (r=-0.500, p=0.013)."
17047,1794,"In ex-vivo whole blood analyses, SS and SLE patients (but not RA) also manifested significantly increased SNEC-phagocytosis by monocytes and granulocytes (all for p<0.0001) that also correlated with disease severity indices of SS (p=0.001) and SLE (p=0.01)."
17048,1794,"In various cross-admixture experiments, such aberration was found to reside in the hyperfunctional activity of phagocytes, the impaired degrading activity of serum DNase1 and the SNEC-binding capacity of serum IgG of SS and SLE patients."
17049,1794,"The sera of SS and SLE patients (but not of RA) induced significant SNEC-phagocytosis by healthy monocytes that correlated inversely with the DNase1 activity (r=-0.634, p<0.0001) of these sera."
17050,1794,"In line with this, the inhibition of DNase1 in HBD sera by G-actin was found to lead to significantly diminished SNEC degradation and increased SNEC uptake by healthy phagocytes (p=0.0009), supporting the important physiologic role of serum DNase1 in the prevention of SNEC-phagocytosis."
17051,1794,"Purified serum IgG preparations from SS and SLE patients manifested increased binding to SNEC and were able to enhance significantly the engulfment of SNEC by healthy phagocytes both directly (under serum-free conditions, p0.009) and via the prevention of physiologic degradation of SNEC by serum, most likely due to their ""shielding"" against endonuclease digestion (p=0.0005)."
17052,1794,"These data indicate that upon cell necrosis, the immune system of SS and SLE patients may be overly exposed to the necrotic debris, a fact that probably holds a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune reactions observed in these disorders."
17053,1795,Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) of the lung is a rare condition.
17054,1795,Radiological properties and clinical presentation of this disease can mimic malignant process.
17055,1795,We present a case of IMT of the lung in a 58 year old female patient with a single lung nodule.
17056,1795,"Tumor was unencapsulated, firm, and well circumscribed."
17057,1795,Microscopically tumor had multinodular structure with single or multiple small blood vessels in the center of each nodule surrounded in circular pattern by connective tissue containing spindle cells embedded into the thick layers of extracellular matrix.
17058,1795,Extracellular matrix was identified as type I and type III collagen fibrils embedded into type IV collagen and laminin.
17059,1795,"The tumor was surrounded by T-, B-lymphocytes and polyclonal plasma cells."
17060,1795,"Histological organization of this lesion's stromal component was unique, but cell composition was similar to inflammatory pseudotumor of the lung."
17061,1795,"In addition, tumor tissue sections exhibited strong positivity for IgG, weak positivity for IgA, 1Cq, but were negative for IgM, and C3."
17062,1795,"Mutational analysis of the EGFR, KRAS genes and ALK locus rearrangement were performed and did not reveal any mutations."
17063,1795,"This is the first report of an IMT associated with Sjgren's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma developing in the lungs."
17064,1795,Patient was clinically followed up for 18 months and no recurrence of the tumor observed.
17065,1796,"PURPOSE: To evaluate sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of colour difference plot analysis (CDPA) of 103 hexagon multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) in detecting established hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinal toxicity."
17066,1796,METHODS: Twenty-three patients taking HCQ were divided into those with and without retinal toxicity and were compared with a control group without retinal disease and not taking HCQ.
17067,1796,CDPA with two masked examiners was performed using age-corrected mfERG responses in the central ring (Rc ; 0-5.5 degrees from fixation) and paracentral ring (Rp ; 5.5-11 degrees from fixation).
17068,1796,An abnormal ring was defined as containing any hexagons with a difference in two or more standard deviations from normal (colour blue or black).
17069,1796,RESULTS: Categorical analysis (ring involvement or not) showed Rc had 83% sensitivity and 93% specificity.
17070,1796,Rp had 89% sensitivity and 82% specificity.
17071,1796,"Requiring abnormal hexagons in both Rc and Rp yielded sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 95%, respectively."
17072,1796,"If required in only one ring, they were 89% and 80%, respectively."
17073,1796,"In this population, there was complete agreement in identifying toxicity when comparing CDPA using Rp with ring ratio analysis using R5/R4 P1 ring responses (89% sensitivity and 95% specificity)."
17074,1796,Continuous analysis of CDPA with receiver operating characteristic analysis showed optimized detection (83% sensitivity and 96% specificity) when 4 abnormal hexagons were present anywhere within the Rp ring outline.
17075,1796,Intergrader agreement and reproducibility were good.
17076,1796,CONCLUSIONS: Colour difference plot analysis had sensitivity and specificity that approached that of ring ratio analysis of R5/R4 P responses.
17077,1796,Ease of implementation and reproducibility are notable advantages of CDPA.
17078,1797,BACKGROUND: Our previous proteomic study indicated that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) may be a potential biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosis.
17079,1797,The aim was to assess the performance of CTGF as a biomarker of RA.
17080,1797,METHOD: Serum and synovial fluid CTGF was detected using a direct high sensitivity sandwich ELISA kit.
17081,1797,Serum CTGF levels were tested for discriminatory capacity and optimal assay cutoffs determined in a training cohort of 98 cases of RA with 103 healthy controls.
17082,1797,"The assay performance was then validated in a further cohort of 572 patients (with RA (n=217), ankylosing spondylitis (n=92), gout (n=74), osteoarthritis (n=52), systemic lupus erythematosus (n=72), or primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) (n=65))."
17083,1797,"RESULTS: Significant elevation of synovial fluid CTGF concentration was found in RA patients, demonstrating excellent diagnostic ability to predict RA (area under the curve (AUC)=0.97)."
17084,1797,Similar results were found in serum CTGF detection.
17085,1797,"At the optimal cutoff value 88.66pg/mL, the sensitivity, specificity, and the AUC was 0.86, 0.92, and 0.92, respectively, in the training cohort."
17086,1797,"Similar performance was observed in the validation cohort, with sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood, and negative likelihood of 0.82, 0.91, 5.74, and 0.12, respectively."
17087,1797,"Stronger discriminatory capacity was seen with the combination of CTGF and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) (AUC=0.96) than with either ACPA or rheumatoid factor (RF) alone (AUC=0.80 or 0.79, respectively)."
17088,1797,"The discriminatory performance of serum CTGF was consistent across all inflammatory conditions tested (AUC >0.92 in all cases), with the sole exception of pSS."
17089,1797,Serum CTGF did not vary with symptom duration or disease activity.
17090,1797,"CONCLUSIONS: Serum CTGF is a promising diagnostic biomarker for RA, with performance in the current study better than either ACPA or RF."
17091,1798,OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the balance of blood follicular helper T (Tfh) cells and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells can provide information about ectopic lymphoid neogenesis and disease activity in primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
17092,1798,METHODS: We prospectively recruited 56 patients clinically suspected of having SS.
17093,1798,Sixteen of these patients subsequently fulfilled the American-European Consensus Group criteria for SS and were compared to 16 patients with non-SS sicca syndrome.
17094,1798,Paired blood and minor salivary gland (MSG) biopsy samples were analyzed to study Tfr cells and subsets of Tfh cells in both compartments.
17095,1798,"RESULTS: Patients with primary SS had normal Tfh cell counts in peripheral blood; however, activatedprogrammed death 1-positive (PD-1+) inducible costimulator-positive (ICOS+)Tfh cells in peripheral blood were strongly associated with disease activity assessed by the European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (r = 0.8547, P = 0.0008)."
17096,1798,"Conversely, the blood Tfr cell:Tfh cell ratio indicated ectopic lymphoid structure formation in MSGs, being strongly associated with B cell, CD4+ T cell, and PD-1+ICOS+T cellinfiltration in MSGs, and was especially increased in patients with focal sialadenitis."
17097,1798,"Further analysis showed that the blood Tfr cell:Tfh cell ratio allowed discriminationbetween SS patients and healthy donors with excellentaccuracy and was a strong predictor of SS diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 12.96, P = 0.028) and the presence of focalsialadenitis (OR 10, P = 0.022) in patients investigatedfor sicca symptoms, thus highlighting the potential clinical value of this marker."
17098,1798,CONCLUSION: The blood Tfr cell:Tfh cell ratio and PD-1+ICOS+Tfh cells constitute potential novel biomarkers for different features of primary SS.
17099,1798,"While the blood Tfr cell:Tfh cell ratio is associated with ectopic lymphoid neogenesis, activated Tfh cells indicate disease activity."
17100,1799,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the level of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7, 8, and 9 in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PMBCs) from patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and whether TLR7 and 9 exist in the parotid glands of pSS patients."
17101,1799,"METHODS: TLR7, 8, and 9 mRNA levels in PMBC from 37 pSS patients and 24 controls were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction."
17102,1799,"TLR7- and TLR9-positive cells in parotid glands from 20 pSS patients and 10 controls were observed using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, respectively."
17103,1799,Statistical analysis was performed by Student t test.
17104,1799,"RESULTS: TLR7 and TLR9 mRNA levels were 2.17- and 2.33-fold higher in pSS patients than control subjects, respectively (P < .05), whereas TLR8 levels were not."
17105,1799,"TLR7- and TLR9-positive cells of the pSS group were localized in the epithelial islands, lymphocytes, and ductal epithelial cells of the parotid glands and were more abundant than the TLR7- and TLR9-positive cells that were only localized to the ductal epithelial cells of parotid glands (P < .05)."
17106,1799,"CONCLUSION: TLR7 and TLR9 mRNA levels are up-regulated in the PMBC of pSS patients, and TLR7- and TLR9-positive cells exist in the epithelial islands, lymphocytes, and ductal epithelial cells of the parotid glands of individuals affected by pSS, but are limited to the ductal epithelial cells of controls."
17107,1800,"Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate in vitro at temperatures less than 37C and produce organ damage through two main pathways: vascular sludging (hyperviscosity syndrome, mainly in type I cryoglobulinaemia) and immune-mediated mechanisms (principally vasculitis, in mixed cryoglobulinaemia)."
17108,1800,"Cryoglobulinaemia is associated with many illnesses, which can be broadly grouped into infections, autoimmune disorders, and malignancies; the most common cause is infection with hepatitis C virus."
17109,1800,"Mixed cryoglobulinaemic syndrome is diagnosed when a patient has typical organ involvement (mainly skin, kidney, or peripheral nerve) and circulating cryoglobulins."
17110,1800,Cutaneous purpura is the most common manifestation of cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis.
17111,1800,"The most frequently affected internal organs are the peripheral nerves, kidneys, and joints."
17112,1800,The course varies widely and prognosis is influenced by both cryoglobulinaemic damage to vital organs and by comorbidities associated with underlying diseases.
17113,1800,More than 90% of cases of cryoglobulinaemia have a known underlying cause; therefore treatment is focused on the cause of the disorder rather than merely symptomatic relief.
17114,1800,Studies suggest that both combined or sequential antiviral therapies and targeted biological treatments might be more effective than monotherapy.
17115,1801,OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and radiological characteristics and outcomes of patients with aquaporin-4-immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG) seropositive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) coexisting with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) in a single center.
17116,1801,METHODS: We included patients with diagnosis of NMOSD and a concomitant diagnosis of SLE or pSS.
17117,1801,"Demographic, clinical, serological and imaging characteristics were retrieved from clinical charts."
17118,1801,"RESULTS: Twelve patients were included, of whom 11 (91.7%) were women."
17119,1801,Seven (58.3%) had SLE and five (41.7%) pSS.
17120,1801,"In five (41.7%) patients NMOSD followed SLE/pSS onset, four (33.3%) patients had a simultaneous presentation, and in three (25%) NMOSD preceded pSS onset."
17121,1801,The mean age at first neurological event was 39 years.
17122,1801,"Eleven patients (91.7%) experienced acute transverse myelitis/longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, five (41.7%) optic neuritis, three (25%) a cerebral syndrome and two (16.7%) each area postrema syndrome, acute brainstem syndrome and cerebellar syndrome."
17123,1801,Eleven (91.7%) patients went into either total or partial NMOSD remission at median follow-up of 89.5 months.
17124,1801,CONCLUSION: AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD arose in the context of quiescent SLE and pSS with extraglandular features.
17125,1801,"As NMOSD coexisting with SLE/pSS is rare, collaborative multicenter studies are needed to clarify the natural history and outcomes of this overlap syndrome."
17126,1802,OBJECTIVES: The reversibility of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in SSc is difficult to assess by current diagnostic modalities and there is clinical need for imaging techniques that allow for treatment stratification and monitoring.
17127,1802,18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT scanning may be of interest for this purpose by detection of metabolic activity in lung tissue.
17128,1802,This study aimed to investigate the potential role of 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning for the quantitative assessment of SSc-related active ILD.
17129,1802,"METHODS: 18F-FDG PET/CT scans and high resolution CT scans of eight SSc patients, including five with ILD, were analysed."
17130,1802,"For comparison, reference groups were included: eight SLE patients and four primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients, all without ILD."
17131,1802,"A total of 22 regions of interest were drawn in each patient at apical, medial and dorsobasal lung levels."
17132,1802,18F-FDG uptake was measured as mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) in each region of interest.
17133,1802,"Subsequently, basal/apical (B/A) and medial/apical (M/A) ratios were calculated at patient level (B/A-p and M/A-p) and at tissue level (B/A-t and M/A-t)."
17134,1802,"RESULTS: SUVmean values in dorsobasal ROIs and B/A-p ratios were increased in SSc with ILD compared with SSc without ILD (P = 0.04 and P = 0.07, respectively), SLE (P = 0.003 and P = 0.002, respectively) and pSS (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02, respectively)."
17135,1802,Increased uptake in the dorsobasal lungs and increased B/A-t ratios corresponded to both ground glass and reticulation on high resolution CT.
17136,1802,"CONCLUSION: Semi-quantitative assessment of 18F-FDG PET/CT is able to distinguish ILD from non-affected lung tissue in SSc, suggesting that it may be used as a new biomarker for SSc-ILD disease activity."
17137,1803,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS) are prone to develop malignant lymphomas, and a correlation has been established between the lymphoproliferations occurring in these disorders and the presence in patients' blood of an unusual B cell population that down-regulates complement receptor 2/CD21."
17138,1803,This study was undertaken to identify the B cell compartment from which these lymphoproliferations emerge and determine the mechanisms that promote clonal B cell expansion in patients with SS.
17139,1803,"METHODS: The reactivity of antibodies expressed by CD19+CD10-CD27-IgM+CD21(-/low) cells isolated from the blood of patients with SS was tested using apolymerase chain reaction-based approach that allows us to clone and express, in vitro, recombinant antibodies produced by single B cells."
17140,1803,RESULTS: Clonal expansions were identified in CD21(-/low) B cells isolated from the peripheral blood of 3 patients with SS.
17141,1803,These lymphoproliferations expressed B cell receptors (BCRs) that displayed somatic hypermutation lineage trees characteristic of a strong selection by antigens; one of these antigens was identified as a ribosomal self antigen.
17142,1803,"When the mutated BCR sequences expressed by the expanded CD21(-/low) B cell clones from patients with SS were reverted invitro to their germline counterparts, one clone remained autoreactive."
17143,1803,"CONCLUSION: Clonal lymphoproliferations in patients with SS preferentially accumulate in the autoreactive CD21(-/low) B cell compartment often expanded in these subjects, and recognition of self antigens may drive the clonal B cell expansion while further refining BCR self-reactivity."
17144,1804,"Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are complex diseases characterized by persistent or recurrent inflammation, alteration of immune response, and production of specific autoantibodies."
17145,1804,It is known that different AIDs share several susceptibility genetic loci.
17146,1804,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha inducible protein 3 (TNFAIP3) encodes the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20, which downregulates inflammation by restricting NF-B, a transcription factor that regulates expression of various proinflammatory genes."
17147,1804,Variants in TNFAIP3 gene have been described as associated with susceptibility to several AIDs.
17148,1804,"Here, we analyzed two TNFAIP3 polymorphisms in Italian patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS), to verify if the genetic variability of TNFAIP3 gene is involved in genetic predisposition to AIDs also in the Italian population."
17149,1804,"We recruited 313 SLE patients, 256 RA patients, 195 pSS patients, and 236 healthy controls."
17150,1804,Genotyping of rs2230926 and rs6920220 in TNFAIP3 gene was performed by an allelic discrimination assay.
17151,1804,We carried out a case/control association study and a genotype/phenotype correlation analysis.
17152,1804,"A higher risk to develop SLE was observed for rs2230926 (P = 0.02, OR = 1.92)."
17153,1804,No association was observed between this SNP and the susceptibility to pSS or RA.
17154,1804,"However, the rs2230926 variant allele seems to confer a higher risk to develop lymphoma in pSS patients, while in RA patients, the presence of RF resulted significantly associated with the variant allele."
17155,1804,"Regarding the rs6920220 SNP, we observed a significant association of the variant allele with SLE (P = 0.03, OR = 1.53), pSS (P = 0.016, OR = 1.69), and RA (P = 0.0001, OR = 2.35) susceptibility."
17156,1804,"Furthermore, SLE patients carrying the variant allele showed a higher risk to develop pericarditis, pleurisy, and kidney complications."
17157,1804,Our results support the importance of the TNFAIP3 gene variant role in the development of different autoimmune diseases in the Italian population and furtherly confirm a sharing of genetic predisposing factors among these three pathologies.
17158,1805,"INTRODUCTION: Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is a generalized, non-follicular sterile pustular rash, categorized as a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, which usually has a favorable prognosis."
17159,1805,"In a majority of cases (90%), AGEP is drug induced and different drugs are reported as cause of AGEP."
17160,1805,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an antimalarial drug that is also used in some dermatologic and rheumatic diseases due to its immunosuppressive actions.
17161,1805,Some cases of AGEP induced by HCQ are reported in literature but only in adults.
17162,1805,"MATERIALS, METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe the first case of AGEP caused by HCQ in a child affected by juvenile Sjgren syndrome."
17163,1805,"After withdrawal of HCQ and subsequent administration, the patient experienced the same cutaneous reaction."
17164,1805,An allergy work-up was performed and patch test showed an ectopic flare of AGEP eruption.
17165,1805,"CONCLUSION: Our patient represents the first pediatric case of AGEP to HCQ, posing such a drug as a possible trigger also in children."
17166,1805,"Therefore, an accurate drug medical history is mandatory in order to rule out potential drug reactions when facing a sudden rash."
17167,1806,PURPOSE: To evaluate the response of the lacrimal function unit in Sjgren syndrome (SS)-associated dry eye patients exposed to 2 simulated daily life environmental conditions.
17168,1806,DESIGN: Prospective crossover pilot study.
17169,1806,"METHODS: Fourteen female SS dry eye patients were exposed for 2 hours to a controlled normal condition (23 C, 45% relative humidity, and air flow 0.10 m/s) and a controlled adverse condition that simulates desiccating stress (23 C, 5% relative humidity, and air flow 0.10 m/s)."
17170,1806,"The following dry eye tests were performed before and after the exposure: tear osmolarity, phenol red thread test, conjunctival hyperemia, fluorescein tear break-up time, corneal fluorescein staining, conjunctival lissamine green staining, and Schirmer test."
17171,1806,Levels of 16 molecules were analyzed in tears by multiplex immunobead analysis.
17172,1806,"RESULTS: Clinical evaluation showed lacrimal functional unit impairment after the desiccating stress: significantly increased tear osmolarity (315.7  3.0 vs 327.7  5.1 mOsm/L, P = .03), conjunctival hyperemia (1.3  0.1 vs 1.6  0.1, P = .05), and corneal staining in temporal (3.5  0.5 vs 4.7  0.4, P = .01) and nasal (3.6  0.5 vs 4.5  0.5, P = .04) areas."
17173,1806,"Tear concentrations increased for interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (16 557.1  4047.8 vs 31 895.3  5916.5 pg/mL, P = .01), interleukin-6 (63.8  20.2 vs 111.5  29.6 pg/mL, P = .02), interleukin-8 (2196.1  737.9 vs 3753.2  1106.0 pg/mL, P = .03), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (101 515.6  37 088.4 vs 145 867.1  41 651.5 pg/mL, P = .03)."
17174,1806,"After the simulated normal condition, only a significant increase in nasal corneal staining (2.9  0.5 vs 3.6  0.5, P = .03) was observed."
17175,1806,CONCLUSIONS: Even a short exposure to a desiccating environment can produce a significant deterioration of the lacrimal function unit in female SS dry eye patients.
17176,1806,"The often unnoticed exposure to these conditions during daily life may increase inflammatory activity rapidly, triggering an ocular surface deterioration."
17177,1807,"Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) is an autoimmune condition that primarily affects salivary and lacrimal glands, causing loss of secretion."
17178,1807,"We have previously shown that microRNA-146a (miR-146a) is over-expressed in the salivary glands and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of SjS-prone mice (C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2, B6DC) and in PBMC of SjS patients."
17179,1807,The purpose of this research was to identify a target molecule of miR-146a and identify subpopulations of cells affected by altered miR-146a in the salivary glands of SjS-prone mice.
17180,1807,In silico analyses identified costimulatory molecule CD80 as a potential target of miR-146a.
17181,1807,Luciferase assay of the human CD80 3'untranslated region demonstrated miR-146a directly inhibited CD80 protein expression as indicated by reduced luciferase reporter expression and an examination of B6DC salivary glands revealed a reduction in CD80 protein.
17182,1807,"More interestingly, the specific reduction in CD80 protein was detected from the salivary gland epithelial cell population and in interstitial dendritic cells in the glands as well."
17183,1807,The reduction in CD80 protein levels in salivary gland epithelial cells were negatively associated with elevated miR-146a expression.
17184,1807,"Therefore, this study provides the first indication that salivary gland epithelial cells may be critically involved in SjS progression by altering CD86:CD80 protein ratio in response to miR-146a upregulation."
17185,1808,Objective: To explore the predictive factors for determining the therapeutic response and prognosis of severe thrombocytopenia (TP) in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome(pSS).
17186,1808,Method: Patients with pSS and severe TP (platelet count  5010(9)/L) admitted between 2010 to 2016 at Peking Union Medical College Hospital were classified according to their therapeutic response and analyzed retrospectively.
17187,1808,The response parameters and clinical data including bone marrow aspiration results and laboratory findings were collected.
17188,1808,"Result: Thirty patients were finally analyzed, including twenty with appreciable bone marrow aspiration results."
17189,1808,"Fourteen and 7 patients achieved a complete response (CR) and a partial response (PR) respectively, other 9 patients with no response (NR)."
17190,1808,"The megakaryocyte counts in bone marrow (BM-MK) counts per slide in each group were 13.0 (9.2,23.5) in CR patients, 7.0 (7.0,20.0) in PR patients, and 5.0 (1.0,6.0) in NR patients."
17191,1808,BM-MK counts in patients with clinical response (CR+PR) were significantly higher than those with NR (P=0.006).
17192,1808,"A receiver-operation characteristic analysis revealed a cutoff value of BM-MK counts at 6.5 per slide stratifying patients by different responses with a sensitivity of 13/14, a specificity of 6/7, and area under the curve of 0.879."
17193,1808,Univariate analysis indicated a better prognosis as BM-MK counts>6.5 per slide.
17194,1808,Conclusion: BM-MK count could be a predictive factor of response in patients with pSS and severe TP.
17195,1808,Patients with BM-MK counts6.5 per slide represent worse platelet improvement..
17196,1809,"PURPOSE: Chronic inflammation of the lacrimal gland results in changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is believed to compromise tissue repair."
17197,1809,"We hypothesized that increased production/activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-2 and -9, in inflamed lacrimal glands modifies the ECM environment, therefore disrupting tissue repair."
17198,1809,"METHODS: The lacrimal glands from female MRL/lpr and male NOD mice along with their respective control strains were harvested and divided into three pieces and processed for histology, immunohistochemistry, zymography, Western blotting, and RNA analyses."
17199,1809,"In another study, MRL/lpr mice were treated for 5 weeks with a selective MMP2/9 inhibitor peptide or a control peptide."
17200,1809,"At the end of treatment, the lacrimal glands were excised and the tissue was processed as described above."
17201,1809,"RESULTS: There was a 2.5- and 2.7-fold increase in MMP2 gene expression levels in MRL/lpr and NOD mice, respectively."
17202,1809,Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 enzymatic activities and protein expression levels were significantly upregulated in the lacrimal glands of MRL/lpr and NOD mice compared to controls.
17203,1809,Treatment with the MMP2/9 inhibitor resulted in decreased activity of MMP-2 and -9 both in vitro and in vivo.
17204,1809,"Importantly, MMP2/9 inhibitor treatment of MRL/lpr mice improved aqueous tear production and resulted in reduced number and size of lymphocytic foci in diseased lacrimal glands."
17205,1809,"CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that MMP2/9 expression and activity are elevated in lacrimal glands of two murine models of Sjgren's syndrome, suggesting that manipulation of MMP2/9 activity might be a potential therapeutic target in chronically inflamed lacrimal glands."
17206,1810,OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a simple screening technique for diagnosis of hyposalivation with dry mouth by estimation of capsaicin-stimulated salivary flow using filter paper.
17207,1810,STUDY DESIGN: An assay system comprising 5 spots containing starch and potassium iodide on filter paper incorporating or without capsaicin and a coloring reagent was designed.
17208,1810,We investigated whether the number of colored spots using the filter paper incorporating capsaicin could distinguish between healthy subjects and subjects with hyposalivation and dry mouth.
17209,1810,"RESULTS: In the healthy group (>200 L/min; n = 33), the capsaicin-stimulated salivary flow significantly increased as compared with the resting salivary flow, from 1.2  1.4 to 2.9  1.3 colored spots (P < .05)."
17210,1810,"In contrast, the hyposalivation group with dry mouth (<100 L/min; n = 32) hardly changed (4.4  1.0 vs 4.9  0.2), except for 3 subjects who had considerable elevated secretion on capsaicin stimulation."
17211,1810,"CONCLUSION: By measuring resting and stimulated salivary flows, this method should be useful for evaluating retained functional ability of salivary glands and screening of hyposalivation with dry mouth."
17212,1811,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease that results in pathological dryness of mouth and eye.
17213,1811,The diagnosis of SS depends on both clinical evaluation and specific antibodies.
17214,1811,"The goal of this study was to use quantitative proteomics to investigate changes in tear proteins in a rabbit model of SS-associated dry eye, induced autoimmune dacryoadenitis (IAD)."
17215,1811,"Proteomic analysis was performed by iTRAQ and nano LC-MS/MS on tears collected from the ocular surface, and specific proteins were verified by high resolution MRM."
17216,1811,"It was found that in the tears of IAD rabbits at 2 and 4 weeks after induction, S100 A6, S100 A9, and serum albumin were upregulated, whereas serotransferrin (TF), prolactin-inducible protein (PIP), polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), and Ig gamma chain C region were downregulated."
17217,1811,"High resolution MRM with mTRAQ labeling verified the changes in S100 A6, TF, PIP, and pIgR."
17218,1811,"Our results indicated significant changes of tear proteins in IAD rabbits, suggesting these proteins could potentially be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of dry eye."
17219,1811,"Several of these proteins were also found in the tears of non-SS dry eye patients indicating a common basis of ocular surface pathology, however, pIgR appears to be unique to SS."
17220,1812,The paper describes a case of primary hepatic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in a 52-year-old woman with a 27-year history of Sjgren's disease.
17221,1812,"It gives the data available in the literature on the etiology, diagnosis, and morphological characteristics of primary hepatic lymphoma and touches upon the issues of differential diagnosis."
17222,1813,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of rituximab (RTX) in modulating the expression of the IL-17/IL-23 pathway in the salivary glands (SGs) of patients with primary SS (pSS).
17223,1813,METHODS: Consecutive SG biopsies were obtained from 15 patients with pSS before and after 1 year of RTX therapy.
17224,1813,"The SG expression of IL-17, IL-23p19 and p-STAT3 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry at baseline and after RTX therapy."
17225,1813,The role of mast cells in pSS patients in modulating the Th17 response and the immunologic effect of RTX on mast cells were also studied in in vitro experiments.
17226,1813,RESULTS: IL-17 was overexpressed in the SGs of patients with pSS mainly by infiltrating T cells and mast cells.
17227,1813,"After RTX therapy, the SG expression of IL-17, but not of IL-23p19 and p-STAT3, was significantly reduced and was accompanied by the depletion of tissue mast cells."
17228,1813,In in vitro experiments with heterologous peripheral lymphocytes RTX significantly induced the apoptosis of isolated mast cells.
17229,1813,"Finally, mast cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of pSS patients in vitro significantly increased Th17 lymphocytes."
17230,1813,CONCLUSION: RTX acts on pSS patients by globally reducing the expression of IL-17 and specifically inducing a pronounced apoptotic depletion of mast cells.
17231,1814,"We report the case of a 64-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and Sjgren's syndrome, treated during 48 months with hydroxychloroquine that was removed after an ophthalmological evaluation showed bilateral vision loss associated with paracentral scotoma in the visual field, fundoscopic macular pigmentary changes, and severely impaired central multifocal electrorretinogram (mfERG)."
17232,1814,"Twelve months after treatment withdrawal, visual acuity and central mfERG had surprisingly improved."
17233,1814,This is an unusual case of functional recovery after treatment withdrawal.
17234,1814,We consider that central mfERG is a more sensitive test than pattern electrorretinogram in the detection of retinal toxicity and functional vision recovery after hydroxychloroquine treatment cessation.
17235,1815,OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid factors (RFs) are associated with systemic disease in primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and may be pathogenic as mixed cryoglobulins.
17236,1815,Current detection methods cannot resolve RFs at a molecular level.
17237,1815,This study was undertaken to perform the first proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of secreted and membrane-bound IgM-RF in primary SS and identify unique heavy-chain peptide signatures for RF clonotype tracking.
17238,1815,METHODS: Purified heavy chains of serum RFs from 15 patients with primary SS were subjected to de novo mass spectrometric sequencing.
17239,1815,The circulating B cell Ig repertoire was determined by massively parallel sequencing of IGH RNA from matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n = 7).
17240,1815,RF-specific heavy-chain third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) peptides were identified by searching RF heavy-chain peptide sequences against the corresponding IGH RNA sequence libraries.
17241,1815,Heavy-chain CDR3 peptides were used as biomarkers to track serum RF clonotypes using quantitative multiple reaction monitoring.
17242,1815,"RESULTS: Serum RFs were clonally restricted and composed of shared sets of IgM heavy-chain variable region (Ig V(H) ) 1-69, 3-15, 3-7, and 3-74 subfamilies."
17243,1815,Cryoprecipitable RFs from patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) were distinguishable from nonprecipitating RFs by a higher frequency of amino acid substitutions and identification of stereotypic heavy-chain CDR3 transcripts.
17244,1815,Potentially pathogenic RF clonotypes were detected in serum by multiple reaction monitoring years before patients presented with MC.
17245,1815,Levels of Ig V(H) 4-34 IgM-RF decreased following immunosuppression and remission of MC.
17246,1815,"CONCLUSION: Cryoprecipitable RF clonotypes linked to vasculitis in primary SS have different molecular profiles than nonprecipitating RFs, suggesting different underlying mechanisms of production."
17247,1815,The combined omics workflow presented herein provides molecular biomarkers for tracking and removal of pathogenic RF clones.
17248,1816,"IgG4-related disease has been recently defined as a distinct clinic-pathologic entity, characterized by dense IgG-4 plasmacytic infiltration of diverse organs, fibrosis, and tumefactive lesions."
17249,1816,"Salivary and lacrimal glands are a target of this disease and, when affected, may clinically resemble Kttner tumor, Mikulicz disease, or orbital inflammatory pseudotumor."
17250,1816,"In some patients, the disease is systemic, with metachronous involvement of multiple organs, including the pancreas, aorta, kidneys, and biliary tract."
17251,1816,We report a 66-year-old man who presented with salivary gland enlargement and severe salivary hypofunction and was diagnosed with IgG4-related disease on the basis of a labial salivary gland biopsy.
17252,1816,"Additional features of his illness included a marked peripheral eosinophilia, obstructive pulmonary disease, and lymphoplasmacytic aortitis."
17253,1816,He was evaluated in the context of a research registry for Sjgren syndrome and was the only 1 of 2594 registrants with minor salivary gland histopathologic findings supportive of this diagnosis.
17254,1817,"When extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), a low grade B-cell lymphoma, arises in the lung it is referred to as bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) lymphoma."
17255,1817,We describe a patient with a history of Sjgren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis with dyspnea and imaging consistent with lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP).
17256,1817,"However, while histology and immunohistochemistry lacked definitive features of a lymphoma, immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) polymerase chain reaction testing demonstrated B-cell monoclonality, consistent with an early BALT lymphoma."
17257,1818,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease with broad clinical spectrum, extending from benign exocrinopathy to severe systemic disease and lymphoma development."
17258,1818,The glandular and extraglandular dysfunction of SS is associated with lymphocytic infiltrates that invade the epithelial structures of affected organs.
17259,1818,"The in-depth study of autoimmune lesions in the minor salivary glands (MSG), which are the major target-organ of SS responses, revealed that the lymphocytic infiltrates vary in severity and composition among SS-patients, are full-blown at diagnosis and remain unchanged thereafter."
17260,1818,"Although the pathogenetic pathways underlying SS have not yet elucidated, it is well-established that glandular epithelial cells are central regulators of local autoimmune responses."
17261,1818,"Moreover, chronic inflammation affects epithelial function and phenotype, which strengthens or weakens their immunoregulatory/secretory function, leading to deterioration of autoimmune phenomena."
17262,1818,"Herein, the current findings regarding the autoimmune lesions, the role of epithelial cells and their interaction with infiltrating lymphocytic cells are discussed."
17263,1819,OBJECTIVES: To assess Chlamydophila psittaci (Cp) subclinical infection in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
17264,1819,METHODS: Seventy-four SS patients (55.4 13.4 yrs; 94.6% females) were studied.
17265,1819,"Among them, 18 had salivary gland mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) B-cell lymphoma, 20 myoepithelial sialoadenitis (MESA), and 36 no lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD)."
17266,1819,The presence of Cp DNA was assessed in peripheral blood of all patients by specific PCR protocols.
17267,1819,"Paired salivary gland samples were also investigated whenever available (34 cases), including lymphomatous and non-lymphomatous samples, as well as major and minor salivary gland tissues."
17268,1819,"As controls, 225 blood donors were analysed in the peripheral blood."
17269,1819,"RESULTS: Overall, Cp DNA was detected in 11/74 (14.9%) SS patients vs. 1/225 (0.4%) controls (p<0.0001)."
17270,1819,"Cp was detected at higher frequency in MALT lymphoma patients (6/18, 33.3%), as compared with MESA (3/20, 15%) or patients without LPD (2/36, 5.6%), (MALT lymphomas vs. others: p=0.02)."
17271,1819,"A similar Cp prevalence was observed in blood vs. salivary gland tissues, however with a higher frequency in the major than in the minor salivary glands (5/18, 27.8%, vs. 1/17, 5.9%, p=0.18)."
17272,1819,"Cp-positive patients were all rheumatoid factor positive (11/11, 100% vs. 40/63, 63.5% Cp-negative; p=0.014), while no difference was noticed for anti-SSA/SSB positivity."
17273,1819,"CONCLUSIONS: In the light of accepted models of MALT B-cell lymphomagenesis and considering previous data implicating Cp infection in ocular adnexa MALT lymphoma, our results suggest that Cp infection could be involved also in a fraction of patients with SS developing lymphoma."
17274,1819,The potential therapeutic implications of these findings appear worthwhile.
17275,1820,"Primary cutaneous adenoid cystic carcinoma (PCACC) is a rare adnexal skin tumor first described in 1975, of which merely 62 cases have so far been studied in detail and reported in the English literature."
17276,1820,"PCACC is usually regarded as apocrine in origin/differentiation, but its precise histogenesis is still not well known."
17277,1820,"PCACC has in most cases a rather indolent course but can produce local recurrences and, more rarely, regional (lymph node) and distant (pulmonary) metastases."
17278,1820,"We report herein a Greek woman with a long-standing PCACC that grew slowly over several years and produced metastasis in the regional lymph nodes, highlighting the potentially aggressive course of this tumor."
17279,1820,"The primary and metastatic tumors were studied immunohistochemically and proved to express several (sweat gland-related) antigens (such as keratin 7, epithelial membrane antigen, CD10, and CD117) but neither hormonal receptors nor p63 or Gross Cystic disease Fluid Protein 15."
17280,1820,The salient clinicopathologic features of this rare cutaneous adnexal tumor are reviewed.
17281,1821,OBJECTIVES: Autoantibodies from the sera of Sjgren's syndrome patients (SS IgG) have been suggested to inhibit muscarinic receptor function.
17282,1821,"However, the acute nature of such an inhibitory effect remains controversial."
17283,1821,"In this study, we investigated the acute effects of SS IgG on muscarinic receptor function in human submandibular gland (HSG) cells."
17284,1821,"METHODS: The effects of autoantibodies on muscarinic receptor function were studied using microspectrofluorimetry, whole-cell patch clamp, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, and a co-immunoprecipitation assay."
17285,1821,RESULTS: Carbachol (CCh) was found to consistently increase intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+) ](i) ) and activate K(+) current in HSG cells.
17286,1821,"However, pretreatment of the cells with SS IgG for 5 or 30 min significantly attenuated these responses, with a substantially more prominent effect after 30 min of treatment."
17287,1821,"Like CCh, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) also increased [Ca(2+) ](i) and activated K(+) currents in HSG cells, although pretreatment with SS IgG did not affect the cellular response to ATP."
17288,1821,CCh was found to reorganize -fodrin in HSG cells in a Ca(2+) -dependent manner.
17289,1821,"However, pretreatment with SS IgG prevented the cytoskeletal reorganization of -fodrin induced by CCh."
17290,1821,"CONCLUSIONS: SS IgG acutely and reversibly inhibited muscarinic receptor function, thereby inhibiting the Ca(2+) mobilization necessary for the activation of K(+) currents and -fodrin reorganization in HSG cells."
17291,1822,"CONTEXT: Systemic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases often manifest oral lesions in their earliest stages, and early diagnosis, which may be spurred by a dental examination, is key for improved outcomes."
17292,1822,"After systemic diagnosis, oral lesions benefit from specialized care by dentists in collaboration with the medical team."
17293,1822,"This review aims to educate dental clinicians about the most relevant systemic autoimmune and inflammatory conditions with accompanying oral lesions, their implications for health, and management strategies supported by the biomedical literature and clinical experience."
17294,1822,"Ulcerative conditions including Behcet and Crohn diseases are discussed, along with rheumatic conditions including Sjgren syndrome, lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis."
17295,1822,EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Evidence was accumulated through PubMed searches using pertinent keywords for each subsection.
17296,1822,References were reviewed and original publications examined to verify the accuracy of the information.
17297,1822,We focused on evidence included in current reviews and randomized trials.
17298,1822,Recommendations were supported by multiple studies and consensus expert opinion.
17299,1822,EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Disease phenotypes described and clinical recommendations were synthesized from best-quality evidence available for each disease.
17300,1822,Efforts were made to describe evidence selection within each disease section.
17301,1822,CONCLUSIONS: Dentists play an important role in the early detection and multidisciplinary medical management of complex autoimmune diseases.
17302,1822,It is important to recognize prevalent medical and dental issues and special needs of patients with autoimmune conditions.
17303,1822,"The management of many inflammatory conditions is similar, and often begins with the use of topical steroids, analgesics, and antimicrobial treatments, in addition to careful attention to oral hygiene and appropriate fluoride usage."
17304,1822,"In this brief review, we aim to discuss the presentation/prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of oral manifestations encountered in autoimmune, autoinflammatory and systemic chronic inflammatory diseases."
17305,1822,Systemic autoimmune conditions are estimated to affect 5% to 8% of Americans.
17306,1822,"(1) Oral manifestations are encountered with high frequency, and are often the first clinical signs or symptoms of the general disease."
17307,1822,Optimal management of complex autoimmune diseases requires a multidisciplinary medical team including dentists to care for lesions of the oral cavity.
17308,1822,The dental practitioner may be asked to play a primary role in the diagnosis of such conditions and to participate with other health professionals working together to achieve effective clinical management.
17309,1822,"To aid in this process, we discuss in this article the current general knowledge of systemic autoimmune conditions that present with prevalent oral manifestations."
17310,1822,The focus is on the diagnosis and management of the oral component of each disease.
17311,1822,"Importantly, whereas the etiology and pathogenesis and systemic clinical presentation may vary, presentation in the oral cavity is often similar and many conditions involve oral ulcerations."
17312,1822,"For this reason, we discuss the differential diagnosis and management of the most common oral ulcerations in a general section and subsequently address individual conditions that present with oral ulcerations."
17313,1822,"Similarly, treatment of various autoimmune/inflammatory oral conditions is often common and involves modulation or suppression of the immune response locally and/or systemically and will be therefore addressed in a common section as well as individually for each disease when unique treatment regimens are recommended."
17314,1822,"We present here our general treatment recommendations based on clinical experience and literature review; however, it is critical that good clinical judgment and specifics of an individual case should determine the appropriate dental/oral medicine intervention for a specific patient."
17315,1823,"OBJECTIVES: To generate and validate at pretest level a cross-culturally adapted Portuguese version of Xerostomia Inventory (XI), a 11-item questionnaire designed to measure specific xerostomia rating of patients complaints."
17316,1823,METHODS: The original English version of the XI was translated into Portuguese following the guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation of health-related quality of life measures.
17317,1823,Thirty patients with primary Sjgren syndrome were recruited for this study.
17318,1823,The questionnaires were administered by trained and calibrated dental doctors to each patient.
17319,1823,"XI properties were examined including reliability, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability, using Cronbach's alpha, total and inter-item correlation, and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), respectively."
17320,1823,Construct validity supported by objective measurements of xerostomia intra-oral signs and salivary secretion was investigated.
17321,1823,Alpha was set at 0.05.
17322,1823,Informed consents and local ethical committee clearance were obtained.
17323,1823,RESULTS: Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were excellent (Cronbach's =0.9; ICC range=0.79-0.94).
17324,1823,"Scatterplot interpolation and Pearson correlation coefficient suggested the presence of a strong, negative, and significant correlation between salivation and the XI scores indicating construct validity."
17325,1823,CONCLUSION: The Portuguese version of the XI can be considered a reliable and valid instrument to measure patients' xerostomia symptoms.
17326,1824,"OBJECTIVE: To study and summarize the clinical features of hypophosphatemia osteomalacia (HO) misdiagnosed as spondyloarthritis (SpA), aiming to analyze the reasons of misdiagnosis and improve the prognosis of such patients."
17327,1824,METHODS: A total of 26 cases of HO misdiagnosed as SpA were selected.
17328,1824,"Clinical features, laboratory tests, and image presentations were analyzed."
17329,1824,Related literatures were reviewed.
17330,1824,RESULTS: (1) Clinical characters: 26 patients were included (12 males and 14 females) with a median age of 38 years (range 20-60).
17331,1824,The mean disease duration was 3.2 years (range 0.75 to 10 years).
17332,1824,"Of all the patients, 15 were diagnosed as tumor-induced HO, 4 were long-term oral adefovir dipivoxil-related HO, 3 were associated with Fanconi syndrome, 2 were related to hyperparathyroidism, while 2 were Sjogren's syndrome complicated with renal tubular acidosis."
17333,1824,All of the 26 patients presented with low back pain including 15 with night pain.
17334,1824,The time of morning stiffness was about 30 minutes.
17335,1824,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were given to each patient whereas with poor efficacy, neither did other agents work well, such as glucocorticoids, disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and biologics."
17336,1824,"(2) LABORATORY FINDINGS: the platelet count and inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP) were usually normal."
17337,1824,"The level of serum calcium was normal or slightly lower, nevertheless, all patients had hypophosphatemia and increased level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP)."
17338,1824,"Patients with adefovir dipivoxil-related HO, Fanconi syndrome or Sjogren's syndrome complicated with renal tubular acidosis were characterized by hypokalemia, hyperchloremia and alkaline urine."
17339,1824,Patients with hyperparathyroidism had elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH).
17340,1824,"Positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (titer  1: 320), anti-SSA/SSB antibodies were found in patients with Sjogren's syndrome."
17341,1824,"(3) Radiographic features: sacroiliac joint lesions were found in X-ray, CT, positron emission tomography (PET-CT) or MRI, however the lesions in sacrum or ilium were predominant rather than in joints."
17342,1824,"Abnormal bone imaging in ribs, long bones and soft tissues in addition to joints could be detected by bone scintigraphy."
17343,1824,CONCLUSION: HO is not uncommon in daily practice.
17344,1824,"Besides SpA, other diseases should be considered in the setting of low-back pain and diseased sacroiliac joints."
17345,1824,Comprehensive screening of bone metabolic parameters contributes to the timely diagnosis of HO.
17346,1825,Systemic rheumatic diseases are characterized by abnormal B cell activation with autoantibody production and hypergammaglobulinaemia.
17347,1825,"Ro52/SSA, also denoted tripartite motif (TRIM)21, is a major autoantigen in Sjgren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus."
17348,1825,"Interestingly, TRIM21-deficient mice develop systemic autoimmunity with B cell-driven manifestations such as autoantibodies, hypergammaglobulinaemia and glomerulonephritis following tissue injury."
17349,1825,"The mechanisms by which TRIM21-deficiency leads to enhanced B cell activation and antibody production are, however, not well understood, and to further elucidate the role of TRIM21 in systemic autoimmunity, we investigated the B cell phenotype and antibody responses of Trim21(-/-) mice following immunization with thymus-dependent (TD) and thymus-independent (TI) antigens."
17350,1825,"We found that TRIM21-deficient mice developed significantly higher specific antibody titres than their wild-type counterparts upon B cell receptor (BCR) engagement by TD and TI type II antigens, and this was accompanied by an altered B cell phenotype."
17351,1825,"Furthermore, BCR cross-linking, but not anti-CD40 stimulation, in vitro resulted in a significantly higher proliferation of Trim21(-/-) cells."
17352,1825,"We also observed that splenic follicular B cells were expanded not only in immunized mice but also already in young, unmanipulated Trim21(-/-) mice, and transcriptomic analysis of these cells revealed an up-regulation of genes associated with B cell differentiation, indicating a role for TRIM21 in their regulation."
17353,1825,"In conclusion, in this study we describe a link between the rheumatic autoantigen Ro52/TRIM21 and increased antibody production associated with follicular B cell expansion, implicating a potential role for Ro52/TRIM21 in the pathogenesis of systemic autoimmune diseases."
17354,1826,The term undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) refers to unclassifiable systemic autoimmune diseases which share clinical and serological manifestations with definite connective tissue diseases (CTDs) but not fulfilling any of the existing classification criteria.
17355,1826,"In this review we will go through the more recent evidence on UCTD and we will discuss in what extent the availability of new criteria for the CTDs could interfere with the ""UCTD concept""."
17356,1826,"The development of criteria able to identify early phases of defined CTD, may help in the differentiation of stable UCTD form their early stages and may offer a valuable guide to the treating physician to set up appropriate follow up schedules as well as therapeutic protocols."
17357,1826,This simplified subset of CTD could offer a model to study clinic pathological correlations as well as the role of possible environmental factors in the development of autoimmunity.
17358,1827,A human La/Sjgren's syndrome-B (hLa)-specific TCR/hLa neo-self-Ag double-transgenic (Tg) mouse model was developed and used to investigate cellular tolerance and autoimmunity to the ubiquitous RNA-binding La Ag often targeted in systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjgren's syndrome.
17359,1827,Extensive thymic clonal deletion of CD4(+) T cells occurred in H-2(k/k) double-Tg mice presenting high levels of the I-E(k)-restricted hLa T cell epitope.
17360,1827,"In contrast, deletion was less extensive in H-2(k/b) double-Tg mice presenting lower levels of the epitope, and some surviving thymocytes were positively selected as thymic regulatory T cells (tTreg)."
17361,1827,These mice remained serologically tolerant to hLa and healthy.
17362,1827,"H-2(k/b) double-Tg mice deficient of all endogenous Tcra genes, a deficiency known to impair Treg development and function, produced IgG anti-hLa autoantibodies and displayed defective tTreg development."
17363,1827,"These autoimmune mice had interstitial lung disease characterized by lymphocytic aggregates containing Tg T cells with an activated, effector memory phenotype."
17364,1827,Salivary gland infiltrates were notably absent.
17365,1827,"Thus, expression of nuclear hLa Ag induces thymic clonal deletion and tTreg selection, and lymphocytic infiltration of the lung is a consequence of La-specific CD4(+) T cell autoimmunity."
17366,1828,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the lipoprotein profile of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) and its association with laboratory tests, including markers of inflammation."
17367,1828,METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study among patients with pSS and healthy controls.
17368,1828,We analyzed the lipoprotein profile of 73 pSS patients compared to 65 healthy individuals in the control group.
17369,1828,"We further evaluated possible associations between dyslipidemia in pSS patients and laboratory parameters including: hypergammaglobulinemia, autoantibodies [antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-Ro, anti-La], and acute-phase reactants [C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)]."
17370,1828,RESULTS: Patients and controls were comparable regarding the demographic variables.
17371,1828,"Lipoprotein profile was similar between pSS patients and controls: total cholesterol (204.0+/-43.39 versus 206.5+/-42.76 mg/mL, P=0.73), LDL fraction (131.6+/-37.38 versus 130.62+/-38.24 mg/dL, P=0.88) and HDL fraction (49.7+/-13.5 versus 51+/-11.5mg/dL, P=0.56), triglycerides (129.3+/-81.0 versus 116.8+/-53.5mg/dL, P=0.29)."
17372,1828,"However, patients with pSS had a strong trend to present dyslipidemia when compared to healthy individuals (76.7% versus 61.5%, P=0.06)."
17373,1828,"The presence of dyslipidemia in pSS was associated with increased ESR (44.05+/-28.07 versus 28.28+/-18.00, P=0.03), but not with other laboratory markers of the disease and inflammation."
17374,1828,"DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: pSS patients frequently present abnormal lipid profile, which are associated with higher levels of ESR."
17375,1828,"Thus, similar to other systemic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), lipid profile should be evaluated in pSS patients, with the aim of initiating specific therapeutic strategy for prevention of cardiovascular events."
17376,1829,INTRODUCTION: The presence of circulating Ro/SSA and La/SSB autoantibodies has become an important marker in the classification criteria for primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
17377,1829,Plasma cells producing these autoantibodies are mainly high affinity plasma cells originating from germinal centre reactions.
17378,1829,When exposed to the right microenvironment these autoimmune plasma cells become long-lived and resistant to immunosuppressive treatment.
17379,1829,"Since autoimmune plasma cells have been detected in the salivary glands of SS patients, we wanted to investigate if the glandular microenvironment is suitable for plasma cell survival and if glandular residing plasma cells are the long-lived plasma cell subset."
17380,1829,"METHODS: Single, double and triple immunohistochemistry as well as immunofluorescence staining was performed on minor salivary gland tissue retrieved from pSS, chronically inflamed and normal subjects."
17381,1829,"RESULTS: We detected significant numbers of CD138+, non-proliferating, Bcl-2 expressing plasma cells in the salivary glands of pSS patients with high focus score (FS)."
17382,1829,"Furthermore, we demonstrated that CXCL12 and interleukin (IL)-6 survival factors were highly expressed in pSS salivary gland epithelium and by focal mononuclear infiltrating cells."
17383,1829,"Notably, adipocytes when present in the salivary gland tissue were an important source of CXCL12."
17384,1829,We clearly demonstrate that plasma cells are localised in close proximity to CXCL12 and IL-6 expressing cells and thus that the environment of salivary glands with high FS provide factors vital for plasma cell survival.
17385,1829,CONCLUSIONS: Plasma cells residing in the salivary glands of pSS patients with high FS showed phenotypic characteristics of the long-lived plasma cell subtype.
17386,1829,"Furthermore, the pSS salivary gland microenvironment provided niches rich in factors vital for plasma cell survival."
17387,1830,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Lymphocytic hidradenitis is a non-specific histopathological feature observed in many dermatoses such as lupus erythematosus, morphea or scleroderma."
17388,1830,When it occurs it is usually accompanied by the other distinctive histological features of those conditions.
17389,1830,Isolated lymphocytic hidradenitis is uncommon and its clinical features and associated underlying medical conditions are still undetermined.
17390,1830,METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients who clinically presented with annular erythema between 2000 and 2016.
17391,1830,"Altogether, 30 patients with a histopathological presentation of isolated lymphocytic hidradenitis were identified."
17392,1830,"Their following characteristics were recorded: clinical features, number and localisation of lesions, serology and other associated medical conditions."
17393,1830,RESULTS: Isolated lymphocytic hidradenitis was found most frequently in middle-aged women.
17394,1830,"Most patients (n=28, 93%) presented with many annular erythematous patches and plaques with mild pruritus; 22 (73%) had the SS-A antibody and 17 (57%) met the diagnostic criteria of Sjgren syndrome."
17395,1830,"Among these patients, 11 had primary and six had secondary Sjgren syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus."
17396,1830,Altogether 15 (50%) patients tested positive for a high titre of the antinuclear autoantibody.
17397,1830,"Other underlying diseases identified during the follow-up period include cryoglobulinaemia, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis C infection and toxic thyroid goitre."
17398,1830,CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocytic hidradenitis is a microscopic finding associated with annular erythemas of Sjgren syndrome.
17399,1830,"Systemic survey for sicca symptoms and work up for autoimmune diseases, including antinuclear antibodies, SS-A, SS-B antibodies, cryoglobulin, lymphoma, viral and autoimmune hepatitis should be performed to facilitate the correct diagnosis."
17400,1831,Primary Sjgren syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease mainly affecting the exocrine glands causing a sicca syndrome.
17401,1831,Neurological manifestations are rarely seen in SS although they are debilitating.
17402,1831,Peripheral neuropathies namely sensory axonal neuropathy and painful small fiber neuropathy are the most frequent neurological manifestations.
17403,1831,Sensory neuronopathy (SN) is less frequently seen although leading to more severe handicap.The aim of the study was to analyze the clinical presentation and treatment efficacy in a series of SS-related SN.We retrospectively studied patients with SS fulfilling the American-European Classification Criteria and SN according to recent criteria.
17404,1831,"Studied variables were neurological findings, associated autoimmune diseases, biological profiles, nerve conduction and sensory/motor amplitudes study, treatments received, and outcomes."
17405,1831,"Handicap scores were studied at beginning and end of each treatment using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).Thirteen patients were included (12 women, 1 man; median age 55 years at SN diagnosis) presenting with SN with a median follow-up of 3 years (range 2-17)."
17406,1831,"In 11 patients, SN preceded or coincided with SS diagnosis."
17407,1831,Most common neurological findings were ataxia and areflexia followed by paresthesia and pain.
17408,1831,"Lower limbs were more affected than upper limbs, neurological deficits were often symmetric and cranial nerves were affected in 3 patients."
17409,1831,"Seven patients were treated with corticosteroids, 7 with mycophenolate mofetil, 6 with hydroxychloroquine, 5 with intravenous immunoglobulins, 4 with cyclophosphamide, and 2 patients received other immunosuppressive drugs."
17410,1831,"At the beginning and at the end of follow-up, average mRS was 2.15 (median 2) and 2.38 (median 2), respectively.SS-related SN progression is heterogeneous but tends to be chronic, insidious, and debilitating despite treatment."
17411,1831,"From these data concerning a small number of patients, treatment strategies with corticosteroids in association with immunosuppressive drugs, namely mycophenolate mofetil, had positive results."
17412,1831,"In contrast, intravenous immunoglobulins had disappointing results."
17413,1832,Anti-muscarinic type 3 receptor autoantibodies (anti-M3R) are reported as potential inhibitors of saliva secretion in Sjgren's syndrome (SjS).
17414,1832,"However, despite extensive efforts to establish an anti-M3R detection method, there is no clinical test available for these autoantibodies."
17415,1832,The purpose of this study was to propose inclusion of anti-M3R testing for SjS diagnosis through investigation of their prevalence using a modified In-Cell Western (ICW) assay.
17416,1832,"A stable cell line expressing human M3R tagged with GFP (M3R-GFP) was established to screen unadsorbed and adsorbed plasma from primary SjS (n=24), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=18), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n=18), and healthy controls (HC, n=23)."
17417,1832,"Anti-M3R abundance was determined by screening for the intensity of human IgG interacting with M3R-GFP cells by ICW assay, as detected by an anti-human IgG IRDye800-conjugated secondary antibody and normalized to GFP."
17418,1832,Method comparisons and receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC)-curve analyses were performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of our current approaches.
17419,1832,"Furthermore, clinical parameters of SjS were also analyzed in association with anti-M3R."
17420,1832,"Anti-M3R was significantly elevated in SjS plasma in comparison with HC, SLE, or RA (P<0.01)."
17421,1832,"SjS anti-M3R intensities were greater than two-standard deviations above the HC mean for both unadsorbed (16/24, 66.67%) and adsorbed (18/24, 75%) plasma samples."
17422,1832,"Furthermore, anti-M3R was associated with anti-SjS-related-antigen A/Ro positivity (P=0.0353)."
17423,1832,"Linear associations for anti-M3R intensity indicated positive associations with focus score (R(2)=0.7186, P<0.01) and negative associations with saliva flow rate (R(2)=0.3052, P<0.05)."
17424,1832,Our study strongly supports our rationale to propose inclusion of anti-M3R for further testing as a non-invasive serological marker for SjS diagnosis.
17425,1833,"PURPOSE: To report the clinical outcome of the treatment of dry eyes using 0.03% tacrolimus eye drops (olive oil + tacrolimus 0.03%) (Ophthalmos, Sao Paulo, Brazil)."
17426,1833,"METHODS: Sixteen eyes of 8 patients with Sjgren syndrome dry eyes (age, 51.13  9.45 years) were enrolled in this study (prospective noncontrolled interventional case series)."
17427,1833,Patients were instructed to use topical 0.03% tacrolimus eye drops twice a day (every 12 hours) in the lower conjunctival sac.
17428,1833,"Schirmer I test, break-up time, corneal fluorescein, and rose bengal staining score were performed in all patients 1 day before, and 14, 28, and 90 days after treatment with 0.03% tacrolimus eye drops."
17429,1833,RESULTS: The average fluorescein staining and rose bengal staining scores improved statistically significantly after 14 days of treatment and improved even more after 28 and 90 days.
17430,1833,"The average Schirmer I test did not improve statistically significantly after 28 days of treatment, although we did observe a significant improvement after 90 days of treatment with 0.03% tacrolimus eye drops."
17431,1833,"The average break-up time did not improve statistically after 14 days of treatment, although we observed a significant improvement after 28 and 90 days of treatment with 0.03% tacrolimus eye drops."
17432,1833,CONCLUSIONS: Topical 0.03% tacrolimus eye drops successfully improved tear stability and ocular surface status in patients with dry eyes.
17433,1834,"OBJECTIVES: For the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS), cut-off levels of 2-microglobulin (2MG) and sodium (Na+) in unstimulated whole saliva have not yet been shown."
17434,1834,We aimed to determine the cut-off levels of salivary 2MG and Na+ which differentiate SS patients from non-SS patients and healthy controls.
17435,1834,"METHODS: Seventy-one patients of primary SS (pSS, 69 females/2 males, 60.016.8 years old), 50 of secondary SS (sSS, 49/1, 55.817.4), 54 of connective tissue diseases other than SS (non-SS-CTD, 43/11, 60.016.0), and 75 healthy volunteers (HC, 43/32, 50.715.6) were included."
17436,1834,"Unstimulated whole saliva were examined for levels of 2MG, Na+, potassium (K+), and chloride (Cl-)."
17437,1834,Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was carried out.
17438,1834,"RESULTS: 2MG, Na+, and Cl- levels in the SS group (pSS and sSS) were significantly higher than those in the non-SS group (non-SS-CTD and HC)."
17439,1834,"The salivary 2MG level was 5.34.6 mg/L in pSS, 5.12.0 in sSS, 2.52.1 in non-SS-CTD, and 1.20.7 in HC, respectively."
17440,1834,"The Na+ level was 39.225.2 mEq/L, 36.426.1, 19.616.8, and 16.57.3, and the Cl- level was 51.125.0, 47.824.3, 32.116.6, and 27.07.9 in the same order."
17441,1834,The K+ level in the SS group was significantly higher than that in HC.
17442,1834,The optimal cut-off 2 MG and Na+ levels that differentiate the SS group from the non-SS group were 2.3 mg/L and 23 mEq/L.
17443,1834,CONCLUSIONS: Salivary 2MG and Na+ levels are useful markers for differentiating SS patients from non-SS-CTD patients and HC.
17444,1835,INTRODUCTION: Adult onset Still's disease is a rare affection classified among non-hereditary autoinflammatory diseases.
17445,1835,We here report a case of AOSD revealed during pregnancy with a life-threatening presentation along with a review of 19 cases from literature.
17446,1835,CASE: A 38-years old woman was treated in our department for diffuse systemic sclerosis and associated Sjgren syndrome.
17447,1835,She was pregnant and presented with acute fever and arthralgias.
17448,1835,Laboratory data revealed mild liver cytolysis but a large screening for infectious and auto-immune diseases was negative and hepato-biliar imaging was normal.
17449,1835,Ferritin levels were at 41 000 ng/mL with glycosylated ferritin less than 5%.
17450,1835,"The diagnosis of AOSD was stated and because of persistent fever and polyarthralgias, after exclusion of active infection, steroids were started (prednisone 1 mg/kg) associated with colchicine, which allowed clinical remission and C-reactive protein significant decrease."
17451,1835,"CONCLUSION: Pregnancy-revealed AOSD appears to be a specifical subset of the disease with a systemic course, flares on first and second trimester, obstetrical complications such as prematurity and IUGR sometimes leading to life-threatening situations requiring parenteral corticotherapy and intravenous immunoglobulins."
17452,1836,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify the association of carotid atherosclerosis with the traditional risk factors, disease features, cytokine profile, and calprotectin in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
17453,1836,"METHODS: 63 primary pSS patients and 63 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent carotid ultrasound, clinical and laboratory examination."
17454,1836,The presence of carotid plaques was taken as carotid atherosclerosis.
17455,1836,The covariates of carotid atherosclerosis were identified in univariate and multivariate regressions.
17456,1836,"RESULTS: Patients with pSS had higher prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis (13% vs. 2%, p<0.05) and higher serum levels of calprotectin, tumour necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNF-R2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) than controls."
17457,1836,"Sex, menopause, and the prevalence of traditional cardiovascular did not differ between groups (all p>0.05)."
17458,1836,"In univariate analyses, serum calprotectin, most traditional cardiovascular (age, male sex, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, hypertriglyceridaemia, and serum creatinine), and some disease-associated risk factors (glucocorticoid or saliva substitute use, constitutional domain of Eular-Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index - EULAR) were associated with a higher risk for plaque."
17459,1836,"In a multivariate analysis, having pSS and higher serum calprotectin were associated with carotid atherosclerosis independent of traditional risk factors."
17460,1836,"CONCLUSIONS: pSS have a higher prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis, which is associated with higher serum calprotectin level independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors."
17461,1836,Our findings suggest calprotectin as a biomarker of subclinical atherosclerosis in pSS.
17462,1837,OBJECTIVES: Primary SS is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic lymphocytic inflammation and ectopic germinal centre (GC) formation within salivary glands.
17463,1837,"Fractalkine (CX3CL1), associated with the pathogenesis of RA, is the sole member of the CX3C chemokine (CK) family and acts as an adhesion and chemotactic molecule."
17464,1837,The objectives of this work are to determine to what extent CX3CL1 and its receptor CX3CR1 expression might be altered in salivary glands obtained from patients and to establish whether these CKs might be involved in SS ectopic lymphoneogenesis.
17465,1837,"METHODS: We assessed the presence of CX3CL1 protein in sera by ELISA in 21 patients with primary SS, 11 patients with Sicca syndrome (Sicca), 20 RA patients and 10 blood donors."
17466,1837,Histological evaluation was performed on sequential sections of salivary gland tissue.
17467,1837,Using TaqMan RT-PCR we studied CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 mRNA expression in salivary gland tissues from a molecular point of view.
17468,1837,"RESULTS: Increased serum levels of CX3CL1 protein were observed in SS patients compared with controls (P < 0.0001) and in RA patients compared with controls (P < 0.0001), but no difference was found between Sicca patients and controls (P = 0.22)."
17469,1837,We identified histologically the cells expressing CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 in salivary glands of SS patients and we localized the molecule within tertiary lymphoid structures.
17470,1837,"Finally, the mRNA levels of the CK and its receptor were up-regulated in SS salivary glands."
17471,1837,CONCLUSION: We believe that our findings point to the need for future studies on CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 proteins as contributors to the formation of ectopic GCs and possibly as a new tool in the evaluation and diagnosis of SS.
17472,1838,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration, destruction of lacrimal and salivary glands and the presence of serum autoantibodies."
17473,1838,"Most women that suffer from SS are post-menopausal however, not all post-menopausal women develop SS, suggesting that other factors, in addition to the decrease in ovarian hormones, are necessary for the development of SS."
17474,1838,"The purposes of this study were to investigate a) the time course of lymphocytic infiltration and apoptosis in the lacrimal gland after ovariectomy, b) if a predisposed genetic background for SS aggravates the effects of decreasing levels of sex hormones in the lacrimal glands and c) if physiological doses of estrogen or androgen prevent the effects observed after ovariectomy."
17475,1838,"Six weeks old mice that are genetically predisposed to SS (NOD.B10.H2(b)) and control (C57BL/10) mice were either sham operated, ovariectomized (OVX), OVX+17 estradiol (E(2)) or OVX+Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)."
17476,1838,"Lacrimal glands were collected at 3, 7, 21 or 30 days after surgery and processed for immunohistochemistry to measure CD4(+), CD8(+) T cells, B220(+) B cells, nuclear DNA degradation and cleaved caspase-3 activity."
17477,1838,Quantification of the staining was done by light microscopy and Image Pro Plus software.
17478,1838,The results of our study show that lymphocytic infiltration preceded lacrimal gland apoptosis after ovariectomy.
17479,1838,"Moreover, removal of ovarian sex hormones accelerated these effects in the genetically predisposed animal and these effects were more severe and persistent compared to control animals."
17480,1838,"In addition, sex hormone replacement at physiological levels prevented these symptoms."
17481,1838,The mechanisms by which decreased levels of sex hormones caused lymphocytic infiltration and apoptosis and the interaction of lack of sex hormones with the genetic elements remain to be elucidated.
17482,1839,Type I interferons (IFN) are a class of inducible and protective cytokines best known for immune defence against viruses and intracellular bacteria.
17483,1839,Inappropriate stimulation or defective negative regulation of type I IFN expression however can lead to persistent type I IFN activity with detrimental effects.
17484,1839,"This is particularly relevant for a class of monogenic autoinflammatory diseases (""type I interferonopathies""), along with many other complex rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis (DM), systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
17485,1839,"Direct detection of type I interferon protein in biologic samples has proved challenging, thus indirect methods are often used to infer the presence of type I IFN via quantification of antiviral activity and/or induced expression of IFN-responsive genes."
17486,1839,"While some of these methods have been used to inform clinical care, none have proven feasible for everyday clinical practice."
17487,1839,"However, with new technologies emerging, this may soon change."
17488,1839,"This review provides a brief summary of the available methods to gauge the presence of type I IFN and their application for the improved understanding, diagnosis and monitoring of type I interferonopathies and other rheumatic diseases."
17489,1840,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the difference in clinical features and radiologic findings between patients with cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) and connective tissue disorder related organizing pneumonia (CTD-OP).
17490,1840,"METHODS: A total of 30 subjects with COP and 22 subjects with CTD-OP collected from 2005 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed in the Affiliated Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, and the diagnosis of all patients were confirmed by lung biopsy."
17491,1840,"RESULTS: The common underlying diseases in patients with CTD-OP were Sjogren syndrome(SS), poly-/dermatomyositis(PM/DM), rheumatoid arthritis (RA)."
17492,1840,There were no significant differences in clinical manifestations between CTD-OP and COP.
17493,1840,"Compared with COP patients, the proportion of female patients was higher in CTD-OP."
17494,1840,Higher positive rate for ANA was found in CTD-OP group (CTD-OP:63.6%; COP:10.0%; P<0.01).
17495,1840,There were no significant differences in parameters of lung function between CTD-OP and COP.
17496,1840,"As to radiological findings, the most common patterns were multiple patchy, linear shadows and ground-glass opacity."
17497,1840,Some patients showed solitary nodule or consolidation and pleural effusion.
17498,1840,Reticular shadow was a rare pattern among these patients.
17499,1840,Most lesions were under the pleura and/or around the bronchus.
17500,1840,"CONCLUSIONS: There are no significant differences in clinical and radiologic manifestations between COP and CTD-OP, except that the proportion of women and ANA positive rate were higher in CTD-OP."
17501,1841,OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to determine the frequency and the clinical significance of autoantibodies to the pericentromeric heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1).
17502,1841,So far this antinuclear antibody specificity has been mainly reported in patients with the CREST syndrome.
17503,1841,"METHODS: We screened the sera of 199 individuals, including patients suffering from various autoimmune disorders (Group I, n=145) and non autoimmune diseases (Group II, n=44 patients) as well as healthy individuals (Group III, n=30)."
17504,1841,The sera were systematically tested by Western blot and ELISA using a GST-HP1 fusion protein as an antigen.
17505,1841,"RESULTS: Anti-HP1 antibodies were detected in 32% of patients in Group I, 11.3% in Group II and 3.3% of individuals in Group III."
17506,1841,They could be detected in sera containing or not antinuclear antibodies detectable by indirect immunofluorescence.
17507,1841,"Anti-HP1 antibodies were mostly associated with the CREST and Sjogren's syndromes (70% and 44.4%, respectively)."
17508,1841,They could also be detected in 22.2% of patients suffering from various other autoimmune diseases.
17509,1841,"However, their negative predictive value was 94% in the CREST syndrome."
17510,1841,CONCLUSION: Anti-HP1 autoantibodies are associated with a large spectrum of disorders.
17511,1841,"However, they have a diagnostic value in the CREST syndrome."
17512,1842,Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are potent autoantigenic targets in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD).
17513,1842,Loss of tolerance to the RA33 complex consisting of hnRNP A2 and its alternatively spliced variants B1 and B2 has been the interest of rheumatologists.
17514,1842,"A novel ELISA for the detection of anti-hnRNP B1 autoantibodies has been developed to investigate the prevalence thereof in 397 patients with SARD, including patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthropathy (SPA), juvenile chronic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and Sjgren's syndrome (SS), in comparison to 174 controls."
17515,1842,"Anti-hnRNP B1 autoantibodies were significantly more prevalent in patients with SARD than controls (47/397, 11.8% versus 2/174, 1.1%; P<0.001)."
17516,1842,"In particular, anti-hnRNP B1 were found more frequently in the disease cohorts than in the controls and were present in 24/165 (14.5%) patients with RA, 6/58 (10.3%) SPA, 11/65 (16.9%) SSc, and 4/50 (8.0%) SLE."
17517,1842,"In RA patients, anti-hnRNP B1 autoantibodies correlated significantly with C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, while in patients with SSc it was associated with features of arterial wall stiffness and presence of hypertension."
17518,1842,Anti-hnRNP B1 autoantibodies occur in SARD and seem to be correlated with distinct clinical characteristics in patients with RA and SSc.
17519,1843,The management of patients suffering from primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) has long been mainly symptomatic and demonstration of effectiveness of systemic drugs was lacking.
17520,1843,"However, progress made in the understanding of pSS pathogenesis has allowed moving into a more targeted approach to therapeutic intervention."
17521,1843,"Given the key role of chronic B-cell activation, B-cell target therapies were the first candidates."
17522,1843,"New pathways are currently being investigated, including costimulation and ectopic germinal center."
17523,1843,"In this review, we summarize the current evidence regarding B-cell targeted and anti-TNF therapies and provide an overview of promising drugs in the pipeline."
17524,1844,"A 58-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with anti-signal recognition particle (SRP)-positive dermatomyositis associated with Sjgren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and lung adenocarcinoma."
17525,1844,"She presented with cutaneous lesions, including ulceration of her right middle finger."
17526,1844,Tissue specimens obtained from her right deltoid muscle were positive for CD4(+) T-cell infiltration and the sarcolemma showed the upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens.
17527,1844,The present case suggests that overlapping autoimmune diseases or complications of malignancy may result in an atypical clinical presentations and histological findings in patients with anti-SRP antibody-positive dermatomyositis.
17528,1845,OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation between labial salivary gland focus score (FS) and severity of Sjgren's syndrome patients.
17529,1845,"METHODS: From January 2009 to December 2010, a total of 77 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome were recruited to undergo minor salivary gland biopsy, Schirmer's test, unstimulated whole salivary flow, organ function and serological test."
17530,1845,Focus score was calculated for all biopsy samples.
17531,1845,And the correlation between focus score and serological test and organ function damage was evaluated.
17532,1845,"RESULTS: Their pathological examinations revealed focal lymphocytic sialadenitis (n = 62), 10 cases with non-specific or sclerosing chronic sialadenitis (n = 10) and normal features (n = 5)."
17533,1845,"Among 62 cases with focal lymphocytic sialadenitis, 46 cases had FS  1 and another 16 FS < 1."
17534,1845,The median FS was 2.4  2.5 .
17535,1845,"FS  1 was strongly associated with unstimulated whole salivary flow rates and ocular staining score (P < 0.05), but not significantly with dry mouth or eyes."
17536,1845,"FS was significantly correlated with serum immunoglobin G (IgG), immunoglobin M (IgM) and rheumatoid factor level (P < 0.05)."
17537,1845,Those with positive anti-SSA had higher FS level than those with negative anti-SSA antibody (P < 0.05).
17538,1845,"In addition, FS level was not significantly associated with organ function damage."
17539,1845,"CONCLUSION: Prior to determining FS, distinguishing focal lymphocytic sialadenitis from other types of sialadenitis is essential in assessing salivary gland biopsy."
17540,1845,And the FS level might be associated with disease activity and positive anti-SSA.
17541,1845,No correlation exists between FS and organ function damage.
17542,1846,OBJECTIVE: Patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) are at greater risk of developing lymphoma.
17543,1846,This study was undertaken to evaluate whether the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt-3L) might be associated with lymphoma in primary SS.
17544,1846,METHODS: Serum levels of Flt-3L were measured in 369 patients with primary SS from the French Assessment of Systemic Signs and Evolution of Sjgren's Syndrome study cohort and in 10 patients with primary SS at the time of lymphoma diagnosis in an Italian cohort.
17545,1846,"Associations between increased levels of Flt-3L and a history of lymphoma, history of previously diagnosed criteria related to a high risk of lymphoma, and greater extent of disease activity were evaluated."
17546,1846,"RESULTS: Among patients with primary SS, higher levels of Flt-3L were significantly associated with a history of lymphoma (P = 0.0001)."
17547,1846,"Previous markers for risk of lymphoma development, such as presence of purpura, low levels of C4, presence of lymphocytopenia, low levels of IgM, high levels of 2 -microglobulin, and a higher primary SS disease activity score, were all associated with higher levels of Flt-3L."
17548,1846,The levels of Flt-3L were also increased in serum obtained from patients with primary SS at the time of lymphoma diagnosis.
17549,1846,"Furthermore, the Flt-3L levels were elevated in the serum of 6 patients up to 94 months (mean 46 months) prior to the diagnosis of lymphoma."
17550,1846,"Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that an Flt-3L level of 175 pg/ml was the ideal cutoff value for demonstrating an association with lymphoma (specificity 97.5%, sensitivity 44%, negative predictive value 97%)."
17551,1846,"CONCLUSION: Flt-3L is associated with lymphoma in primary SS, and constitutes a good biologic marker."
17552,1846,"Higher levels of this cytokine are present several years before the diagnosis of lymphoma, and may be useful as a predictive marker of lymphoproliferative disorders in primary SS."
17553,1847,"Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is characterized by infiltration of exocrine glands with T and B lymphocytes, leading to glandular dysfunction and frequently accompanied by hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibodies."
17554,1847,"The role of T cells, which predominate in the lesions, has attracted much interest."
17555,1847,"CD4 T cells seem to be responding to autoantigens on apoptotic cells, such as the Ro and La antigens, or to the cytoskeletal antigen -fodrin."
17556,1847,Physical injury to ocular surfaces may also lead to T cell mediated responses to self antigens and perpetuate disease.
17557,1847,"Within the salivary glands, T cell responsiveness is further promoted by the special capacity of salivary epithelial tissue to provide costimulation and enhanced antigen presentation."
17558,1847,"Cytokines are key mediators of the T cell contribution to pathology, with roles attributed both to Th1 and Th2 cells."
17559,1847,"Recently, striking data implicate Th17 cells in the stimulation of B cells, and a role for the related cytokine IL-21 produced by follicular T helper cells is now appreciated."
17560,1847,Dysfunction of T regulatory cells has been shown to have a role in the exuberant production of cytokines by Th17 cells.
17561,1847,"Beyond their role in provoking B cell hyperactivity and immunoglobulin secretion, T cells are directly involved in destruction of glands through Fas and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity."
17562,1847,Animal models of SS have confirmed the role of T cell derived cytokines in disease and support a role for effector-memory cells in pathogenesis.
17563,1847,"Further elucidation of the role of T cells will open avenues for better treatment of SS, whose current management is still mainly supportive."
17564,1848,A 62-year-old woman with Sjogren syndrome was admitted for computed tomographic (CT) evaluation of a thickened trachea and parotid tumor.
17565,1848,"She had been given a diagnosis of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma 6 years previously, and had undergone surgical resection of the parotid tumor."
17566,1848,Endoscopic examination revealed an annular tumor that had formed a stricture in the mid-trachea.
17567,1848,Pathologic specimens were obtained by surgical resection of the parotid tumor and bronchoscopic biopsy of the tracheal tumor.
17568,1848,Both histological examinations revealed MALT-type marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.
17569,1848,"Because CD20 immunostaining was positive, the patient received 6 cycles of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) without any signs of major toxicity."
17570,1848,"All lesions disappeared after treatment, and this patient remained disease-free for 40 months."
17571,1849,Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is reported in about 50% of patients.
17572,1849,"Among the neuropsychiatric features of SLE, myelopathy, including acute transverse myelitis (ATM) or acute longitudinal myelitis (ALM), represents an uncommon event."
17573,1849,A possible vascular aetiology of SLE myelopathies has been hypothesized and it seems to be much more associated to SLE-associated antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).
17574,1849,"Furthermore, a possible infectious cause of ATM or ALM in healthy subjects has been described."
17575,1849,SLE patients are susceptible to infection due to the disease itself or to the immunosuppressive therapy.
17576,1849,Cryptococci non-neoformans have been rarely associated to infections in humans.
17577,1849,Here we describe the case of a 47-year-old woman with SLE and Sjgren Syndrome who developed an ALM concurrently with a Cryptococcus laurentii pneumonia.
17578,1849,"The patient was treated with antimycotics, high doses of glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulins with a significant clinical and radiological improvement."
17579,1849,"As far as we know, this is the first case of Cryptococcus laurentii infection and ALM in a patient with SLE who later developed a seronegative APS."
17580,1849,"Even though myelopathy may be considered primarily associated to SLE, a possible role of the infection in ALM development cannot be excluded."
17581,1850,INTRODUCTION: To determine the prevalence and clinical/laboratory associations of subclinical atherosclerosis and impaired bone health in primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS).
17582,1850,"METHODS: 64 consecutive patients with primary SS, 77 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 60 healthy controls (HC) f similar age and sex distribution were enrolled."
17583,1850,"Demographics, clinical/laboratory features, classical risk factors for atherosclerosis and osteoporosis (OP) were recorded."
17584,1850,"Intima-medial thickness scores (IMT) and carotid/femoral (C/F) plaque formation, as well as bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures were evaluated."
17585,1850,Determinants of IMT/BMD levels and the presence of plaque were assessed by univariate and multivariate models.
17586,1850,Serum levels of the Wnt signaling mediators Dickkopf-related protein 1(DKK1) and sclerostin were determined in primary SS patients and HC.
17587,1850,"RESULTS: Increased arterial wall thickening (IMT>0.90mm) and impaired bone health (defined as OP or osteopenia), were detected in approximately two-thirds of primary SS and RA patients, with a mean IMT value being significantly increased compared to HC."
17588,1850,"The presence of primary SS emerged as an independent risk factor for arterial wall thickening when traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) including age, sex, hypertension, smoking (pack/years), LDL and HDL levels were taken into account in a multivariate model [adjusted OR 95% (CI): 2.8 (1.04-7.54)]."
17589,1850,"In primary SS, age was revealed as independent predictor of increased IMT scores; age and lymphopenia as well as increased urine pH as independent determinants of C/F plaque formation and OP/osteopenia, respectively."
17590,1850,"An independent association of OP/osteopenia with plaque formation was observed when independent predictors for both variables were considered, with low DKK1 levels being associated with both plaque formation and lower BMD levels."
17591,1850,"CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities such as subclinical atherosclerosis and impaired bone health occur frequently in primary SS, in association with disease related features and traditional risk factors."
17592,1850,Wnt signaling mediators are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of both entities.
17593,1851,"Sjgren's syndrome (SjS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are common systemic autoimmune diseases, which impact not only patient health but also their quality of life."
17594,1851,miRNA-146a is a microRNA that participates in the pathophysiology of SjS and SLE.
17595,1851,"In this investigation, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the relationship of miR-146a to primary SjS (PSS) and to SLE."
17596,1851,"The following databases were interrogated; Pubmed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, WANFANG, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WEIPU."
17597,1851,Standard mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to study the relationship between miRNA-146a expression and thee diseases by random-effects model.
17598,1851,"A total of six studies, with 158 cases and 124 controls were included for the meta-analysis."
17599,1851,"The meta-analysis shows that miRNA-146a expression is associated with the risk of PSS (MD=6.32, p=0.005)."
17600,1851,"No relationship between miR-146a expression and SLE was identified (MD=-0.86, p=0.26)."
17601,1851,SLE subgroup analysis (peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum) confirmed this result.
17602,1851,"The risk for PSS is related to miR-146a expression, while miRNA-146a expression is not related to SLE."
17603,1851,"As such, miRNA-146a may serve as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of PSS, but not SLE."
17604,1852,Recurrent parotitis is a rare manifestation of Sjgren syndrome.
17605,1852,The management of recurrent parotitis is challenging because conservative methods may be of limited efficacy and invasive approaches carry the risk of complications.
17606,1852,"Botulinum toxin has been shown to reduce salivary flow, and consequently, the results of its use in the management of recurrent parotitis have been encouraging."
17607,1852,"A 65-year-old female patient with recurrent parotitis due to Sjgren syndrome was referred to us, complaining of weekly bouts of inflammation."
17608,1852,She required a course of antibiotics monthly to control bacterial superinfections.
17609,1852,We treated her with onabotulinumtoxinA injections into both parotid glands at regular intervals.
17610,1852,"After her second injection cycle, she denied further inflammatory bouts, has not required antibiotics in more than 36months, and denied any side effects."
17611,1852,Botulinum toxin may be a safe and effective method of treating Sjgren syndrome-associated recurrent parotitis.
17612,1853,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic utilities of anti-agalactosyl IgG antibody (CARF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody and rheumatoid factor (RF) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), non-RA rheumatic diseases, and chronic viral hepatitis."
17613,1853,"The authors determined serum levels of CARF and anti-CCP2 by ELISA and IgM-RF by a immunonephelometric method in 834 controls and in 397 patients with the following conditions: RA (100), non-RA rheumatic diseases [systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 30, primary Sjogren's syndrome 18, systemic sclerosis 30, inflammatory myositis 19], chronic viral hepatitis B and C (HBV 100, HCV 100)."
17614,1853,"The sensitivities of CARF (83%) and anti-CCP (85%) were significantly higher than that of RF (75%, p=0.01, respectively) in RA, and the specificity of anti-CCP (98%) was significantly higher than those of CARF (92%) and RF (90%, p<0.001, respectively)."
17615,1853,"A comparison of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves revealed that the diagnostic accuracies of CARF and anti-CCP were superior to that of RF (CARF vs. RF, p=0.008, anti-CCP vs. RF, p=0.017) in RA."
17616,1853,"CARF positivity was significantly higher than those of anti-CCP (p=0.007) and RF (p=0.008) in systemic sclerosis, and the positivity of CARF was significantly higher than that of anti-CCP in Sjogren's syndrome (p=0.016)."
17617,1853,"Furthermore, CARF had significantly higher positivity than anti-CCP or RF in chronic viral hepatitis B and C. Finally, the titers of these three markers in RA were significantly higher than in non-RA rheumatic diseases and in chronic viral hepatitis B and C. Our results suggest that anti-CCP is the most useful serologic marker for the differentiation of RA and non-RA rheumatic diseases, and chronic viral hepatitis B and C."
17618,1854,Thymoma is the most common neoplasm of the anterior mediastinum but thymoma with Sjgren syndrome (SS) is rare.
17619,1854,Sjgren syndrome is a systemic autoimmune inflammatory disorder.
17620,1854,"It is characterized by lymphocyte-mediated destruction of exocrine glands, which leads to absent glandular secretion."
17621,1854,"Here, we present the case of a 63-year-old man with thymoma and concurrent myasthenia gravis and SS, who achieved remission after thymectomy."
17622,1855,BACKGROUND: Iguratimod is a novel anti-rheumatic drug with the capability of anti-cytokines as report goes.
17623,1855,It has been reported that iguratimod is effective and safe for rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatisms.
17624,1855,"As side effects, iguratimod can cause gastrointestinal reactions, dizziness, headache and itchy."
17625,1855,"CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report, a 60-year-old female patient was admitted with suspected drug-induced liver injury (DILI) caused by iguratimod."
17626,1855,"The causality assessment was done by the updated RUCAM, and the possibility of the case in our paper diagnosed as highly probable for the score was 9 points."
17627,1855,"Iguratimod was discontinued immediately, and methylprednisolone was used for acute liver injury and Sjogren's syndrome."
17628,1855,"The data showed the patient has improved gradually, and she was discharged on day 27."
17629,1855,The true incidence of iguratimod-related hepatotoxicity and its pathogenic mechanism are largely unknown.
17630,1855,"It is difficult to recognize and diagnose DILI, and there is no standard for diagnosis of DILI."
17631,1855,"At the same time, the DILI is still lack of specific treatment."
17632,1855,"CONCLUSIONS: Based on this rare case of severe liver injury, we recommend careful monitoring of liver function throughout iguratimod treatment for diseases."
17633,1856,Extranodal marginal zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) are associated with various infectious pathogens.
17634,1856,"We analyzed the presence of Chlamydia psittaci, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Chlamydia trachomatis DNA in 47 nongastrointestinal and 14 gastrointestinal MALT lymphomas, 37 nonmalignant control samples, and 27 autoimmune precursor lesions by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing."
17635,1856,"In 47 nongastrointestinal MALT lymphomas, 13 (28%) were positive for C psittaci DNA compared with 4 (11%) of 37 nonmalignant control samples (P = .09)."
17636,1856,"C psittaci was detected at variable frequencies in MALT lymphomas of different sites: lung, 100% (5/5; P < .01); thyroid gland, 30% (3/10; P > .05); salivary gland, 13% (2/15; P > .05); ocular adnexa, 15% (2/13); and skin, 25% (1/4)."
17637,1856,"Of 27 autoimmune precursor lesions (11 Hashimoto thyroiditis and 16 Sjgren syndrome), 11 (41%) contained C psittaci DNA."
17638,1856,Only 1 (7%) of 14 gastrointestinal MALT lymphomas was positive for C psittaci.
17639,1856,All specimens were negative for C trachomatis and C pneumoniae.
17640,1856,"Besides ocular adnexal lymphomas, C psittaci infection is associated with nongastrointestinal MALT lymphomas and autoimmune precursor lesions, suggesting possible involvement of C psittaci-induced antigenic-driven MALT lymphomagenesis."
17641,1857,OBJECTIVES: Vaccination of patients with rheumatic disease has been reported to result in lower antibody titres than in healthy individuals.
17642,1857,"However, studies primarily include patients on immunosuppressive therapy."
17643,1857,"Here, we investigated the immune response of treatment-nave patients diagnosed with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) to an H1N1 influenza vaccine."
17644,1857,METHODS: Patients with Sjgren's syndrome without immunomodulatory treatment and age-matched and gender-matched healthy controls were immunised with an H1N1 influenza vaccine and monitored for serological and cellular immune responses.
17645,1857,Clinical symptoms were monitored with a standardised form.
17646,1857,IgG class switch and plasma cell differentiation were induced in vitro in purified nave B cells of untreated and hydroxychloroquine-treated patients and healthy controls.
17647,1857,Gene expression was assessed by NanoString technology.
17648,1857,"RESULTS: Surprisingly, treatment-nave patients with Sjgren's syndrome developed higher H1N1 IgG titres of greater avidity than healthy controls on vaccination."
17649,1857,"Notably, off-target B cells were also triggered resulting in increased anti-EBV and autoantibody titres."
17650,1857,Endosomal toll-like receptor activation of nave B cells in vitro revealed a greater propensity of patient-derived cells to differentiate into plasmablasts and higher production of class switched IgG.
17651,1857,"The amplified plasma cell differentiation and class switch could be induced in cells from healthy donors by preincubation with type 1 interferon, but was abolished in hydroxychloroquine-treated patients and after in vitro exposure of nave B cells to chloroquine."
17652,1857,"CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive analysis of the immune response in autoimmune patients to exogenous stimulation identifies a mechanistic basis for the B cell hyperactivity in Sjgren's syndrome, and suggests that caution is warranted when considering vaccination in non-treated autoimmune patients."
17653,1858,"BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterised by aberrant B cell hyperactivation, whose mechanism is partially understood."
17654,1858,METHODS: We performed whole transcriptome sequencing of B cells from three pSS patients and three matched healthy controls (HC).
17655,1858,Differentially expression genes (DEGs) were confirmed with B cells from 40 pSS patients and 40 HC by quantitative PCR and western blot.
17656,1858,We measured the proliferation potential and immunoglobulins production of siRNA-transfected or plasmid-transfected B cells stimulated with cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) or anti-IgM.
17657,1858,We also explored Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signalling to reveal the potential mechanism of B cell hyperactivation in pSS.
17658,1858,RESULTS: We identified 77 upregulated and 32 downregulated DEGs in pSS B cells.
17659,1858,We confirmed that epithelial stromal interaction (EPST1) expression in pSS B cells was significantly higher than that from HCs.
17660,1858,EPSTI1-silencing B cells stimulated with CpG were less proliferated and produced lower level of IgG and IgM comparing with control B cells.
17661,1858,"EPSTI1-silencing B cells expressed lower level of p-p65 and higher level of IB, and B cells with overexpressed EPSTI1 showed higher level of p-p65 and lower level of IB."
17662,1858,"Finally, IB degradation inhibitor Dehydrocostus Lactone treatment attenuated p65 phosphorylation promoted by EPSTI1."
17663,1858,"CONCLUSION: Elevated EPSTI1 expression in pSS B cells promoted TLR9 signalling activation and contributed to the abnormal B cell activation, which was promoted by facilitating p65 phosphorylation and activation of NF-B signalling via promoting IB degradation."
17664,1858,EPSTI1 might be implicated in pSS pathogenesis and was a potential therapeutic target of pSS.
17665,1859,PURPOSE: To identify a screening strategy for dry eye patients with a high likelihood of having Sjogren syndrome (SS) through the evaluation of the association of ocular surface tests with the extraocular signs used for the diagnosis of SS.
17666,1859,DESIGN: Multicenter cross-sectional study.
17667,1859,METHODS: The Sjogren's International Clinical Collaborative Alliance (SICCA) registry enrolled 3514 participants with SS or possible SS from 9 international academic sites.
17668,1859,"Ocular surface evaluation included Schirmer I testing, tear breakup time (TBUT), and staining of the cornea (0-6 points) and conjunctiva (0-6 points)."
17669,1859,Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors for (1) histopathologic changes on labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsies (positive= focus score of 1 focus/4mm(2)) and (2) positive anti-SSA/B serology.
17670,1859,"RESULTS: The adjusted odds of having a positive LSG biopsy were significantly higher among those with an abnormal Schirmer I test (adjusted OR= 1.26, 95% CI 1.05-1.51, P= .014) and positive conjunctival staining(for each additional unit of staining 1.46; 95% CI 1.39-1.53, P < .001) or corneal staining (for each additional unit of staining 1.14; 95% CI 1.08-1.21, P< .001)."
17671,1859,"The odds of having a positive serology were significantly higher among those with an abnormal Schirmer I test (adjusted OR= 1.3; 95% CI 1.09-1.54, P= .004) and conjunctival staining (adjusted OR=1.51; 95% CI 1.43-1.58, P < .001)."
17672,1859,"CONCLUSIONS: In addition to corneal staining, which was associated with a higher likelihood of having a positive LSG biopsy, conjunctival staining and abnormal Schirmer I testing are of critical importance to include when screening dry eye patients for possible SS, as they were associated with a higher likelihood of having a positive LSG biopsy and serology."
17673,1860,BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to characterize the risk of cancer in a large cohort of patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (SjS).
17674,1860,METHODS: We had analyzed the development of cancer in 1300 consecutive patients fulfilling the 2002 SjS classification criteria.
17675,1860,The baseline clinical and immunological characteristics and systemic activity (ESSDAI scores) were assessed at diagnosis as predictors of cancer using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for age at diagnosis and gender.
17676,1860,The sex-and age-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIR) of cancer were estimated from 2012 Spanish mortality data.
17677,1860,"RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 91months, 127 (9.8%) patients developed 133 cancers."
17678,1860,The most frequent type of cancer was B-cell lymphoma (including 27 MALT and 19 non-MALT B-cell lymphomas).
17679,1860,Systemic activity at diagnosis of primary SjS correlated with the risk of hematological neoplasia and cryoglobulins with a high risk of either B-cell or non-B-cell lymphoma subtypes.
17680,1860,"Patients with cytopenias had a high risk of non-MALT B-cell and non-B-cell cancer, while those with low C3 levels had a high risk of MALT lymphomas and those with monoclonal gammopathy and low C4 levels had a high risk of non-MALT lymphomas."
17681,1860,The estimated SIR for solid cancer was 1.13 and 11.02 for hematological cancer.
17682,1860,"SIRs for specific cancers were 36.17 for multiple myeloma and immunoproliferative diseases, 19.41 for Hodgkin lymphoma, 6.04 for other non-Hodgkin lymphomas, 5.17 for thyroid cancer, 4.81 for cancers of the lip and oral cavity, and 2.53 for stomach cancer."
17683,1860,CONCLUSIONS: One third of cancers developed by patients with primary SjS are B-cell lymphomas.
17684,1860,The prognostic factors identified at SjS diagnosis differed according to the subtype of B-cell lymphoma developed.
17685,1860,"Primary SjS is also associated with the development of some non-hematological cancers (thyroid, oral cavity, and stomach)."
17686,1861,We investigated the role of CD4(+) T-cell-produced interferon (IFN)- on corneal epithelial apoptosis in a murine desiccating stress (DS) model that resembles Sjgren's syndrome.
17687,1861,The DS model was generated in C57BL/6 (B6) and B6 IFN--knockout (B6KO) mice.
17688,1861,Adoptive transfer of CD4(+) T cells from DS-exposed donor to recombination activating gene (RAG)-1(-/-) recipient mice and topical neutralization of IFN- were performed to determine whether IFN- produced by pathogenic CD4(+) T cells promotes corneal epithelial apoptosis.
17689,1861,"Apoptosis in corneal epithelia was assessed by evaluating the expression and activity of caspases 3, 8, and 9."
17690,1861,"The activation of caspase-8 mediated increased corneal epithelial apoptosis in B6 mice after DS, and this was exacerbated by subconjunctival IFN- injection."
17691,1861,"B6KO mice were resistant to DS-induced apoptosis; however, B6KO mice receiving IFN- developed apoptosis similar to that observed in B6 wild-type mice."
17692,1861,"Adoptive transfer of CD4(+) T cells from donors subjected to DS increased corneal epithelial apoptosis via activation of caspase-8 in recipients, similar to that in the donor mice."
17693,1861,Topical neutralization of IFN- in adoptive transfer recipients decreased corneal epithelial apoptosis.
17694,1861,"DS, IFN- administration, or CD4(+) T-cell adoptive transfer had no effect on the expression and activation of the intrinsic apoptosis mediator, caspase-9."
17695,1861,CD4(+) T-cell-produced IFN- plays a pivotal role in DS-induced corneal epithelial apoptosis via activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
17696,1862,"OBJECTIVE: Central and peripheral B cell tolerance checkpoints are defective in many patients with autoimmune diseases, but the functionality of each discrete checkpoint has not been assessed in patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS)."
17697,1862,We undertook this study to assess this functionality in SS patients.
17698,1862,"METHODS: Using a polymerase chain reaction-based approach that allows us to clone and express, invitro, recombinant antibodies produced by single B cells, we tested the reactivity of recombinant antibodies cloned from single CD19+CD21(low) CD10+IgM(high) CD27- newly emigrant/transitional B cells and CD19+CD21+CD10-IgM+CD27- mature naive B cells from 5 SS patients."
17699,1862,"RESULTS: We found that the frequencies of newly emigrant/transitional B cells expressing polyreactive antibodies were significantly increased in SS patients compared to those in healthy donors, revealing defective central B cell tolerance in SS patients."
17700,1862,"Frequencies of mature naive B cells expressing autoreactive antibodies were also significantly increased in SS patients, thereby illustrating an impaired peripheral B cell tolerance checkpoint in these patients."
17701,1862,CONCLUSION: Defective counterselection of developing autoreactive B cells observed in SS patients is a feature common to many other autoimmune diseases and may favor the development of autoimmunity by allowing autoreactive B cells to present self antigens to T cells.
17702,1863,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical, interferon and imaging predictors of progression from 'At Risk' to autoimmune connective tissue diseases (AI-CTDs)."
17703,1863,METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in At-Risk of AI-CTD (defined as antinuclear antibody (ANA) positive; 1clinical systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) criterion; symptom duration <12 months and treatment-nave).
17704,1863,Bloods and skin biopsy (non-lesional) were analysed for two interferon-stimulated gene expression scores previously described (IFN-Score-A and IFN-Score-B).
17705,1863,Forty-nine healthy controls (HCs) and 114 SLE were used as negative and positive controls.
17706,1863,Musculoskeletal ultrasound was performed.
17707,1863,Progression was defined by meeting classification criteria for AI-CTDs at 12 months.
17708,1863,RESULTS: 118 individuals with 12-month follow-up were included.
17709,1863,"Of these, 19/118 (16%) progressed to AI-CTD (SLE=14, primary Sjogren's=5)."
17710,1863,"At baseline, both IFN scores differed among At-Risk, HCs and SLE groups (p<0.001) and both were elevated in At-Risk who progressed to AI-CTD at 12 months versus non-progressors, to a greater extent for IFN-Score-B (fold difference (95%CI) 3.22 (1.74 to 5.95), p<0.001) than IFN-Score-A (2.94 (1.14 to 7.54); p=0.018)."
17711,1863,Progressors did not have significantly greater baseline clinical characteristics or ultrasound findings.
17712,1863,Fold difference between At-Risk and HCs for IFN-Score-A was markedly greater in skin than blood.
17713,1863,"In multivariable logistic regression, only family history of autoimmune rheumatic disease, OR 8.2 (95% CI 1.58 to 42.53) and IFN-Score-B, 3.79 (1.50-9.58) increased the odds of progression."
17714,1863,CONCLUSION: A two-factor interferon score and family history predict progression from ANA positivity to AI-CTD.
17715,1863,These interferon scores may allow stratification of individuals At-Risk of AI-CTD permitting early intervention for disease prevention and avoid irreversible organ damage.
17716,1864,"Heath care providers should be comfortable with normal as well as pathologic findings in the lips, because the lips are highly visible and may display clinical manifestations of local, as well as systemic inflammatory, allergic, irritant, and neoplastic alterations."
17717,1864,"Fortunately, the lips are easily accessible."
17718,1864,"The evaluation should include a careful history and physical examination, including visual inspection, as well as palpation of the lips and an examination of associated cervical, submandibular, and submental nodes."
17719,1864,"Pathologic and microscopic studies, as well as a review of medications, allergies, and habits, may further highlight possible etiologies."
17720,1864,"Many lip conditions, including premalignant changes, are relatively easy to treat, when the abnormalities are detected early; however, advanced disease and malignancies are challenging for both the patient and clinician."
17721,1864,Treatment should be focused on eliminating potential irritants or allergens and treatment of the primary dermatosis.
17722,1864,In this paper we review physiologic variants as well as pathologic conditions of the lips.
17723,1865,BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren syndrome (PSS) is a systemic autoimmune condition with an estimated prevalence of 0.6%.
17724,1865,The frequency of neurologic manifestations in PSS varies widely from 0% to 60%.
17725,1865,METHODS: We report the characteristics of PSS patients with neurologic involvement seen at a single tertiary hospital in Singapore.
17726,1865,"Eight consecutive women (median age, 51 years [range, 38-67 years]) with neurologic manifestations of PSS seen between March 2009 to June 2011 were followed up for a mean duration of 19 months from the onset of neurologic manifestations."
17727,1865,RESULTS: Six of 8 patients with neurosjgren had their neurologic manifestation at time of PSS diagnosis.
17728,1865,"The lag times of neurologic manifestations from PSS diagnosis for the remaining 2 patients were 9 and 30 years, respectively."
17729,1865,Sicca symptoms were not readily volunteered as a presenting complaint in the majority of patients.
17730,1865,All our patients received early aggressive therapy with pulse corticosteroids and intravenously administered cyclophosphamide.
17731,1865,The mean duration from initial presentation to initiation of treatment was 11 days (1-26 days).
17732,1865,"All achieved good recovery regardless of the type or site of neurologic involvement, initial erythrocyte sedimentation rate, immunoglobulin and complement levels."
17733,1865,"CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic disease, when present, is a strong contributor to disease activity and damage."
17734,1865,Confirmatory tests should be conducted early regardless of the presence of sicca symptoms.
17735,1865,"Vigilance for the development of new neurologic symptoms is imperative even in chronic, apparently stable patients."
17736,1865,It is likely that early initiation of treatment contributed to good recovery in our patients.
17737,1866,AIM: To evaluate in vivo changes after therapy using autologous serum (AS) eye drops in Sjgren's syndrome (SS)-related dry eyes by confocal microscopy.
17738,1866,"PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 24 patients with SS-related dry eyes [12 in AS eye drop therapy and 12 in artificial tear (AT) therapy] and 24 healthy volunteers were recruited."
17739,1866,"Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), central corneal thickness, tear film, break-up time, corneal and conjunctival staining, Schirmer's test and corneal confocal microscopy were investigated."
17740,1866,"RESULTS: Tear production, tear stability, corneal staining, inflammation, and central corneal thickness, Langherans cells, activated keratocytes, intermediate epithelial cell density, nerve tortuosity, number of sub-basal nerve branches, and number of bead-like formations differed between patients and controls (p<0.0001)."
17741,1866,"The AT and AS groups differed in the OSDI, number of branches, and number of beadings (p<0.0001)."
17742,1866,CONCLUSION: AS eye drops improve symptoms and confocal microscopy findings in SS-related dry eyes.
17743,1867,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that causes secretory dysfunction of the salivary glands.
17744,1867,It has been reported that proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) was elevated and tight junction (TJ) integrity disrupted in minor salivary glands from SS patients.
17745,1867,"However, whether the elevated IL-17 in SS affects TJ integrity and thereby alters the function of salivary gland is unknown."
17746,1867,"Here, by using nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice as SS model, we found that the stimulated salivary flow rate was significantly decreased in NOD mice."
17747,1867,"Lymphocyte infiltration was mainly observed in submandibular glands (SMGs), but not parotid glands (PGs), of NOD mice."
17748,1867,IL-17 was significantly increased and mainly located in lymphocytic-infiltrating regions in SMGs but not detectable in PGs of NOD mice.
17749,1867,"Meanwhile, the epithelial barrier function was disrupted, as evidenced by an increased paracellular tracer clearance and an enlarged acinar TJ width in SMGs of NOD mice."
17750,1867,"Furthermore, claudin-1 and -3 were elevated especially at the basolateral membranes, whereas claudin-4, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were reduced in SMGs of NOD mice."
17751,1867,"Moreover, occludin and ZO-1 were dispersed into cytoplasm in SMGs of NOD mice."
17752,1867,"However, no change in the expression and distribution of TJ proteins was found in PGs."
17753,1867,"In vitro, IL-17 significantly decreased the levels and apical staining of claudin-4 and ZO-1 proteins in the cultured SMG tissues, as well as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 in PG tissues."
17754,1867,"Moreover, IL-17 activated the phosphorylation of IB and p65 in SMG cells, whereas pretreatment with NF-B inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate suppressed the IL-17-induced downregulation of claudin-4 and ZO-1 in SMG tissues."
17755,1867,"Taken together, these findings indicate that IL-17 derived from infiltrating lymphocyte impairs the integrity of TJ barrier through NF-B signaling pathway, and thus might contribute to salivary gland dysfunction in SS."
17756,1868,"The blood CD4(+) CXCR5(+) T cells, known as ""circulating"" Tfh, have been shown to efficiently induce nave B cells to produce immunoglobulin."
17757,1868,They play an important role in certain autoimmune diseases.
17758,1868,"In the present study, we show for the first time that the frequency of CD4(+) CXCR5(+) T cells is increased in pSS patients and positively correlated with autoantibodies in the blood."
17759,1868,The concentration of Th17-like subsets (CD4(+) CXCR5(+) CCR6(+)) in pSS patients was found to be significantly higher than in healthy controls.
17760,1868,"Functional assays showed that activated Th17-like subtypes in the blood display the key features of Tfh cells, including invariably coexpressed PD-1, ICOS, CD40L and IL-21."
17761,1868,Th17 subsets were found to highly express Bcl-6 protein and Th1 and Th2 were not.
17762,1868,Bcl-6 is believed to be a master transforming factor for Tfh cell differentiation and facilitate B cell proliferation and somatic hypermutation within the germinal center.
17763,1868,These data indicate that Th17 subsets of CD4(+) CXCR5(+) T cells in the blood may participate in the antibody-related immune responses and that high frequency of CD4(+) CXCR5(+) CCR6(+) Tfh cells in blood may be suitable biomarkers for the evaluation of the active immune stage of pSS patients.
17764,1868,It might provide insights into the pathogenesis and perhaps help researchers identify novel therapeutic targets for pSS.
17765,1869,OBJECTIVE: To score systemic activity at diagnosis and correlate baseline activity with survival in a large cohort of patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (SS).
17766,1869,PATIENTS AND METHODS: We include 1045 consecutive patients who fulfilled the 2002 classification criteria for primary SS.
17767,1869,The clinical and immunological characteristics and level of activity (EULAR-SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) scores) were assessed at diagnosis as predictors of death using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for age at diagnosis.
17768,1869,The risk of death was calculated at diagnosis according to four different predictive models.
17769,1869,"RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 117months, 115 (11%) patients died."
17770,1869,"The adjusted standardised mortality ratio for the total cohort was 4.66 (95% CI 3.85 to 5.60), and survival rates at 5, 10, 20 and 30years were 96%, 90%, 81% and 60%, respectively."
17771,1869,"The main baseline factors associated with overall mortality in the multivariate analysis were male gender, cryoglobulins and low C4 levels."
17772,1869,"Baseline activity in the constitutional, pulmonary and biological domains was associated with a higher risk of death."
17773,1869,"High activity in at least one ESSDAI domain (HR 2.14), a baseline ESSDAI score 14 (HR 1.85) and more than one laboratory predictive marker (lymphopenia, anti-La, monoclonal gammopathy, low C3, low C4 and/or cryoglobulins) (HR 2.82) were associated with overall mortality; these HRs increased threefold to 10-fold when the analysis was restricted to mortality associated with systemic disease."
17774,1869,"CONCLUSIONS: Patients with primary SS, who present at diagnosis with high systemic activity (ESSDAI 14) and/or predictive immunological markers (especially those with more than one), are at higher risk of death."
17775,1870,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of the multi-glycosides of Tripterygium wilfordii (GTW) on Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model.
17776,1870,"METHODS: Twenty-seven 8-week-old, female NOD mice were divided into the GTW group, the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) group, and control (normal saline) group, and received corresponding treatment for 16 weeks."
17777,1870,"The treatment-induced changes in stimulated total saliva flow rate (STFR), level of serum anti-SSA/SSB, ratio of regulatory T (Treg) cells, histology of the submandibular gland (SMG) and the gene expression profile that is related to inflammation and autoimmunization were evaluated."
17778,1870,"RESULTS: Compared to the untreated (control) mice, STRF, SMG index and Treg/CD4+ cell ratio were significantly higher, whereas anti-SSA, anti-SSB and lymphoid foci were remarkably lower in GTW-treated mice."
17779,1870,HCQ-treated mice showed similar results except SMG index was not different from the untreated mice.
17780,1870,NOD mice showed 19.03% altered gene expression with maturation from the age of 8 weeks to 24 weeks.
17781,1870,"Treatment with HCQ and GTW reduced the change in gene expression to 13.09% and 7.14%, respectively."
17782,1870,CONCLUSION: GTW is as effective as HCQ in the treatment of Sjgren's syndrome in the NOD mouse model.
17783,1871,"BACKGROUND: Multiple autoimmune syndrome (MAS), an extreme phenotype of autoimmune disorders, is a very well suited trait to tackle genomic variants of these conditions."
17784,1871,Whole exome sequencing (WES) is a widely used strategy for detection of protein coding and splicing variants associated with inherited diseases.
17785,1871,"METHODS: The DNA of eight patients affected by MAS [all of whom presenting with Sjgren's syndrome (SS)], four patients affected by SS alone and 38 unaffected individuals, were subject to WES."
17786,1871,Filters to identify novel and rare functional (pathogenic-deleterious) homozygous and/or compound heterozygous variants in these patients and controls were applied.
17787,1871,Bioinformatics tools such as the Human gene connectome as well as pathway and network analysis were applied to test overrepresentation of genes harbouring these variants in critical pathways and networks involved in autoimmunity.
17788,1871,"RESULTS: Eleven novel and rare functional variants were identified in cases but not in controls, harboured in: MACF1, KIAA0754, DUSP12, ICA1, CELA1, LRP1/STAT6, GRIN3B, ANKLE1, TMEM161A, and FKRP."
17789,1871,These were subsequently subject to network analysis and their functional relatedness to genes already associated with autoimmunity was evaluated.
17790,1871,"Notably, the LRP1/STAT6 novel mutation was homozygous in one MAS affected patient and heterozygous in another."
17791,1871,LRP1/STAT6 disclosed the strongest plausibility for autoimmunity.
17792,1871,LRP1/STAT6 are involved in extracellular and intracellular anti-inflammatory pathways that play key roles in maintaining the homeostasis of the immune system.
17793,1871,"Further; networks, pathways, and interaction analyses showed that LRP1 is functionally related to the HLA-B and IL10 genes and it has a substantial impact within immunological pathways and/or reaction to bacterial and other foreign proteins (phagocytosis, regulation of phospholipase A2 activity, negative regulation of apoptosis and response to lipopolysaccharides)."
17794,1871,"Further, ICA1 and STAT6 were also closely related to AIRE and IRF5, two very well known autoimmunity genes."
17795,1871,CONCLUSIONS: Novel and rare exonic mutations that may account for autoimmunity were identified.
17796,1871,"Among those, the LRP1/STAT6 novel mutation has the strongest case for being categorised as potentially causative of MAS given the presence of intriguing patterns of functional interaction with other major genes shaping autoimmunity."
17797,1872,"We report two cases of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) which developed after interferon (IFN) therapy for chronic hepatitis C. The patients had experienced abrupt hyperglycemia with positive anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, resulting in initiation of insulin therapy."
17798,1872,"In one case, insulin therapy could be discontinued because endogenous insulin secretion was preserved at the onset and pancreatic beta cell function was recovered thereafter."
17799,1872,"In the other case with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Sjgren's syndrome, continuation of insulin therapy was necessary because blood glucose levels were unstably controlled."
17800,1872,Lasting autoimmunity superior to immunosuppressive mechanism may be associated with distinct clinical courses in these cases.
17801,1873,"BACKGROUND: Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis is a fibroinflammatory disease of the salivary glands, characteristically of the submandibular gland."
17802,1873,One prior Asian study proposed that chronic sclerosing sialadenitis is a part of the spectrum of IgG4-associated disease.
17803,1873,This association has not been confirmed in Western populations.
17804,1873,"We therefore, investigated the relationship between IgG4 and chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, and compared the histomorphologic features of this condition with those of chronic sialadenitis-not otherwise specified, Sjgren syndrome, and lymphoepithelial sialadenitis."
17805,1873,"MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 13 cases of chronic sclerosing sialadenitis and compared them with 15 cases of chronic sialadenitis-not otherwise specified, 8 lip biopsies from individuals with Sjgren syndrome, and 4 cases of lymphoepithelial sialadenitis."
17806,1873,"Immunohistochemistry for IgG, and IgG4 was carried out."
17807,1873,IgG4-positive plasma cells were quantified and the IgG4/IgG ratio was calculated.
17808,1873,RESULTS: Seven patients with chronic sclerosing sialadenitis were female and 6 were male.
17809,1873,Their mean age was 61 years (range: 27 to 80).
17810,1873,Twelve chronic sclerosing sialadenitis cases involved the submandibular gland (bilaterally in 3) and in 1 there was a parotid lesion.
17811,1873,Three of these 12 cases had manifestations of IgG4-associated systemic disease.
17812,1873,"Morphologically these specimens had preservation of lobular architecture, hypercellular interlobular fibrosis, florid lymphoid hyperplasia, and numerous plasma cells."
17813,1873,Obliterative phlebitis was observed in 6 cases.
17814,1873,"The histologic features of chronic sclerosing sialadenitis were reminiscent of autoimmune pancreatitis, and were either not observed or were present only focally in cases of chronic sialadenitis, Sjgren syndrome, and lymphoepithelial sialadenitis.Eleven of 12 evaluable cases showed an increased number of IgG4 plasma cells with a mean of 229/high-power field (HPF) (range 75 to 608) and an overall IgG4/IgG ratio of 0.86 (range 0.5 to 1)."
17815,1873,The only patient whose biopsy lacked IgG4-positive plasma cells had pathologic evidence of cytomegalovirus infection.
17816,1873,"Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis cases, in comparison with the other 3 groups studied, showed a significantly higher number of IgG4 positive plasma cells (P<0.05)."
17817,1873,"Patients with chronic sialadenitis-not otherwise specified had a median number of only 16 IgG4-positive plasma cells/HPF (range 2 to 44), with an IgG4/IgG ratio of 0.14 (range 0.02 to 0.28)."
17818,1873,"The Sjgren syndrome patients had a median of 1 IgG4-positive plasma cell/HPF (range 0 to 3), with an IgG4/IgG ratio of 0.02 (range 0 to 0.07)."
17819,1873,Patients with lymphoepithelial sialadenitis had a median of 0 IgG4-positive plasma cells per HPF.
17820,1873,CONCLUSION: Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis has a characteristic morphologic appearance.
17821,1873,"This morphologic appearance, in conjunction with the elevated IgG4 expression, distinguishes chronic sclerosing sialadenitis from other inflammatory diseases of the salivary glands."
17822,1873,Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis belongs to the spectrum of IgG4-related diseases.
17823,1874,"In a case involving a patient with scleroderma, the authors demonstrate how to treatment plan and sequence the transition from a failing restored dentition to complete implant-supported fixed prostheses with sequential extractions and implant placements."
17824,1874,The article also presents surgical and prosthodontic considerations for a complete-mouth implant-supported fixed rehabilitation while achieving optimal esthetics without compromising function in patients with this condition.
17825,1874,"Sequential treatment provided the patient with fixed provisional restorations during treatment in multiple, short surgical appointments with less psychosocial trauma."
17826,1874,"This case posed treatment challenges due to limited oral access, unpredictable disease progression, and limited data on the success of treatment with endosseous dental implants in these patients."
17827,1875,OBJECTIVE: Corneal and ocular wavefront aberrations were recorded together with clinical examination results and patient-reported vision-related quality-of-life evaluation results to define the relevance of dynamic optical analysis of the eye in dry eye disease (DED).
17828,1875,DESIGN: Prospective and comparative clinical study.
17829,1875,PARTICIPANTS: Forty DED patients and 40 age- and gender-matched control subjects.
17830,1875,"METHODS: Serial measurements of ocular and corneal higher-order aberrations (HOAs) after blink were performed for 10 seconds using the KR-1 aberrometer (Topcon, Clichy, France)."
17831,1875,Vision-related health-targeted quality of life was evaluated using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire.
17832,1875,"The clinical examination included tear film assessment (tear film break-up time and Schirmer I test), ocular surface damage assessment with the Oxford and van Bijsterveld indexes, and Meibomian dysfunction grading."
17833,1875,Tear osmolarity also was measured.
17834,1875,MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The time course of HOAs and modulation transfer function (MTF) was compared between groups and was analyzed in comparison with the OSDI and clinical data in DED patients.
17835,1875,"RESULTS: The root mean square of ocular and corneal total HOAs, particularly third-order aberrations, significantly increased over the 10-second period in DED patients, whereas no change occurred in controls."
17836,1875,Analysis of MTF revealed progressive degradation of ocular optical quality resulting from loss of contrast at intermediate and high spatial frequencies in DED patients compared with controls.
17837,1875,The progression index for corneal HOAs was correlated with the subjective index of patient-reported visual outcomes and with objective clinical findings of tear film and ocular surface damage.
17838,1875,CONCLUSIONS: Objective measurement of the time course of HOAs may constitute a new single instrument to evaluate and manage patients with DED because it reliably reflects the completeness of the disease.
17839,1876,PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous serum (AS) eye drops combined with punctal plugs (PPs) in patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS)-related dry eye.
17840,1876,METHODS: A retrospective clinical study was performed in patients with dry eye caused by SS.
17841,1876,"We evaluated the Schirmer test value, tear breakup time (tBUT), and fluorescein and Rose Bengal (RB) staining scores at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and >1 year after treatment."
17842,1876,"The dry eye indexes were also evaluated in 2 subgroups, which determined by the using of PPs, including the AS + PP group and AS only group."
17843,1876,RESULTS: A total of 56 eyes of 28 patients were investigated with a mean follow-up of 42.3  26.1 months.
17844,1876,"After the application of AS eye drops, the Schirmer test showed no significant changes."
17845,1876,"The tBUT (2.7  1.9 seconds) was significantly improved at each time point (3.9  3.1, 4.5  3.1, 3.7  2.5, and 5.1  4.0; P < 0.01), fluorescein staining (4.3  2.8) was significantly improved at each time point (2.2  2.2, 1.9  1.9, 1.8  1.6, and 1.8  1.8; P < 0.01), and RB (2.6  3.0) staining was significantly improved from 6-month treatment (1.5  1.9, 1.9  1.9, and 1.4  1.8; P < 0.05, 0.01, and 0.01, respectively)."
17846,1876,"When combined with PPs, the tBUT and RB staining scores were found to be significantly improved in the AS + PP group compared with those of the AS only group."
17847,1876,CONCLUSIONS: Long-term application of AS eye drops was found to be an effective and apparently safe treatment for SS dry eye.
17848,1876,"Furthermore, PPs in combination with AS eye drops were considered to have an additive effect on SS dry eye."
17849,1877,Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions characterized by different extents of epidermal necrosis and mucosal breakdown.
17850,1877,A limited number of studies have reported the long-term patterns of SJS and TEN complications in patient populations over long follow-up periods.
17851,1877,"The aim of this retrospective study was to collect data on long-term sequelae in patients admitted for SJS, SJS/TEN overlap, or TEN between 1998 and 2012."
17852,1877,"Among all 102 patients eligible for analysis, the 2 most common sequelae were cutaneous and ocular problems, both with incidences of 44.1%."
17853,1877,Visceral organ involvement was observed in 2 patients with irreversible deterioration of chronic kidney disease and in one patient with interstitial lung disease.
17854,1877,Autoimmune disease was present in 6 patients: Sjgren's syndrome or Sjgren-like syndrome in 5 patients and concomitant systemic lupus erythematosus and Hashimoto thyroiditis in one patient.
17855,1878,Hypophysitis is an inflammatory disorder of the pituitary gland and corticosteroids are usually recommended as the first-line treatment.
17856,1878,Hypophysitis related to primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) is uncommon.
17857,1878,We describe the unusual case of a patient with infundibuloneurohypophysitis associated with pSS successfully treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).We describe a case of a 60-year-old man with a medical history of pSS presented with central diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism.
17858,1878,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a thickening of the pituitary stalk and intense enhancement of the posterior pituitary, pituitary stalk, and hypothalamus."
17859,1878,We diagnosed infundibuloneurohypophysitis associated with pSS.
17860,1878,Hormonal replacement was started immediately and MMF was introduced without corticosteroids.
17861,1878,"After 9 months of treatment, MRI of the pituitary revealed a complete regression of the nodular thickening of the pituitary stalk, with normal enhancement and appearance of the pituitary."
17862,1878,"The pituitary axes had completely recovered, whereas the diabetes insipidus was partially restored."
17863,1878,Our findings suggest that MMF is an effective alternative to corticosteroids for the treatment of lymphocytic hypophysitis associated with an autoimmune disease.
17864,1878,"Furthermore, this report could contribute to extend the spectrum of the neurological and endocrinological manifestations of pSS."
17865,1879,"The association between sarcoidosis and autoimmune comorbidities has been reported, however, it has seldom been confirmed by a large nationwide study."
17866,1879,Our study aimed to clarify the association between sarcoidosis and autoimmune comorbidities in the Taiwanese.
17867,1879,A total of 1237 patients with sarcoidosis and 4948 age- and sex-matched control subjects were selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan from 1997 to 2010.
17868,1879,Multiple logistic regressions were performed to calculate the odds of comorbidities between the two groups.
17869,1879,The prevalence of sarcoidosis was 2.17/100000 individuals in Taiwan.
17870,1879,"Sarcoidosis patients tended to run a higher risk of autoimmune comorbidities than the control group (17.6% vs 9.4%, P<0.05)."
17871,1879,"Autoimmune thyroid disease (adjusted odd ratio [aOR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.64), Sjgren's syndrome (aOR, 11.6; 95% CI, 4.36-31.0) and ankylosing spondylitis (aOR, 3.80; 95% CI, 2.42-5.97) were significantly associated with sarcoidosis."
17872,1879,"The sex-stratified analyses were carried out to demonstrate a significant association of sarcoidosis with ankylosing spondylitis in both sexes, but with autoimmune thyroid disease in male patients and with Sjgren's syndrome female patients, respectively."
17873,1879,"Besides, the diagnosis of the autoimmune comorbidities strongly associated with sarcoidosis tended to be established after that of sarcoidosis."
17874,1879,"This study demonstrated that patients with sarcoidosis tended to have autoimmune thyroid disease, Sjgren's syndrome and ankylosing spondylitis, and the diagnosis of sarcoidosis usually preceded that of associated comorbidities."
17875,1879,Clinicians should be alert to autoimmune comorbidities in patients with sarcoidosis.
17876,1880,BACKGROUND: Type I interferon activation is a hallmark event in Sjgren's syndrome.
17877,1880,"L1 retroelements stimulate plasmacytoid dendritic cells, activating the type I interferons, and are regulated by various mechanisms, including the APOBEC3 deaminases."
17878,1880,"As L1s are potential trigger factors in autoimmunity, we aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical localization of L1 ORF2p and its inhibitor APOBEC3B protein in minor salivary glands of Sjgren's syndrome patients."
17879,1880,"METHODS: Twenty minor salivary gland-tissue samples from 20 Sjgren's syndrome patients, classified according to Tarpley's histological criteria, and 10 controls were evaluated for L1 ORF2p and APOBEC3B expression via immunohistochemistry."
17880,1880,RESULTS: L1 ORF2p was expressed in 17/20 SS patients and all controls.
17881,1880,"APOBEC3B expression was observed in 15/20 Sjgren's syndrome patients, 5/5 chronic sialadenitis, and 3/5 normal minor salivary glands."
17882,1880,Both antibodies stained the cytoplasm of the ductal epithelial cells.
17883,1880,Negative staining was observed in the acinar cells.
17884,1880,"L1 ORF2p-positive immunostaining was significantly lower in Tarpley IV Sjgren's syndrome patients than controls (P = .039), and APOBEC3B-positive staining was significantly lower in Tarpley I compared to Tarpley II Sjgren's syndrome patients (P = .008) and controls (P = .035)."
17885,1880,CONCLUSIONS: L1 ORF2p and APOBEC3B are expressed in the ductal epithelial cells of minor salivary glands that are among the key targets in Sjgren's syndrome.
17886,1880,L1 ORF2p expression may promote the L1 ability to act as an intrinsic antigen in Sjgren's syndrome.
17887,1880,The potential future use of L1 ORF2-reverse transcriptase inhibitors in autoimmunity supports further investigation of L1 epigenetic regulation by APOBEC3 enzymes.
17888,1881,"PURPOSE: To investigate the relation between visual function, clinical findings, and visual symptoms in Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and to compare the results with Sjgren syndrome (SS) patients and normal subjects."
17889,1881,DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparative study.
17890,1881,"METHODS: One hundred fifteen eyes of 59 consecutive patients with SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), 208 eyes of 104 healthy normal subjects, and 132 eyes of 66 SS patients were investigated in this multicenter study."
17891,1881,"All study subjects underwent tear function and ocular surface examinations, Landolt and functional visual acuity examinations, and the Japanese version of the NEI VFQ-25 (National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire)."
17892,1881,RESULTS: The mean ocular surface grading scores were significantly higher and the mean score of all 12 NEI VFQ subscales was significantly lower in the SJS patients compared to the SS patients and the normal subjects (P < .05).
17893,1881,The conventional and functional logarithm of minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuities in SJS patients with minimal corneal complications were significantly higher and the mean total composite NEI VFQ scores were lower compared to SS patients.
17894,1881,The conventional and functional logMAR visual acuities and the mean ocular surface grading scores in SJS with aqueous deficiency were significantly higher and the mean total composite NEI VFQ scores were lower compared to SS patients.
17895,1881,Strong correlations between best-corrected logMAR functional visual acuities and either ocular surface grading scores or the composite NEI VFQ-25 scores were observed.
17896,1881,CONCLUSIONS: The functional visual acuity examination reflects the severity of clinical ocular surface findings and vision-related quality of life more than the standard conventional visual acuity in SJS.
17897,1882,Cholestatic liver diseases are rare diseases that often lead to cirrhosis and its consequent complications.
17898,1882,"In addition to liver-related morbidity, patients with cholestatic liver diseases often suffer from autoimmune diseases that affect several organs and tissues."
17899,1882,The robust and efficient data collection and collaboration between hepatologists and rheumatologists have led to significant advancements in understanding the relationship between the cholestatic liver diseases and associated autoimmune diseases.
17900,1882,"In this paper, we discuss the cholestatic liver diseases (primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and immunoglobulin G4 associated cholangitis) and associated autoimmune diseases."
17901,1883,Interstitial lung disease occurs in up to 25% of patients with Sjgren's syndrome and 2% - 8 % of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
17902,1883,Corticosteroid therapy remains the main treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus.
17903,1883,"However, it can be associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders especially with prednisolone at a dose of more than 40 mg/day."
17904,1883,We present the case of a 51-year-old patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and secondary Sjgren's syndrome with severe pulmonary involvement four years after the diagnosis.
17905,1883,Chest computed tomography revealed neofibrosis and ground glass appearance pattern.
17906,1883,"After increasing the dose of prednisolone to 60 mg/day, the patient presented a manic episode."
17907,1883,There was need of hospitalization and the situation was considered to be secondary to corticosteroids at high doses.
17908,1883,Central neurological involvement by organic disease was excluded.
17909,1883,"We introduced monthly perfusion of cyclophosphamide for six months and later started mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day, reducing prednisolone to 10 mg/day and maintaining hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, with control of disease activity."
17910,1884,Neutrophilic dermatoses have long been known to be associated with autoinmune systemic diseases.
17911,1884,"Recently, a small number of cases of a disorder distinct from Sweet syndrome or bullous lupus erythematosus (LE) have been described as specifically related to systemic LE under diverse terms, including nonbullous neutrophilic dermatosis, nonbullous neutrophilic LE, and Sweet-like neutrophilic dermatosis."
17912,1884,We describe 7 patients that developed urticarial lesions in the context of a known or concurrently diagnosed autoimmune connective tissue disease.
17913,1884,"Of a total of 7 patients, 6 were afflicted by systemic LE and 1 by rheumatoid arthritis and secondary Sjgren syndrome."
17914,1884,"Histological findings in all patients included an interstitial and perivascular neutrophilic infiltrate with leukocytoclasia, vacuolar alteration along the dermal-edidermal junction, and no vasculitis."
17915,1884,Most patients had active systemic disease at the time of the cutaneous eruption.
17916,1884,Skin lesions resolved rapidly after the administration of immunomodulating agents.
17917,1884,"In conclusion, we provide additional evidence of the existence of a recently defined nonbullous neutrophilic dermatosis in the context of autoimmune connective tissue diseases and propose the term autoimmunity-related neutrophilic dermatosis as an appropriate designation."
17918,1884,"Furthermore, we believe that this entity should prompt physicians to screen the presence of an active systemic disorder in afflicted patients."
17919,1885,"We have demonstrated previously that, in primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS), immature myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) are decreased in blood and mature myeloid DCs are accumulated in salivary glands, suggesting recruitment of the myeloid DCs from blood to salivary glands."
17920,1885,"To verify whether this finding is universal in patients of not only primary SS but also secondary SS, in this study we analysed the blood DCs of secondary SS patients."
17921,1885,We examined 24 secondary SS and 29 primary SS patients.
17922,1885,"A direct correlation between the decreased number of myeloid DCs and the duration of Sicca syndrome in primary and secondary SS was observed; namely, the reduction of myeloid DCs in blood was restored spontaneously with duration time of Sicca syndrome."
17923,1885,"We also examined the immunohistochemical staining of salivary glands of SS patients with monoclonal antibodies against fascin, CD11c and human leucocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR)."
17924,1885,"Fascin(+) or CD11c(+)/HLA-DR(+) mononuclear cells were present in the salivary glands of secondary SS patients, as in primary SS."
17925,1885,"However, fascin(+) mononuclear cells were barely detected in the salivary glands of a chronic phase of SS patients."
17926,1885,"We also found a negative correlation between the frequency of blood myeloid DCs and salivary gland-infiltrating DCs in secondary SS patients, as well as primary SS."
17927,1885,Our results suggest that the reduction of blood myeloid DCs and preferential trafficking of myeloid DCs into salivary glands is a common event in the early stage of SS.
17928,1885,Myeloid DCs may play essential roles in the pathogenesis of Sicca syndrome of SS by initiating T helper cell immune responses.
17929,1886,"Sjgren's Syndrome (SS) is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by lacrimal gland lymphocytic infiltration and epithelial cell death, as well as by the presence of serum autoantibodies."
17930,1886,"Although the symptoms of this syndrome are well characterized, patients are not diagnosed until 5-10 years into disease progression; furthermore, the early series of events leading to the initiation of SS are not well understood."
17931,1886,"In order to better understand the early events of the disease, we have been using ovariectomized (OVX) NOD.B10.H2(b) mice as a genetically predisposed model of SS."
17932,1886,"Previously, we have shown that removal of ovarian hormones through ovariectomy accelerated the symptoms of this disease, and in early events of SS in the lacrimal glands, lymphocytic infiltration preceded acinar cell apoptosis."
17933,1886,"To further elucidate the earlier events of this disease in the SS animal model, we investigated the expression and concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lacrimal glands as well as the presence of autoantibodies in both lacrimal glands and serum."
17934,1886,"Six weeks old NOD.B10.H2(b) and C57BL/10 control mice were either sham-operated, OVX, OVX and treated with 17-estradiol (E2), or OVX and treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT)."
17935,1886,"Lacrimal glands were collected at 3, 7, 21, and 30 days after surgery and analyzed for cytokines IL-1, TNF-, IFN-, IL-10, and IL-4 gene expression by using quantitative RT-PCR and for cytokine levels using ELISA."
17936,1886,"Furthermore, anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB autoantibodies were measured in the serum and lacrimal glands supernatants using ELISA."
17937,1886,"The results of this study showed that OVX caused a significant increase in the expression and levels of the cytokines IL-1, TNF-, and IL-4 in the lacrimal glands of the NOD.B10.H2(b) mice starting at 3 days after OVX, while a significant increase of IL-10 gene expression and levels was observed only at later experimental time points."
17938,1886,"A small but significant increase in the expression of IL-1 and IL-4 was observed only at later experimental time points in the lacrimal glands of OVX C57BL/10 mice, while no significant changes in the expression of TNF- and IL-10 were seen at any experimental times in this group."
17939,1886,"No significant differences were observed in the levels of the cytokines IL-1, TNF-, IL-4, and IL-10 in the lacrimal glands of the OVX C57BL/10 mice at any of the experimental times studied compared to the sham-operated group."
17940,1886,IFN- was not detected in either mouse strains at the level of mRNA and protein.
17941,1886,"OVX in the NOD.B10.H2(b) mice also caused an increase in the levels of anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies in the serum only, while no anti-La/SSB autoantibodies were found in the serum or lacrimal gland supernatants."
17942,1886,Physiological doses of E2 or DHT at time of OVX prevented the upregulation of cytokines and the presence of anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies in these animals.
17943,1886,"These results showed that a decrease in the concentrations of ovarian hormones in the genetically predisposed mice accelerated the onset of the disease by upregulating various pro-inflammatory cytokines at different time points and promoting the formation of anti-Ro/SSA serum autoantibodies, creating an environment favorable for the initiation of SS."
17944,1887,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a common, autoimmune exocrinopathy distinguished by keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia."
17945,1887,"Patients frequently develop serious complications including lymphoma, pulmonary dysfunction, neuropathy, vasculitis, and debilitating fatigue."
17946,1887,Dysregulation of type I interferon (IFN) pathway is a prominent feature of SS and is correlated with increased autoantibody titers and disease severity.
17947,1887,"To identify genetic determinants of IFN pathway dysregulation in SS, we performed cis-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses focusing on differentially expressed type I IFN-inducible transcripts identified through a transcriptome profiling study."
17948,1887,Multiple cis-eQTLs were associated with transcript levels of 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) peaking at rs10774671 (PeQTL = 6.05  10-14).
17949,1887,Association of rs10774671 with SS susceptibility was identified and confirmed through meta-analysis of two independent cohorts (Pmeta = 2.59  10-9; odds ratio = 0.75; 95% confidence interval = 0.66-0.86).
17950,1887,"The risk allele of rs10774671 shifts splicing of OAS1 from production of the p46 isoform to multiple alternative transcripts, including p42, p48, and p44."
17951,1887,We found that the isoforms were differentially expressed within each genotype in controls and patients with and without autoantibodies.
17952,1887,"Furthermore, our results showed that the three alternatively spliced isoforms lacked translational response to type I IFN stimulation."
17953,1887,The p48 and p44 isoforms also had impaired protein expression governed by the 3' end of the transcripts.
17954,1887,"The SS risk allele of rs10774671 has been shown by others to be associated with reduced OAS1 enzymatic activity and ability to clear viral infections, as well as reduced responsiveness to IFN treatment."
17955,1887,Our results establish OAS1 as a risk locus for SS and support a potential role for defective viral clearance due to altered IFN response as a genetic pathophysiological basis of this complex autoimmune disease.
17956,1888,The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients with IgG4 positive (IgG4(+)) plasma cell infiltration in labial salivary glands (LSGs).
17957,1888,Paraffin sections of LSGs from 336 pSS patients were stained with IgG4 and IgG monoclonal antibodies.
17958,1888,"According to the infiltration of IgG4(+) plasma cells, patients were divided and clinical and serological characteristics were analyzed and compared."
17959,1888,"Based on the infiltration of IgG4(+) plasma cells in the LSGs, patients were divided into three subgroups, low IgG4, moderate IgG4, and high IgG4 groups."
17960,1888,A negative association between the number of infiltrated IgG4(+) plasma cells and the disease characteristics was observed.
17961,1888,"We found that the higher the IgG4(+) expression in plasma cells, the lower the positive rates of serum anti-SSA antibodies, anti-SSB antibodies, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and rheumatoid factor (RF)."
17962,1888,"Besides, patients from the high IgG4 group had the highest frequency of interstitial lung disease (ILD, 30.6%) and tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN, 13.9%), but the lowest frequency of leucopenia (13.9%), thrombocytopenia (11.1%), and abnormal thyroidal function (0%)."
17963,1888,PSS patients with different IgG4(+) plasma cells infiltration in the LSGs had distinctive clinical and laboratory characteristics.
17964,1888,It may help us to further understand the role of IgG4(+) plasma cells in pSS.
17965,1889,Patients suffering from autoimmune rheumatic diseases have significantly higher risk of developing various infections compared to the healthy population.
17966,1889,"Our study included patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 30), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 37) or Sjgren's syndrome (n = 32), with stable underlying diseases status."
17967,1889,"In November 2010, 47 patients, including 35 subjects vaccinated annually during 2006-2010, received immunization against influenza with trivalent inactivated split vaccine, whereas 52 patients did not accept proposed vaccination in that period."
17968,1889,"The presence of viral (primarily influenza) and bacterial infections, parameters of disease activity (from the date of vaccination until April 2011), and titers of antibodies against A H1N1 were then monitored in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients."
17969,1889,We have identified the importance of predisposing factors for influenza occurrence (i.e.
17970,1889,"previous respiratory infections and vaccinations in last five years, age, sex, type of disease and duration, medications, smoking) in those groups of patients."
17971,1889,"The incidence of influenza or bacterial complications (bronchitis) among vaccinated patients was significantly lower, compared to the non-vaccinated group."
17972,1889,"Importantly, there was no case of exacerbation of the underlying disease."
17973,1889,"The last vaccination in 2010 reduced the risk of influenza by 87%, but previous bacterial infections (bronchitis and pneumonia) increased influenza risk significantly."
17974,1889,"In the present study, we have shown the efficiency, sufficient immunogenicity and safety of modern influenza vaccine application in patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis or Sjgren's syndrome."
17975,1890,Th17 related immune response is pathogenic in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
17976,1890,"However, the role of IL-17F, one potent inflammatory member of IL-17 family cytokines in pSS, has not been specifically defined."
17977,1890,We recruited one hundred and nine pSS patients and forty-two healthy controls and their serum levels of IL-17A and IL-17F were determined by multiplex cytokine assays.
17978,1890,"White blood cell, red blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, IgM, IgG, C3, C4, RF, ANA, anti-SSA antibody, and anti-SSB antibody were measured by standard laboratory techniques."
17979,1890,EULAR Sjgren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI) score was also evaluated accordingly.
17980,1890,We found that IL-17F was significantly increased in pSS patients.
17981,1890,"Elevated levels of IL-17F were associated with increased IgG and IgM, higher titers of ANA and anti-SSA antibodies, and reduction of C3 and C4."
17982,1890,Patients with higher disease activity also showed higher serum IL-17F levels.
17983,1890,"However, serum IL-17A was only increased in patients with longer disease duration and showed few correlation with clinical and laboratory features in pSS patients."
17984,1890,"In conclusion, IL-17F was correlated with increased autoantibody levels and disease activity in pSS and is more clinically relevant than IL-17A."
17985,1891,"Patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS), an autoimmune disease primarily affecting exocrine glands, exhibit enhanced TNF- expression in the saliva and salivary glands."
17986,1891,"However, the precise in vivo role of TNF- during the initiation and development of SS is not clearly defined."
17987,1891,"The present study is undertaken to determine the function of endogenously produced TNF- in the pathogenesis of SS in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a model of this human disease."
17988,1891,"Administration of a neutralizing anti-TNF- antibody to female NOD mice during the stage prior to disease onset significantly improved salivary secretion, indicating a remission of clinical symptoms of SS."
17989,1891,TNF- blockade also decreased the number of leukocyte foci and reduced the number of T cells and B cells in the submandibular glands (SMG).
17990,1891,"Moreover, TNF- blockade reduced T-bet protein levels in the SMG, suggesting a decrease in T helper 1 and T cytotoxic 1 cells."
17991,1891,These cellular changes induced by TNF- neutralization were associated with a reduction in T- and B-cell chemoattractants CXCL9 and CXC13.
17992,1891,"In addition, TNF- blockade markedly increased the expression level of tight junction protein claudin-1 and water channel protein aquaporin-5, two key factors required for normal salivary secretion, in the SMG."
17993,1891,"Collectively, these findings indicate that endogenous TNF- has a pathogenic role in the development of SS in the NOD model of this disease."
17994,1892,"BACKGROUND: To give an overview on implant survival rates in patients with oral manifestations of systemic autoimmune (oral Lichen planus (oLp), Pemphigus (Pe)), muco-cutaneous (Epidermolysis bullosa (EB)), autoimmune multisystemic rheumatic diseases (Sjgren's syndrome (SjS), systemic Lupus erythematosus (sLE), or systemic Sclerosis (sSc))."
17995,1892,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: Systematic literature review (PubMed/Medline, Embase) using MESH and search term combinations, published between 1980 and August 2018 in English language reporting on dental implant-prosthetic rehabilitation of patients with oLp, Pe, EB, SjS, sLE, sSc, study design, age, gender, follow-up period ( 12 months), implant survival rate."
17996,1892,Implant-related weighed mean values of implant survival rate (wmSR) were calculated.
17997,1892,"RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period (mfp) of 44.6 months, a wmSR of 98.3 % was calculated from data published for patients with oLp (100 patients with 302 implants)."
17998,1892,Data of 27 patients (152 implants) with EB revealed wmSR of 98.7 % following mfp of 32.6 months.
17999,1892,"For 71 patients (272 implants) with SjS, wmSR was 94.2 % following a mfp of 45.2 months, and for 6 patients (44 implants) with sSc, wmSR was 97.7 % after mfp of 37.5 months."
18000,1892,One case report on one patient each with Pe (two implants) as well as sLE (6 implants) showed 100 % SR following at least 24 months.
18001,1892,"CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines regarding implant treatment of patients with oLp, Pe, EB, SjS, sLE or sSc do not exist nor are contraindicating conditions defined."
18002,1892,Implant survival rates of patients affected are comparable to those of healthy patients.
18003,1892,For implant-prosthetic rehabilitation of patients with Pe and sLE no conclusions can be drawn due to lack of sufficient clinical data.
18004,1892,"Implant-prosthetic treatment guidelines regarding healthy patients should be strictly followed, but frequent recall is recommended in patients affected with oLp, SjS, EB, SSc, Pe or sLE."
18005,1893,"OBJECTIVE: In the sanroque mouse model of lupus, pathologic germinal centers (GCs) arise due to increased numbers of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, resulting in high-affinity anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies that cause end-organ inflammation, such as glomerulonephritis."
18006,1893,The purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that this pathway could account for a subset of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
18007,1893,"METHODS: An expansion of Tfh cells is a causal, and therefore consistent, component of the sanroque mouse phenotype."
18008,1893,"We validated the enumeration of circulating T cells resembling Tfh cells as a biomarker of this expansion in sanroque mice, and we performed a comprehensive comparison of the surface phenotype of circulating and tonsillar Tfh cells in humans."
18009,1893,"This circulating biomarker was enumerated in SLE patients (n = 46), Sjgren's syndrome patients (n = 17), and healthy controls (n = 48) and was correlated with disease activity and end-organ involvement."
18010,1893,"RESULTS: In sanroque mice, circulating Tfh cells increased in proportion to their GC counterparts, making circulating Tfh cells a feasible human biomarker of this novel mechanism of breakdown in GC tolerance."
18011,1893,"In a subset of SLE patients (14 of 46), but in none of the controls, the levels of circulating Tfh cells (defined as circulating CXCR5+CD4+ cells with high expression of Tfh-associated molecules, such as inducible T cell costimulator or programmed death 1) were increased."
18012,1893,"This cellular phenotype did not vary with time, disease activity, or treatment, but it did correlate with the diversity and titers of autoantibodies and with the severity of end-organ involvement."
18013,1893,CONCLUSION: These findings in SLE patients are consistent with the autoimmune mechanism in sanroque mice and identify Tfh effector molecules as possible therapeutic targets in a recognizable subset of patients with SLE.
18014,1894,"To investigate the pathogenesis of localized autoimmune damage in Sjgren's syndrome (SS) by examining the expression patterns of cytokines, chemokines and chemokine receptors at sites of autoimmune damage."
18015,1894,mRNA expression of these molecules in the labial salivary glands (LSGs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 36 SS patients was examined using a real-time polymerase chain reaction-based method.
18016,1894,Subsets of the infiltrating lymphocytes and chemokines/chemokine receptors expression in the LSG specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry.
18017,1894,Cytokines/chemokine concentrations in the saliva were analysed using flow cytometry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
18018,1894,"mRNA expression of T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines, chemokines and chemokine receptors was higher in LSGs than in PBMCs."
18019,1894,"In contrast, mRNA expression of Th2 cytokines, chemokines [thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17), macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22)] and chemokine receptor (CCR4) was associated closely with strong lymphocytic accumulation in LSGs."
18020,1894,"Furthermore, TARC and MDC were detected immunohistochemically in/around the ductal epithelial cells in LSGs, whereas CCR4 was detected on infiltrating lymphocytes."
18021,1894,"The concentrations of these cytokines/chemokines were significantly higher in the saliva from SS patients than those from controls, and the concentrations of Th2 cytokines/chemokines were associated closely with strong lymphocytic accumulation in LSGs."
18022,1894,These results suggest that SS might be initiated and/or maintained by Th1 and Th17 cells and progress in association with Th2 cells via the interaction between particular chemokines/chemokine receptors.
18023,1894,"Furthermore, the measurement of cytokines/chemokines in saliva is suggested to be useful for diagnosis and also to reveal disease status."
18024,1895,Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) is a rare lung disease on the spectrum of benign pulmonary lymphoproliferative disorders.
18025,1895,LIP is frequently associated with connective tissue diseases or infections.
18026,1895,Idiopathic LIP is rare; every attempt must be made to diagnose underlying conditions when LIP is diagnosed.
18027,1895,"Computed tomography of the chest in patients with LIP may reveal ground-glass opacities, centrilobular and subpleural nodules, and randomly distributed thin-walled cysts."
18028,1895,Demonstrating polyclonality with immunohistochemistry is the key to differentiating LIP from lymphoma.
18029,1895,The 5-year mortality remains between 33% and 50% and is likely to vary based on the underlying disease process.
18030,1896,"INTRODUCTION: The kidney is one of the common extraglandular sites involved in primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS), with chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) the most common pathology type."
18031,1896,Renal involvement in pSS often presents as chronic TIN accompanied by type 1 or 2 renal tubular acidosis (RTA).
18032,1896,Description of renal involvement as acute TIN with type III RTA in pSS has been rarely reported.
18033,1896,"PATIENT CONCERNS: A 37-year-old woman was admitted with complaints of dry mouth, dry eyes, and progressive muscle weakness for 17 months."
18034,1896,"Two months before admission, the patient had a blood potassium level of 1.7 mmol/L."
18035,1896,DIAGNOSIS: Further tests confirmed pSS and type III RTA.
18036,1896,Renal biopsy demonstrated acute TIN and thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN).
18037,1896,INTERVENTIONS: Full-dose corticosteroid (1mg/kg/day) and cyclophosphamide (100mg/day) were applied.
18038,1896,OUTCOMES: The creatinine levels of the patient decreased 0.28mg/dL (1.18-0.90mg/dL) during 3-month follow-up.
18039,1896,"CONCLUSIONS: We reported a patient with pSS-associated kidney injury, presenting as acute TIN with type 3 RTA and TBMN."
18040,1896,This case increases the awareness of a rare manifestation of pSS-associated kidney injury.
18041,1896,"In pSS-associated acute TIN, cyclophosphamide combined with full-dose corticosteroids may achieve good outcomes."
18042,1897,PURPOSE: To investigate the association between visual function and ocular surface regularity in dry eye.
18043,1897,METHODS: We enrolled 52 eyes of 52 dry eye patients (34 dry eyes with superficial punctate keratopathy [SPK] in the central corneal region [central SPK] and 18 dry eyes without central SPK) and 20 eyes of 20 normal control subjects.
18044,1897,All eyes had a best-corrected distance visual acuity better than 20/20.
18045,1897,We measured two indices of contrast sensitivity function under photopic conditions: contrast sensitivity and letter contrast sensitivity.
18046,1897,The area under the log contrast sensitivity function (AULCSF) was calculated from the obtained contrast sensitivity data.
18047,1897,Straylight was quantified using a straylight meter.
18048,1897,"RESULTS: Dry eyes with central SPK had significantly decreased contrast sensitivity function, including AULCSF and letter contrast sensitivity than those without central SPK and normal eyes (P < 0.05 for each)."
18049,1897,"While the straylight values in both dry eye groups did not differ, straylight values were greater than those in normal eyes (P < 0.05 for both)."
18050,1897,"In dry eye, the AULCSF and letter contrast sensitivity negatively correlated with the central SPK score (R = -0.485, P < 0.001, and R = -0.541, P < 0.001, respectively)."
18051,1897,"CONCLUSIONS: In dry eye, reduced contrast sensitivity in part results from central SPK overlying the optical zone and the increased straylight results from tear film instability rather than central SPK."
18052,1898,"PURPOSE: To investigate the expression pattern of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (Nod)-like receptors that detects ""danger"" intracellular signaling and its correlation with clinical dry eye (DE) markers."
18053,1898,DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
18054,1898,"METHODS: A total of 50 participants with 50 eyes were included: 23 eyes with Sjgren syndrome (SS)-DE, 14 eyes with non-SS-DE, and 13 healthy controls with non-DE."
18055,1898,"Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) was self-answered and clinical tests including the tear film breakup time (TBUT), Schirmer test, and corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) were performed."
18056,1898,Specimens for expression pattern analysis were obtained by conjunctival impression cytology and biopsy.
18057,1898,"Nod-1, inhibitor kappa B kinase-alpha (IK), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) expression was determined by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot."
18058,1898,Correlations between Nod-1 and ocular surface parameters were determined.
18059,1898,RESULTS: Patients with SS-DE had significantly higher OSDI and CFS scores and lower TBUT and Schirmer test scores than those with non-SS-DE patients (all P < .05).
18060,1898,"Compared with the control group, both the SS-DE and non-SS-DE groups showed significant upregulation in mRNA expression levels of Nod-1 (relative 3.48-fold and 1.72-fold upregulation, respectively, P < .01), IK (relative 1.83-fold and 1.24-fold upregulation, respectively, P < .01), and NF-B (relative 1.84-fold and 1.32-fold upregulation, respectively, P < .01)."
18061,1898,"Western blot analysis showed that Nod-1 protein expression increased in both the SS-DE and non-SS-DE groups (relative 2.71-fold and 1.64-fold upregulation, respectively, P < .05) compared with that in the control group."
18062,1898,Similar findings were observed for IK and NF-B.
18063,1898,"In DE participants, the expression of Nod-1 significantly correlated with the OSDI (R(2)= 0.61, r= 0.78, P<.01), Schirmer test score (R(2)= 0.44, r= -0.66, P < .01), and CFS (R(2)= 0.46, r= 0.68, P < .01) but did not significantly correlate with TBUT (R(2) <0.01, r= 0.08, P= .66)."
18064,1898,"CONCLUSIONS: Nod-1 expression was increased in the conjunctiva of DE, especially SS-DE, and was associated with disease severity."
18065,1898,Expression of Nod-like receptors might play an important role in initiating the inflammatory response in DE.
18066,1899,BACKGROUND: Evaluating lymphocytic infiltration of minor salivary gland biopsy in primary Sjgren's syndrome is challenging.
18067,1899,We developed and evaluated a digital method for quantifying B and T lymphocytes in whole minor salivary gland biopsy slides.
18068,1899,METHODS: Minor salivary gland biopsies were immunostained with anti-CD20/anti-CD3 antibodies using red/brown chromogens.
18069,1899,Slides were digitised and spliced into mosaics of smaller JPEG format images in which red and brown pixels were counted.
18070,1899,ImageJ Cell counter was used for validation.
18071,1899,Agreement between the digital and manual methods was evaluated using Bland-Altman plots and the interclass correlation coefficient.
18072,1899,"External validation relied on the Chisholm-Mason, Tarpley, and focus-score methods."
18073,1899,"RESULTS: Of 62 minor salivary gland biopsy slides, 61.3% had a Chisholm-Mason gradeIII or a focus score 1."
18074,1899,The number of pixels correlated well with manual cell counts (r=0.95 for red pixels vs. B cell count and r=0.91 for brown pixels vs. T cell count).
18075,1899,Interclass correlation coefficients between digital and manual counts were excellent (0.92 for B/T cells).
18076,1899,"B-cell proportion showed a significant positive correlation with the focus score (Spearman's coefficient 0.463, p<0.0001)."
18077,1899,"Median B-cell proportion was lower in minor salivary gland biopsies with Chisholm grades I-II (2.5% (0.2-13.9)) than III-IV (30.0% (15.5-45.2)) and increased with Tarpley's class (1, 2.2% (0.2-6.6); 2, 27.2% (13.0-38.9); and 3-4, 48.5% (29.4-56.4); p<0.001 for all comparisons)."
18078,1899,"Minor salivary gland biopsy B-cell proportion was also significantly correlated with several markers of clinical and biological activity of the disease, especially with markers of systemic B-cell hyperactivation."
18079,1899,"CONCLUSION: The digital procedure proved accurate compared to the reference standard, producing reliable results for whole tissue sections."

18081,1899,Registered 22 August 2008.
18082,1900,BACKGROUND: The total glucosides of paeony (TGP) can inhibit inflammation and alleviate symptoms in autoimmune diseases.
18083,1900,This study investigated the clinical and immunological consequences of TGP treatment in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
18084,1900,"METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 45 patients with primary SS."
18085,1900,Patients were randomized at 2:1 ratio to either TGP group (n=29) or placebo group (n=16) and followed up for 24weeks.
18086,1900,The primary outocme was the European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI).
18087,1900,"The secondary outcomes were stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow rate, Schirmer's test and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), immuneglobulin (Ig), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-SSA, and anti-SSB."
18088,1900,"The proportions of B cells in peripheral blood and the levels of serum inerleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interferon- (IFN-) and B cell activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) were measured at baseline and at the end of follow up of 24weeks."
18089,1900,RESULTS: The average score of ESSPRI in both groups had no statistical significance at 24th week.
18090,1900,The mean of ESSPRI in the dry-mouth part of questionnaire in patients who scored 3 to 6 points was significantly reduced in the TGP group changed from (4.810.60) at baseline to (4.201.46) (P=0.027) at week 24.
18091,1900,"Stimulated salivary flow rate increased at week 24 from (1.800.39) to (2.010.51) (P=0.031) and unstimulated salivary flow rate increased from (0.650.46) to (0.780.45) (P=0.011) in the TGP group, but the placebo group showed no significant difference."
18092,1900,Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was decreased significantly compared to the placebo group at 12- and 24-week from (40.918.0) to (29.412.2) (P=0.003) and (30.417.3) (P=0.024).
18093,1900,The percentage of naive B cells decreased at week 24 in the TGP group from (77.3412.20) to (64.5915.60) (P=0.005) while memory B cells increased from (21.7911.97) to (34.2115.48) (P=0.006) respectively.
18094,1900,"The concentrations of TNF- and IFN- decreased in the TGP group at week 24 from (32.5126.67) to (24.2213.56) (P=0.017) and (10.718.94) to (6.554.88) (P=0.022), respectively."
18095,1900,"No significant difference in ANA titer, anti-SSA antibodies, anti-SSB antibodies, C3 concentration or C4 concentration was observed between the two groups."
18096,1900,CONCLUSION: TGP appears to improve the glandular secreting function and decrease the level of inflammatory cytokines.
18097,1901,"Non-uremic calciphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening condition characterized clinically by cutaneous necrosis and histologically by calcium deposition in small vessel walls."
18098,1901,The etiology of non-uremic calciphylaxis remains the subject of ongoing speculation and debate.
18099,1901,"Herein we present a patient with calciphylaxis who had normal kidney function and numerous rheumatologic diseases, namely systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren syndrome (SS), and myasthenia gravis (MG)."
18100,1901,"We review the pathophysiology, possible mechanisms, and management for non-uremic calciphylaxis."
18101,1902,Decreased corneal innervation is frequent in patients with Sjgren Syndrome (SS).
18102,1902,"To investigate the density and morphology of the intraepithelial corneal nerves (ICNs), corneal sensitivity, epithelial cell proliferation, and changes in mRNA expression of genes that are involved in autophagy and axon targeting and extension were assessed using the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25 null) model of SS."
18103,1902,"ICN density and thickness in male and female wt and CD25 null corneas were assessed at 4, 6, 8, and 10/11 wk of age."
18104,1902,Cell proliferation was assessed using ki67.
18105,1902,Mechanical corneal sensitivity was measured.
18106,1902,"Quantitative PCR was performed to quantify expression of beclin 1, LC3, Lamp-1, Lamp-2, CXCL-1, BDNF, NTN1, DCC, Unc5b1, Efna4, Efna5, Rgma, and p21 in corneal epithelial mRNA."
18107,1902,"A significant reduction in corneal axon density and mechanical sensitivity were observed, which negatively correlate with epithelial cell proliferation."
18108,1902,"CD25 null mice have increased expression of genes regulating autophagy (beclin-1, LC3, LAMP-1, LAMP-2, CXCL1, and BDNF) and no change was observed in genes that were related to axonal targeting and extension."
18109,1902,"Decreased anatomic corneal innervation in the CD25 null SS model is accompanied by reduced corneal sensitivity, increased corneal epithelial cell proliferation, and increased expression of genes regulating phagocytosis and autophagy."
18110,1903,BACKGROUND: Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice develop Sjgren's-like disease (SS-like) with loss of saliva flow and increased lymphocytic infiltrates in salivary glands (SGs).
18111,1903,There are recent reports using multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as a therapeutic strategy for autoimmune diseases due to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory capabilities.
18112,1903,"This paper proposed a combined immuno- and cell-based therapy consisting of: A) an injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) to eradicate autoreactive T lymphocytes, and B) transplantations of MSCs to reselect lymphocytes."
18113,1903,The objective of this was to test the effectiveness of CD45(-)/TER119(-) cells (MSCs) in re-establishing salivary function and in reducing the number of lymphocytic infiltrates (foci) in SGs.
18114,1903,"The second objective was to study if the mechanisms underlying a decrease in inflammation (focus score) was due to CFA, MSCs, or CFA+MSCs combined."
18115,1903,METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Donor MSCs were isolated from bones of male transgenic eGFP mice.
18116,1903,"Eight week-old female NOD mice received one of the following treatments: insulin, CFA, MSC, or CFA+MSC (combined therapy)."
18117,1903,Mice were followed for 14 weeks post-therapy.
18118,1903,"CD45(-)/TER119(-) cells demonstrated characteristics of MSCs as they were positive for Sca-1, CD106, CD105, CD73, CD29, CD44, negative for CD45, TER119, CD11b, had high number of CFU-F, and differentiated into osteocytes, chondrocytes and adipocytes."
18119,1903,Both MSC and MSC+CFA groups prevented loss of saliva flow and reduced lymphocytic infiltrations in SGs.
18120,1903,"Moreover, the influx of T and B cells decreased in all foci in MSC and MSC+CFA groups, while the frequency of Foxp3(+) (T(reg)) cell was increased."
18121,1903,"MSC-therapy alone reduced inflammation (TNF-, TGF-), but the combination of MSC+CFA reduced inflammation and increased the regenerative potential of SGs (FGF-2, EGF)."
18122,1903,CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The combined use of MSC+CFA was effective in both preventing saliva secretion loss and reducing lymphocytic influx in salivary glands.
18123,1904,Salivary gland (SG) acinar-cells are susceptible to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress related to their secretory activity and the complexity of synthesized secretory products.
18124,1904,"SGs of Sjgren's syndrome patients (SS)-patients show signs of inflammation and altered proteostasis, associated with low IRE1/XBP-1 pathway activity without avert increases in apoptosis."
18125,1904,Acinar-cells may avoid apoptosis by activation of the ATF6 pathway and ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD).
18126,1904,The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in ATF6 pathway/ERAD activation and cell viability in labial salivary glands (LSG) of SS-patients.
18127,1904,"In biopsies from SS-patients increased ATF6 signaling pathway activity, as evidenced by generation of the ATF6f cleavage fragment, and increased expression of ERAD machinery components, such as EDEM1, p97, SEL1L, gp78, UBE2J1, UBE2G2, HERP and DERLIN1, were observed compared to controls."
18128,1904,"Alternatively, for pro- (active-caspase-3) and anti-apoptotic (cIAP2) markers no significant difference between the two experimental groups was detected."
18129,1904,Increased presence of ATF6f and ERAD molecules correlated significantly with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
18130,1904,"These observations were corroborated invitro in 3D-acini treated with TNF- and/or IFN-, where an increase in the expression and activation of the ATF6 sensor and ERAD machinery components was detected under ER stress conditions, while changes in cell viability and caspase-3 activation were not observed."
18131,1904,Cytokine stimulation protected cells from death when co-incubated with an ERAD machinery inhibitor.
18132,1904,"Alternatively, when cytokines were eliminated from the medium prior to ERAD inhibition, cell death increased, suggesting that the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the medium is essential to maintain cell viability."
18133,1904,"In conclusion, the ATF6 pathway and the ERAD machinery are active in LSG of SS-patients."
18134,1904,Both were also activated by TNF- and IFN- invitro in 3D-acini and aided in preventing apoptosis.
18135,1904,"IFN- levels were elevated in SS-patients and UPR responses triggered invitro by this cytokine closely matched those observed in LSG from SS-patients, suggesting that cytokines may induce ER stress."
18136,1905,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal cerebral infarction is a relatively common cause of neonatal seizures, with an incidence of at least 1:4000 live births and is associated with a high incidence of neurological sequelae."
18137,1905,"However, the pathophysiological mechanisms and predisposing factors responsible for neonatal infarction are not fully established."
18138,1905,PATIENT DESCRIPTION: A full-term baby boy was transferred at twodays of age for the treatment of a cluster of seizures.
18139,1905,Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple lesions compatible with acute cerebral infarction.
18140,1905,"The results of the blood tests performed to screen for thrombophilic diseases were normal for his age, and his perinatal history was unremarkable."
18141,1905,A diagnosis of idiopathic cerebral infarction was made.
18142,1905,Additional examination for autoimmune diseases showed that both the mother and the patient had the anti-SS-A/Ro antibody.
18143,1905,The patient was treated with phenobarbital and has no neurological sequelae.
18144,1905,CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report demonstrating the coexistence of neonatal cerebral infarction and neonatal lupus syndrome.
18145,1905,Thus neonatal lupus syndrome may be an additional risk factor for neonatal stroke.
18146,1906,"Adult stem cells are actively investigated in the fields of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, as they exhibit specific characteristics that make them promising candidates for cellular therapies."
18147,1906,Depending on their tissue of origin these characteristics include long-term proliferation and the capacity to differentiate into various cell types.
18148,1906,To date adult stem cells have been isolated from a multitude of tissues.
18149,1906,Non-embryogenic adult tissues contain only small numbers of such stem cells and the derivation of such tissues can cause comorbidities.
18150,1906,"Therefore, there is ongoing interest in the identification and characterisation of novel cell sources for stem cell isolation and characterisation.Recently, salivary gland tissue has also been explored as a possible source of stem cells, first in animals and later in humans."
18151,1906,"Such salivary gland-derived stem cells might be useful in the treatment of radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction, and possibly also in other diseases with loss of acinar cells, such as sequelae of radio iodine treatment or Sjgren's disease.In this paper we review the current status of salivary gland stem cell biology and application and discuss the possible role of stem cells in the development of novel therapies for salivary gland dysfunctions such as postradiogenic xerostomia."
18152,1907,"Sjgren syndrome (SS) has been known to manifest with neurological complications, most frequently of the peripheral nervous system, and often in advance of xerostomia and xerophthalmia."
18153,1907,There has been one case report of a patient with SS presenting with acute motor neuropathy similar to Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS).
18154,1907,We report the case of a patient who developed rapidly fulminant acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) with positive anti-GM1 antibody at high titers in association with serological and pathological evidence of SS without xerostomia or xerophthalmia.
18155,1908,We treated a 45-year-old Japanese woman with primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) complicated with dermatomyositis (DM) followed by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
18156,1908,"She was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation of fever, weight loss and peritoneal lymphadenopathy."
18157,1908,The histological examination of her lymph node revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
18158,1908,"The patient was then treated with 8 cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) therapy, which resulted in histological and functional improvement of her salivary glands."
18159,1908,"Of note, the percentage of effector memory Th17-1 (CD3+CD4+CD45RA-CCR7-CXCR3+CCR6+) cells in the peripheral blood was decreased after the R-CHOP treatment."
18160,1908,"This case suggests that an altered Th17-1 cell subset by B-cell depletion therapy is critical for the improvement of tissue damage in patients with SS, and the case suggests that clinicians should consider measuring the effector memory Th-subsets to predict the disease activity in SS patients."
18161,1909,The tumor-necrosis-factor-converting-enzyme (TACE)-TNF--Amphiregulin (AREG) axis plays an important pathogenic role in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.
18162,1909,"However, the pathological roles of these proteins in the chronic autoimmune disease Sjgren's syndrome (SS) remain to be elucidated."
18163,1909,"It is known that the TACE-AREG axis is clearly part of a larger cascade of signals that starts with the activation of Furin, responsible for maturation of TACE that, in turn, determines the production of active TNF-, directly involved in the up-regulation of AREG expression."
18164,1909,"This study showed that Furin, TACE, TNF-, and AREG proteins, detected in acinar and ductal cells of human salivary glands from SS patients, increased remarkably in comparison with biopsies of labial salivary glands from healthy controls."
18165,1909,"The changes in Furin, TACE, TNF- , and AREG proteins' level detected in salivary glands biopsies of SS patients could be responsible for pro-inflammatory cytokines overexpression characterizing Sjgren's syndrome."
18166,1910,BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by ocular and oral dryness or systemic manifestations.
18167,1910,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and harms of rituximab in adults with recent-onset or systemic pSS.
18168,1910,"DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted between March 2008 and January 2011."
18169,1910,"Study personnel (except pharmacists), investigators, and patients were blinded to treatment group."
18170,1910,(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00740948).
18171,1910,SETTING: 14 university hospitals in France.
18172,1910,"PATIENTS: 120 patients with scores of 50 mm or greater on at least 2 of 4 visual analogue scales (VASs) (global disease, pain, fatigue, and dryness) and recent-onset (< 10 years) biologically active or systemic pSS."
18173,1910,INTERVENTION: Randomization (1:1 ratio) to rituximab (1 g at weeks 0 and 2) or placebo.
18174,1910,MEASUREMENTS: Primary end point was improvement of at least 30 mm in 2 of 4 VASs by week 24.
18175,1910,"RESULTS: No significant difference between groups in the primary end point was found (difference, 1.0% [95% CI, -16.7% to 18.7%])."
18176,1910,The proportion of patients with at least 30-mm decreases in at least two of the four VAS scores was higher in the rituximab group at week 6 (22.4% vs. 9.1%; P = 0.036).
18177,1910,"An improvement of at least 30 mm in VAS fatigue score was more common with rituximab at weeks 6 (P < 0.001) and 16 (P = 0.012), and improvement in fatigue from baseline to week 24 was greater with rituximab."
18178,1910,Adverse events were similar between groups except for a higher rate of infusion reactions with rituximab.
18179,1910,LIMITATION: Low disease activity at baseline and a primary outcome that may have been insensitive to detect clinically important changes.
18180,1910,"CONCLUSION: Rituximab did not alleviate symptoms or disease activity in patients with pSS at week 24, although it alleviated some symptoms at earlier time points."
18181,1911,This large-scale survey aimed to evaluate frequencies and patterns of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) used for Sjgren's syndrome (SS) in Taiwan by analyzing the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) for cases in which CHM was used as an alternative therapy to Western medicine for improving patients' discomforts.
18182,1911,We analyzed cases of SS principal diagnosis (ICD-9:710.2) with a catastrophic illness certificate (CIC) in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) outpatient clinics from three cohorts of the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID) in the NHIRD between 2002 and 2011.
18183,1911,CHM prescription patterns for SS were evaluated from claimed visitation files and corresponding prescription files.
18184,1911,"There were 15,914 SS patients with CIC (SS/CIC), and we found only 130 SS/CIC cases visiting TCM clinics in LHID2000, 133 in LHID2005, and 126 in LHID2010."
18185,1911,"After removing duplicate data, 366 SS/CIC and 4,867 visits were analyzed."
18186,1911,The 50-59 year age group showed the highest ratio (29.51%) in both women and men.

18191,1912,"Sjgren's syndrome (SS) patients manifest high cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) levels in serum, associated with impaired DNaseI activity."
18192,1912,Undegraded DNA may accumulate in tissues and act as an inflammasome-activating signal.
18193,1912,"Herein, we investigated the occurrence of aberrant DNA build-up in various biologic compartments of SS patients and its correlation with the activity of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes."
18194,1912,"For this purpose, we evaluated sera, PBMC, circulating monocytes and salivary glands (SG) from different SS patient subgroups and controls."
18195,1912,"We found that SS patients at high risk for lymphoma and those with established lymphoma display high serum cf-DNA levels, substantial extranuclear DNA accumulations in PBMC and SG tissues, a unique NLRP3 inflammasome gene signature in PBMC, and significantly increased serum IL-18 and ASC levels."
18196,1912,"In these patients, the circulating monocytes manifested NLRP3 inflammasome activation and increased response to NLRP3 stimuli, whereas SG-infiltrating macrophages exhibited signs of NLRP3 activation and pyroptosis."
18197,1912,Cell-free nucleic acids isolated from patients' sera competently primed the activation of both NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes in healthy monocytes.
18198,1912,"SS patients also manifested diminished DNaseI activity in serum and DNaseII expression in PBMC, which inversely correlated with indices of inflammasome activation."
18199,1912,DNaseII gene-silencing in healthy monocytes led to cytoplasmic DNA deposition and activation of inflammasome-related genes and of caspase1.
18200,1912,"Our data reveal the occurrence of systemic NLRP3 inflammasome activation in severe SS, which is associated with widespread extranuclear accumulations of inflammagenic DNA and impaired DNA degradation."
18201,1912,These findings can provide novel biomarkers and new therapeutic targets for the management of SS patients with adverse outcomes.
18202,1913,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the safety and efficacy of the off-label use of rituximab in patients with severe, refractory systemic autoimmune diseases."
18203,1913,"METHODS: In 2006, the Study Group on Autoimmune Diseases of the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine created the BIOGEAS project, a multicenter study devoted to collecting data on the use of biological agents in adult patients with systemic autoimmune diseases refractory to standard therapies (failure of at least two immunosuppressive agents)."
18204,1913,"RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-six patients with systemic autoimmune diseases treated with rituximab have been included in the Registry (158 women and 38 men, mean age 43 years)."
18205,1913,"Systemic autoimmune diseases included systemic lupus erythematosus (107 cases), inflammatory myopathies (20 cases), ANCA-related vasculitides (19 cases), Sjgren's syndrome (15 cases) and other diseases (35 cases)."
18206,1913,"A therapeutic response was evaluable in 194 cases: 99 (51%) achieved a complete response, 51 (26%) a partial response and 44 (23%) were classified as non-responders."
18207,1913,"After a mean follow-up of 27.56+/-1.32 months, 44 (29%) out of the 150 responders patients relapsed."
18208,1913,There were 40 adverse events reported in 33 (16%) of the 196 patients.
18209,1913,"The most frequent adverse events were infections, with 24 episodes being described in 19 patients."
18210,1913,"Thirteen (7%) patients died, mainly due to disease progression (7 cases) and infection (3 cases)."
18211,1913,"CONCLUSIONS: Although not yet licensed for this use, rituximab is currently used to treat severe, refractory systemic autoimmune diseases, with the most favourable results being observed in Sjgren's syndrome, inflammatory myopathies, systemic lupus erythematosus and cryoglobulinemia."
18212,1914,"BACKGROUND: Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease mainly characterised by focal mononuclear cell infiltration in the salivary and lacrimal glands, and by the symptoms xerostomia and keratoconjunctivitis sicca."
18213,1914,Germinal centre-like structures (GC) are found in the minor salivary glands of approximately 25% of patients.
18214,1914,"In this study, we aimed to assess genetic variations in pSS patients with GC-like formations (GC+) compared with patients without such formations (GC-)."
18215,1914,"METHODS: Minor salivary gland biopsies from Swedish and Norwegian pSS patients (n=320) were evaluated for GC-like formations, identifying 76 GC+ and 244 GC- patients."
18216,1914,A panel of 1536 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 107 genes was genotyped.
18217,1914,"Minor allele frequencies in GC+ and GC- patients were compared using Fisher's exact test, and associations were considered significant when p<4.710(-4) and suggestive when p<0.01."
18218,1914,"RESULTS: In this case-only analysis, we identified two SNPs in CCL11 (eotaxin) associated with GC-like structures (p<4.710(-4), OR 0.45 and 0.41, respectively)."
18219,1914,"A haplotype of the two minor alleles was associated with GC status with p=2.610(-4), OR 0.40."
18220,1914,"Suggestive associations (p<0.01) were found in SNPs in the B cell activation and/or GC-formation related genes AICDA, BANK1 and BCL2."
18221,1914,"Furthermore, SNPs in IL17A, ICA1, PKN1 and SNPs in the NF-B pathway genes CARD8, IKBKE and TANK were found suggestively associated with GC-like structures."
18222,1914,"CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that genetic variations may explain why ectopic GC-like structures are present in some pSS patients, and support the hypothesis that GC+ and GC- patients represent distinct disease phenotypes."
18223,1915,Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been proven its value in adult patients with congestive heart failure of low ejection fraction and wide QRS duration.
18224,1915,"Contrast to adult patients, CRT has been rarely applied for young patients."
18225,1915,We report on a 9-yr-old boy with progressive left ventricular (LV) dilatation and dysfunction following chronic VVI pacemaker therapy for congenital complete atrioventricular block associated with maternal anti-SSA/Ro and SSB/La antibody.
18226,1915,His LV dysfunction was improved after epicardially established CRT.
18227,1916,Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas of the breast with mammary amyloidosis are exceedingly rare entities.
18228,1916,This report describes the case of women with long-standing Sjgren's syndrome presenting with breast MALT lymphoma and amylod light-chain (AL) amyloidosis.
18229,1916,Breast microcalcification needle biopsy made the positive diagnosis.
18230,1916,This unusual finding should be kept in mind.
18231,1916,It emphasises the need for careful clinical examination of nodes and extranodal organs supposedly affected in patients with autoimmune disease.
18232,1917,AIM: To study the influence of total glucosides of paeony (TGP) on the expression of peripheral blood programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
18233,1917,"METHOD: Ten patients with new-onset pSS were selected as the experimental group and were treated with 1.8 g of TGP (the main ingredient is Radix Paeoniae Alba) daily for 3 months; furthermore, 10 physically healthy individuals were selected as the control group."
18234,1917,"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, and flow cytometry was used to detect PD-1 expression on the surface of CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression on the surface of CD14+ monocytes and CD19+ B cells before and after treatment in the experimental and control groups."
18235,1917,"Furthermore, plasma levels of soluble PD-1 (sPD-1), interleukin (IL)-10, and IL-17A were also determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay."
18236,1917,RESULTS: The PD-1 expression on the surface of CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with pSS were significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.001).
18237,1917,"However, PD-L1 expression on the surface of CD14+ monocytes declined but not significantly (P > 0.05), and PD-L1 expression on the surface of CD19+ B cells increased significantly (P < 0.001)."
18238,1917,"Moreover, sPD-1 and IL-17A levels in the plasma of the experimental group were significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.001), but the IL-10 level was significantly lower than in the control group (P < 0.001)."
18239,1917,"After TGP treatment, PD-1 expression on the surface of CD4+ T and CD8+ lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with pSS had decreased significantly (P < 0.001); the PD-L1 expression on the surface of CD19+ cells had decreased significantly (P < 0.001); and the PD-L1 expression on the surface of CD14+ monocytes did not differ significantly (P > 0.05)."
18240,1917,"Furthermore, the levels of sPD-1 and IL-17A in plasma had decreased (P < 0.01) and IL-10 levels had increased after TGP treatment (P < 0.01)."
18241,1917,"CONCLUSION: PD-1/PD-L1 molecules expressed on the surface of T cells, B cells, and monokaryon participated in the pathogenesis and development of SS through interactions."
18242,1917,"Therefore, TGP, which may increase the expression of PD-1 and its relevant ligand PD-L1 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, may play a role in the pathogenesis and development of SS through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway by regulating regulatory T cells/T helper cell 17."
18243,1918,"Vasculitides comprise a heterogeneous group of autoimmune disorders, occurring as primary or secondary to a broad variety of systemic infectious, malignant or connective tissue diseases."
18244,1918,The latter occur more often but their pathogenic mechanisms have not been fully established.
18245,1918,Frequent and varied central and peripheral nervous system complications occur in vasculitides and connective tissue diseases.
18246,1918,"In many cases, the neurological disorders have an atypical clinical course or even an early onset, and the healthcare professionals should be aware of them."
18247,1918,"The purpose of this brief review was to give an update of the main neurological disorders of common vasculitis and connective tissue diseases, aiming at accurate diagnosis and management, with an emphasis on pathophysiologic mechanisms."
18248,1919,"PURPOSE: To investigate the expression of CXCL9, -10, -11, and CXCR3 in the tear film and ocular surface of patients with dry eye syndrome."
18249,1919,METHODS: Thirty-three patients with dry eye (16 with and 17 without Sjgren's syndrome) and 15 control subjects were recruited.
18250,1919,"The concentrations of CXCL9, -10, and -11 in tears were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays."
18251,1919,The correlation between chemokine levels and tear film and ocular surface parameters was analyzed.
18252,1919,"The expression of CXCL9, -10, -11, and CXCR3 in the conjunctiva was evaluated by using immunohistochemistry."
18253,1919,Flow cytometry was performed to count CXCR3(+) cells and CXCR3(+)CD4(+) cells in the conjunctiva.
18254,1919,"RESULTS: The concentrations of CXCL9, -10, and -11 were 1,148 +/- 1,088, 24,338 +/- 8,706, and 853 +/- 334 pg/mL, in the patients with dry eye, and 272 +/- 269 (P = 0.01), 18,149 +/- 5,266 (P = 0.02), and 486 +/- 175 (P < 0.01) pg/mL in the control subjects, respectively."
18255,1919,The concentrations significantly increased in tears of the patients with Sjgren's syndrome compared with those of the patients with non-Sjgren's dry eye (P < 0.05).
18256,1919,"CXCL10 levels correlated significantly with basal tear secretion, and CXCL11 levels correlated significantly with basal tear secretion, tear clearance rate, keratoepitheliopathy score, and goblet cell density (P < 0.05)."
18257,1919,"Staining for CXCL9, -10, -11, and CXCR3 increased in patients with dry eye, especially in the patients with Sjgren's syndrome."
18258,1919,Flow cytometry demonstrated an increased number of CXCR3(+) and CXCR3(+)CD4(+) cells in all the patients with dry eye.
18259,1919,"CONCLUSIONS: Expression of CXCL9, -10, -11, and CXCR3 increased in the tear film and ocular surface of patients with dry eye syndrome, especially in those with Sjgren's syndrome."
18260,1919,CXCL11 levels correlated significantly with various tear film and ocular surface parameters.
18261,1919,"(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00991679."
18262,1919,).
18263,1920,Production of autoantibodies is one of the main features of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
18264,1920,Long-lived plasma cells (PC) can produce autoantibodies for prolonged period of times without being affected by immunosuppressive therapies.
18265,1920,"As of today, little is known about the long-lived PC subset and their contribution to autoimmunity."
18266,1920,"We have characterized the phenotypic and migratory properties of peripheral blood PC isolated from pSS patients (grouped by focus score, FS) and compared them to PC from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and normal non-autoimmune subjects."
18267,1920,"We observed two populations of PC in all study groups, CD19+ PC and CD19- PC."
18268,1920,"Interestingly, the CD19- PC subset was most prominent in autoimmune patients (pSS and RA) compared to normal controls."
18269,1920,"Further investigation of the PC phenotype revealed that a high percentage of both CD19+ and CD19- PC isolated from pSS and RA patients did not express the CD27 marker, which is normally highly expressed on all types of PC."
18270,1920,"Differences in the expression of markers such as IgM, IgG, CD95 and CXCR3 in the group with high FS compared to FS = 1, underscore the heterogeneity of pSS patient group and demonstrate that phenotypic pattern of circulating PC associates with the severity of inflammation in the salivary glands of these patients."
18271,1920,"Our migration experiments show that addition of CXCL12 to PC in vitro, do not alter the migration potential of PC in any group tested."
18272,1920,"However, we observed an overall higher spontaneous migration of PC from pSS compared to both RA and normal controls."
18273,1921,Neonatal thrombosis is considered a rare manifestation with unclear aetiology.
18274,1921,"We reported a neonatal lupus of a Sjogren's syndrome mother with recurrent miscarriage secondary to antiphospholipid syndrome; seronegative to anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant and B2GP1."
18275,1921,"She was serologically positive to antiphosphatidylethanolamine and antiprothrombin antibodies, anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La."
18276,1921,"The neonate developed neonatal lupus complicated with right ventricular thrombus assumed to be induced by maternal transmission of antiphosphatidylethanolamine and antiprothrombin antibodies, treated successfully with tissue plasminogen activator and warfarin."
18277,1922,The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the interleukin (IL)-36 axis in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS).
18278,1922,Blood and minor labial salivary glands (MSG) biopsies were obtained from 35 pSS and 20 non-Sjgren's syndrome patients (nSS) patients.
18279,1922,Serum IL-36 was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
18280,1922,"IL-36, IL-36R, IL-36RA, IL-38, IL-22, IL-17, IL-23p19 and expression in MSGs was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and tissue IL-36 and IL-38 expression was also investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC)."
18281,1922,and  T cells and CD68(+) cells isolated from MSGs were also studied by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analysis.
18282,1922,IL-36 was over-expressed significantly in the serum and in the salivary glands of pSS.
18283,1922,"Salivary gland IL-36 expression was correlated with the expression levels of IL-17, IL-22 and IL-23p19."
18284,1922,"IL-38, that acts as inhibitor of IL-36, was also up-regulated in pSS."
18285,1922,(+) CD3(+) T cells and CD68(+) cells were the major source of IL-36 in minor salivary glands of pSS.
18286,1922,"T cells were not significantly expanded in the salivary glands of pSS but produced more IL-17, as their percentage correlated with the focus score."
18287,1922,Higher expression of IL-36 and IL-36R was also demonstrated in  T cells isolated from pSS compared to controls.
18288,1922,In this study we demonstrate that a significant increase in circulating and tissue levels of IL-36 occurs in pSS patients.
18289,1923,"OBJECTIVE: To report the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment of SS with belimumab, targeting the B-cell-activating factor."
18290,1923,"METHODS: Patients with primary SS were included in the BELISS open-label phase II study, a 1-year open-label trial, if they were positive for anti-SSA or anti-SSB antibodies and had systemic complications or persistent salivary gland enlargement or early disease or biomarkers of B-cell activation."
18291,1923,"They received belimumab, 10 mg/kg i.v., at weeks 0, 2 and 4 and then every 4 weeks; if response was observed at week 28, or if the clinician and the patient agreed to continue the study in the absence of side effects, treatment was continued for 1 year."
18292,1923,Efficacy and safety were analysed during the 1-year period of treatment.
18293,1923,"RESULTS: Among the 30 patients recruited, 28 were evaluated at week 28 as already reported."
18294,1923,"Nineteen terminated the 52-week study, 15 of them being responders and 4 non-responders at week 28."
18295,1923,Thirteen of the 15 responders at week 28 also responded at week 52 (86.7%).
18296,1923,"The improvement in the EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index and EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index scores observed at week 28 showed a trend to further improvement at week 52, and the amelioration of peculiar EULAR Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index domains (glandular, lymphadenopathy, articular) appeared of particular relevance."
18297,1923,"The decrease in biomarkers of B-cell activation observed at week 28 persisted unchanged until week 52, with RF decreasing further."
18298,1923,"Salivary flow, Schirmer's test and the focus score of salivary biopsy did not change."
18299,1923,Safety of treatment was good.
18300,1923,CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with belimumab may be beneficial in SS.
18301,1923,"Randomized, double-blind, controlled studies in larger populations are encouraged."
18302,1924,OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate if co-morbid conditions as hepatitis C virus infection and celiac disease may be associated to undifferentiated connective tissue disease.
18303,1924,"METHODS: We studied retrospectively and prospectively 52 patients with diagnosis of undifferentiated connective tissue disease, subdivided, according to Vaz criteria, in systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis and Sjgren's syndrome-like subgroups."
18304,1924,"Serological markers of celiac disease as anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were investigated."
18305,1924,An esophagogastroduodenoscopy with duodenal biopsy and histological examination was proposed to patients with positive celiac disease serology.
18306,1924,In addition antibodies directed to hepatitis C virus and total IgA-antibodies were investigated.
18307,1924,"RESULTS: Six patients (11,5%) were positive for celiac disease serological tests although two of them were asymptomatic."
18308,1924,"Four patients underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, showing total or subtotal villous atrophy at duodenal biopsies."
18309,1924,Hepatitis C virus serology was negative in all patients and none had IgA deficiency.
18310,1924,83% of celiac patients showed a scleroderma-like phenotype.
18311,1924,We observed a statistically higher incidence of autoimmune symptoms in patients with gluten sensitivity.
18312,1924,Fatigue and myalgia regressed early after the beginning of gluten-free diet.
18313,1924,CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of patients the prevalence of celiac disease was higher than that reported in the general population.
18314,1924,"We believe that all patients with diagnosis of undifferentiated connective tissue disease, especially those with a systemic sclerosis-like presentation, should be investigated for celiac disease, even in absence of gastrointestinal symptoms."
18315,1924,Gluten-free diet should be early recommended to all patients having undifferentiated connective tissue disease and gluten sensitivity.
18316,1925,The aim of this study was to elucidate more clearly the role of interleukin (IL)-18 in modulating the IL-22 pathway in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients and in pSS-associated lymphomas.
18317,1925,"Minor salivary glands (MSGs) from patients with pSS and non-specific chronic sialoadenitis (nSCS), parotid glands biopsies from non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) developed in pSS patients, were evaluated for IL-18, IL-22, IL-22 receptor 1 (IL-22R1), IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP) and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) expression."
18318,1925,"MSGs IL-22R1-expressing cells were characterized by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry in pSS, nSCS and healthy controls ."
18319,1925,The effect of recombinant IL-18 and IL-22 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from pSS and nSCS was studied by flow cytometry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
18320,1925,"MSGs of pSS and NHL were characterized by an imbalance between IL-22 and IL-22BP protein expression, with IL-18 and IL-22BP being expressed in a mutually exclusive manner and IL-18 and IL-22R1 being correlated directly."
18321,1925,"Aberrant expression of IL-22R1, induced by IL-18, was observed only among tissue and circulating myeloid cells of pSS patients and macrophages of NHL tissues of pSS patients, but not nSCS."
18322,1925,"IL-22R1 expression on PBMC of pSS was functional, as its stimulation with recombinant IL-22 significantly up-regulated the expression of STAT-3, IL-17 and IL-22."
18323,1925,An IL-18-dependent aberrant expression of IL-22R1 on cells of haematopoietic origin seems to be a specific immunological signature of patients with pSS and pSS-associated lymphomas.
18324,1926,Glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor family-related protein (GITR) is a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the TNFR superfamily.
18325,1926,"After activated by its ligand GITRL, GITR could influence the activity of effector and regulatory T cells, participating in the development of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases included rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune thyroid disease."
18326,1926,We previously reported that serum GITRL levels are increased in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients compared with healthy controls (HC).
18327,1926,"Here, we tested serum soluble GITR (sGITR) and GITRL levels in 41 primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients and 29 HC by ELISA and correlated sGITR and GITRL levels with clinical and laboratory variables."
18328,1926,GITR and GITRL expression in labial salivary glands was detected by immunohistochemistry.
18329,1926,pSS patients had significantly increased serum levels of sGITR and GITRL compared with controls (GITR: 5.66  3.56ng/mL versus 0.50  0.31ng/mL; P < 0.0001; GITRL: 6.17  7.10ng/mL versus 0.36  0.28ng/mL; P < 0.0001).
18330,1926,"Serum sGITR and GITRL levels were positively correlated with IgG (GITRL: r = 0.6084, P < 0.0001; sGITR: r = 0.6820, P < 0.0001) and ESR (GITRL: r = 0.8315, P < 0.0001; sGITR: r = 0.7448, P < 0.0001)."
18331,1926,"Moreover, GITR and GITRL are readily detected in the lymphocytic foci and periductal areas of the LSGs."
18332,1926,"In contrast, the LSGs of HC subjects did not express GITR or GITRL."
18333,1926,Our findings indicate the possible involvement of GITR-GITRL pathway in the pathogenesis of pSS.
18334,1926,Further studies may facilitate the development of targeting this molecule pathway for the treatment of pSS.
18335,1927,Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that particularly compromises the function of exocrine glands.
18336,1927,The pathogenetic mechanisms of this autoimmune exocrinopathy have not been fully elucidated.
18337,1927,"Since increasing evidence actually suggests that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway has a major impact on the inflammatory/immune reactions of the epithelial cells, in the apparent effort of enhancing innate immune defense while opposing overactivation of pro-inflammatory functions, the focus of the work presented here is clarify whether the EGFR-extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway plays a role in the pro-inflammatory responses mounted by pSS salivary gland epithelial cells (SGEC)."
18338,1927,Investigations revealed that the EGFR-mediated activation of the downstream effectors ERK1/2 in pSS SGEC appeared to require ADAM17-dependent release of the endogenous EGFR ligand amphiregulin and transactivation of the EGFR.
18339,1927,"Moreover, blockade of amphiregulin bioactivity using a neutralizing Ab significantly reduced EGFR transactivation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation."
18340,1927,"In addition, pSS SGEC treated with the specific ADAM17 inhibitor TAPI-1 and with the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 exhibited deactivated AREG/EGFR/ERK signaling pathway and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines released."
18341,1928,"Sensory neuronopathies or ganglionopathies, or dorsal root ganglion disorders, represent a subgroup of peripheral nervous system diseases, frequently associated with dysinmune or neoplastic disorders and with toxic agents."
18342,1928,A degeneration of both central and peripheral sensory proyections is present.
18343,1928,"Patients typically show early ataxia, loss of deep tendon reflexes and positive sensory symptoms present both in proximal and distal sites of the body."
18344,1928,We retrospectively studied 10 cases with a final diagnosis of sensory neuronopathy.
18345,1928,Sensory neuropathy was the presenting symptom and the course was subacute in all cases.
18346,1928,Paresthesias in upper limbs were a predominant manifestation (100%).
18347,1928,"Other manifestations included: hypoesthesia (10/10), gait ataxia (8/10), autonomic symptoms (3/10) and perioral paresthesias (3/10)."
18348,1928,"Electrophysiology showed sensory axonal neuronal pattern, with normal motor responses."
18349,1928,"Final diagnosis was acquired sensory neuronopathy in all patients, associated with Sjgren's syndrome in 2, with lupus erythematosus in 1, with rheumatoid arthritis in 1, with a cancer in 2 (paraneoplastic) and idiopathic in 4."
18350,1928,"In paraneoplastic cases, the tumor was small cell lung cancer in 1 (with positive anti-Hu antibodies), and epidermoid lung cancer in the other."
18351,1928,"Eight patients were treated with immunotherapy, high dose intravenous methylprednisolone and/or intravenous immunoglobulin; with poor response in 4 cases, neurologic improvement in 5, and without any change in 1 patient."
18352,1928,"The present work shows the typical clinical and electrophysiological pattern of subacute sensory neuronopathy, and the relevance of early treatment."
18353,1929,INTRODUCTION: Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has been known to promote bone healing by nonthermal effects.
18354,1929,"In recent studies, LIPUS has been shown to reduce inflammation in injured soft tissues."
18355,1929,Xerostomia is one of the most common symptoms in Sjgren syndrome (SS).
18356,1929,It is caused by a decrease in the quantity or quality of saliva.
18357,1929,The successful treatment of xerostomia is still difficult to achieve and often unsatisfactory.
18358,1929,The aim of this study is to clarify the therapeutic effects of LIPUS on xerostomia in SS.
18359,1929,METHODS: Human salivary gland acinar (NS-SV-AC) and ductal (NS-SV-DC) cells were cultured with or without tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-; 10 ng/ml) before LIPUS or sham exposure.
18360,1929,The pulsed ultrasound signal was transmitted at a frequency of 1.5 MHz or 3 MHz with a spatial average intensity of 30 mW/cm(2) and a pulse rate of 20 %.
18361,1929,"Cell number, net fluid secretion rate, and expression of aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and TNF- were subsequently analyzed."
18362,1929,Inhibitory effects of LIPUS on the nuclear factor B (NF-B) pathway were determined by Western blot analysis.
18363,1929,The effectiveness of LIPUS in recovering salivary secretion was also examined in a MRL/MpJ/lpr/lpr (MRL/lpr) mouse model of SS with autoimmune sialadenitis.
18364,1929,"RESULTS: TNF- stimulation of NS-SV-AC and NS-SV-DC cells resulted in a significant decrease in cell number and net fluid secretion rate (p < 0.01), whereas LIPUS treatment abolished them (p < 0.05)."
18365,1929,The expression changes of AQP5 and TNF- were also inhibited in LIPUS treatment by blocking the NF-B pathway.
18366,1929,"Furthermore, we found that mRNA expression of A20, a negative feedback regulator, was significantly increased by LIPUS treatment after TNF- or interleukin 1 stimulation (NS-SV-AC, p < 0.01; NS-SV-DC, p < 0.05)."
18367,1929,In vivo LIPUS exposure to MRL/lpr mice exhibited a significant increase in both salivary flow and AQP5 expression by reducing inflammation in salivary glands (p < 0.01).
18368,1929,CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that LIPUS upregulates expression of AQP5 and inhibits TNF- production.
18369,1929,"Thus, LIPUS may restore secretion by inflamed salivary glands."
18370,1929,It may synergistically activate negative feedback of NF-B signaling in response to inflammatory stimulation.
18371,1929,"Collectively, LIPUS might be a new strategic therapy for xerostomia in autoimmune sialadenitis with SS."
18372,1930,To further establish potential differences according to sex in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients from Southern Europe.
18373,1930,"We assessed clinical and epidemiological data of patients diagnosed with SLE according to the 1982 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria at the single hospital for a well-defined population of Northwest Spain, between 1987 and 2006."
18374,1930,Prevalence in December 2006 and age-standardized incidence rates in the whole period were estimated.
18375,1930,Kaplan-Meier method was used in order to estimate the probability of survivorship.
18376,1930,Women outnumbered men [127 (84.7%) vs. 23 (15.3%)].
18377,1930,The median age at the time of disease diagnosis in men was 54 years versus 43 in women (p < 0.001).
18378,1930,"Annual incidence rates were higher in women [5.9 (95% confidence interval--CI 4.9-7.0) per 100,000 population] than in men [1.1 (95% CI 0.7-1.7) per 100,000 population; p < 0.001]."
18379,1930,Raynaud's phenomenon was more common in women (40.9 vs. 3.0%; p = 0.01).
18380,1930,"While the frequency of secondary Sjgren's syndrome was increased in women (p = 0.02), renal disease at the time of diagnosis (39.1 vs. 15.0%; p < 0.01) and over the course of the disease was more common in men (43.5 vs. 24.4%; p = 0.06)."
18381,1930,Higher frequency of thrombocytopenia (39.1 vs. 16.5%; p = 0.01) and lower frequency of anti-SSA (13.0 vs. 31.5%; p = 0.08) and anti-SSB (0 vs. 17.7%; p = 0.03) were observed in men.
18382,1930,The 5- and 10-year survival probabilities were nonsignificantly reduced in men (91.3 and 78.3 3% vs. 94.6 and 89.2% in women).
18383,1930,The frequency of some clinical manifestations is different in men and women with SLE.
18384,1930,Higher awareness of these peculiarities may help to establish appropriate diagnosis and management of SLE in men.
18385,1931,The American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria for the classification of systemic sclerosis (SSc) were developed to classify more patients with SSc for studies and improve on previous criteria.
18386,1931,The new classification criteria have the following criteria: skin thickening of the fingers extending proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints.
18387,1931,"Seven additive items are each given a numerical weight: skin thickening, fingertip lesions, telangiectasia, abnormal nail fold capillaries, lung involvement, Raynaud's phenomenon, and SSc-related autoantibodies."
18388,1931,The ACR/EULAR classification criteria for SSc have good sensitivity and specificity but do not substitute for diagnostic criteria.
18389,1932,"Primary Sjgren's Syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease involving salivary and other exocrine glands that leads to progressive lymphocytic infiltration into the gland, tissue damage, and secretory defects."
18390,1932,The mechanism underlying this disease remains poorly understood.
18391,1932,"Here we report that mice with T-cell-targeted deletion of Stromal Interaction Molecule (STIM) 1 and STIM2 [double-knockout (DKO)] mice develop spontaneous and severe pSS-like autoimmune disease, displaying major hallmarks of the disease."
18392,1932,"In DKO mice, diffuse lymphocytic infiltration was seen in submandibular glands, a major target of pSS, by age 6 wk, progressing to severe inflammation by age 12 wk."
18393,1932,"Sjgren's syndrome-specific autoantibodies (SSA/Ro and SSB/La) were detected in the serum, and progressive salivary gland destruction and loss of fluid secretion were also seen."
18394,1932,"Importantly, we report that peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as lymphocytic infiltrates in submandibular glands from patients with pSS demonstrated significant reductions in STIM1 and STIM2 proteins."
18395,1932,Store-operated calcium entry was also reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from pSS patients compared with those from healthy controls.
18396,1932,"Thus, deficiency of STIM1 and STIM2 proteins in T cells, and consequent defects in Ca(2+) signaling, are associated with salivary gland autoimmunopathy in DKO mice and pSS patients."
18397,1932,These data reveal a previously unreported link between STIM1 and STIM2 proteins and pSS.
18398,1933,"Although the surfaces of both the skin and oral mucosa are protected by squamous epithelial cells and fall within the scope of dermatologic practice, the oral cavity contains highly specialized structures and functions distinct from other skin biology and pathologic conditions and are also the purview of clinicians who care for patients with skin and mucosal diseases."
18399,1933,"We describe the distinct features of the tongue, mucosa, and salivary glands."
18400,1933,"In particular, we examine the composition and function of the saliva, with special focus on salivary biomarkers."
18401,1933,"Within the oral cavity, saliva shows great promise as a noninvasive and sensitive marker for many systemic diseases."
18402,1933,"Biomarkers are being used as diagnostic or monitoring tools for a wide variety of diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjgren disease, Behet disease, and autoimmune blistering disorders, as well as premalignant and malignant lesions of the mouth."
18403,1934,"'Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease' is a new clinical concept of multi-organ diseases, with Mikulicz's disease (MD) being a clinical phenotype of IgG4-related disease."
18404,1934,"To clarify the clinical characteristics of respiratory involvement associated with IgG4-related MD, we retrospectively assessed 25 patients with MD, 11 (44%) of whom had allergic symptoms, and 7 (28%) of whom complained of respiratory problems."
18405,1934,"Thirteen patients (52%) presented with pulmonary and/or mediastinal lesions (P-MD) on chest computed tomography (CT), and 11 (44%) had lesions limited to the lacrimal and/or salivary glands (L-MD)."
18406,1934,"Mean serum total protein, IgG, and IgG4 concentrations were significantly higher and CH50 was significantly lower in the P-MD than in the L-MD group."
18407,1934,Immune complex was present only in the P-MD group.
18408,1934,"Chest CT images showed bronchial wall thickening, consolidation, nodule(s), interlobular thickening, ground glass opacity, pleural thickening/effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy."
18409,1934,"Five of seven patients who underwent histological examination of the lungs had abundant IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrates (IgG4/IgG-positive plasma cells >40%), but the other two did not."
18410,1934,"These findings suggest that respiratory lesions are not rare in patients with IgG4-related MD, and that they present with various manifestations."
18411,1934,"IgG4-related MD should be differentiated from similar diseases, such as sarcoidosis, bronchial asthma, Sjgren's syndrome, and malignant lymphoma."
18412,1935,RNA-binding nuclear antigens are a major class of self-antigen to which immune tolerance is lost in rheumatic diseases.
18413,1935,"Serological tolerance to one such antigen, La/Sjgren's syndrome (SS)-B (La), is controlled by CD4(+) T cells."
18414,1935,This study investigated peripheral tolerance to human La (hLa) by tracking the fate of hLa-specific CD4(+) T cells expressing the transgenic (Tg) 3B5.8 T cell receptor (TCR) after adoptive transfer into lymphocyte-replete recipient mice expressing hLa as a neo-self-antigen.
18415,1935,"After initial antigen-specific cell division, hLa-specific donor CD4(+) T cells expressed forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3)."
18416,1935,Donor cells retrieved from hLa Tg recipients displayed impaired proliferation and secreted interleukin (IL)-10 in vitro in response to antigenic stimulation.
18417,1935,Transfer of highly purified FoxP3-negative donor cells demonstrated that accumulation of hLa-specific regulatory T cells (Treg ) was due primarily to expansion of small numbers of donor Treg .
18418,1935,"Depletion of recipient plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), but not B cells, severely hampered the accumulation of FoxP3(+) donor Treg in hLa Tg recipients."
18419,1935,Recipient pDC expressed tolerogenic markers and higher levels of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules than B cells.
18420,1935,Adoptive transfer of hLa peptide-loaded pDC into mice lacking expression of hLa recapitulated the accumulation of hLa-specific Treg .
18421,1935,Blockade of the type 1 interferon (IFN) receptor in hLa Tg recipients of hLa-specific T cells impaired FoxP3(+) donor T cell accumulation.
18422,1935,"Therefore, peripheral expansion of Treg specific for an RNA-binding nuclear antigen is mediated by antigen-presenting pDC in a type 1 IFN-dependent manner."
18423,1935,These results reveal a regulatory function of pDC in controlling autoreactivity to RNA-binding nuclear antigens.
18424,1936,BACKGROUND: Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a primary autoimmune disease (pSS) or secondarily associated with other autoimmune diseases (sSS).
18425,1936,"The mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation in this syndrome remain unknown, and clinically it is difficult to diagnose owing to a lack of specific biomarkers."
18426,1936,METHODS: We extracted immunoglobulins (Igs) from the sera of patients with sSS associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and used them to screen a phage display library of peptides with random sequences.
18427,1936,"RESULTS: Our results show that an sSS-specific peptide, designated 3S-P, was recognized by sera of 68.2% (60 of 88) patients with sSS, 66.2% of patients with RA-sSS, and 76.5% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-sSS."
18428,1936,"The anti-3S-P antibody was scarcely found in patients with pSS (1.8%), RA (1.3%), SLE (4.2%), ankylosing spondylitis (0%), and gout (3.3%), as well as in healthy donors (2%)."
18429,1936,The 3S-P-binding Igs (antibodies) were used to identify antigens from salivary glands and synovial tissues from patients with sSS.
18430,1936,A putative target autoantigen expressed in the synovium and salivary gland recognized by anti-3S-P antibody was identified as self-vimentin.
18431,1936,"CONCLUSIONS: This novel autoantibody is highly specific in the diagnosis of sSS, and the underlying molecular mechanism of the disease might be epitope spreading involved with vimentin."
18432,1937,OBJECTIVES: To analyse the worldwide occurrence of sicca/Sjgren's (SS) syndrome associated with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in patients with cancer.
18433,1937,"METHODS: The ImmunoCancer International Registry (ICIR) is a Big Data-Sharing multidisciplinary network composed by 40 specialists in Rheumatology, Internal Medicine, Immunology and Oncology from 18 countries focused on the clinical and basic research of the immune-related adverse events (irAEs) related to cancer immunotherapies."
18434,1937,"For this study, patients who were investigated for a clinical suspicion of SS after being exposed to ICI were included."
18435,1937,"RESULTS: We identified 26 patients (11 women and 15 men, with a mean age at diagnosis of 63.57 years)."
18436,1937,"Underlying cancer included lung (n=12), renal (n=7), melanoma (n=4), and other (n=3) neoplasia."
18437,1937,Cancer immunotherapies consisted of monotherapy (77%) and combined regimens (23%).
18438,1937,"In those patients receiving monotherapy, all patients were treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (nivolumab in 9, pembrolizumab in 7 and durvalumab in 4); no cases associated with CTLA-4 inhibitors were identified."
18439,1937,"The main SS-related features consisted of dry mouth in 25 (96%) patients, dry eye in 17 (65%), abnormal ocular tests in 10/16 (62%) and abnormal oral diagnostic tests in 12/14 (86%) patients."
18440,1937,"Minor salivary gland biopsy was carried out in 15 patients: histopathological findings consisted of mild chronic sialadenitis in 8 (53%) patients and focal lymphocytic sialadenitis in the remaining 7 (47%); a focus score was measured in 5 of the 6 patients (mean of 1.8, range 1-4)."
18441,1937,"Immunological markers included positive ANA in 13/25 (52%), anti-Ro/ SS-A in 5/25 (20%), RF in 2/22 (9%), anti-La/SS-B in 2/25 (8%), low C3/C4 levels in 1/17 (6%) and positive cryoglobulins in 1/10 (10%)."
18442,1937,Classification criteria for SS were fulfilled by 10 (62%) out of 16 patients in whom the two key classificatory features were carried out.
18443,1937,"Among the 26 patients, there were only 3 (11%) who presented exclusively with sicca syndrome without organ-specific autoimmune manifestations."
18444,1937,"Therapeutic management included measures directed to treat sicca symptoms and therapies against autoimmune-mediated manifestations (glucocorticoids in 42%, second/third-line therapies in 31%); therapeutic response for systemic features was observed in 8/11 (73%)."
18445,1937,No patient died due to autoimmune involvement.
18446,1937,"CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Sjgren's syndrome triggered by ICI display a very specific profile different from that reported in idiopathic primary SS, including more frequent occurrence in men, a higher mean age, a predominant immunonegative serological profile, and a notable development of organ-specific autoimmune involvement in spite of the poor immunological profile."
18447,1937,The close association found between sicca/Sjgren's syndrome and primarily PD-1 blockade requires further specific investigation.
18448,1938,"The study was designed to describe demographic, clinical, serological, and radiological characteristics of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) followed-up by a single institution."
18449,1938,"One hundred sixty-five patients, diagnosed as RA using ACR classification criteria, and followed-up in the rheumatology clinic between December 2005 and January 2010, were enrolled in the study."
18450,1938,"Of the patients, 125 were female, and 40 were male."
18451,1938,"Mean age of the patients was 52.5years, and mean duration of the disease was 10.5years."
18452,1938,"The most frequently involved joints were the wrist (95.2%), MCP (90.9%), and the PIP (92.6%)."
18453,1938,"The knee and hip joint involvement rates were 44.8% and 23.6%, respectively."
18454,1938,Patients (50.9%) were detected to have tenosynovitis.
18455,1938,Involvement of the elbow joint was shown in 10.9% of the patients.
18456,1938,"The most common extra-articular manifestations were sicca symptom (40.6%) and carpal tunnel syndrome (35.7%), followed by pulmonary involvement (6.6%), vasculitis (3.6%), and Raynaud's phenomenon (1.2%)."
18457,1938,Rheumatoid nodules were detected in six patients (3.6%).
18458,1938,"One patient had Felty syndrome, and another patient had secondary amyloidosis."
18459,1938,"Patients (90.3%) had positive rheumatoid factor (RF), and 124 patients had positive anti-CCP antibody (75.2%)."
18460,1938,"A more severe clinical course and a higher incidence of erosion, tenosynovitis, and deformities were detected in patients with anti-CCP antibody and positive RF (p=0.03, p=0.04, p=0.01, p=0.04, respectively)."
18461,1938,"The wrist was the most frequently involved joint in our patients, and the most frequently seen extra-articular manifestation was sicca symptom."
18462,1938,Presence of RF and anti-CCP antibody was associated with more severe disease including erosive and destructive arthropathy.
18463,1938,Extra-articular involvement and presence of accompanying diseases increase the mortality.
18464,1939,BACKGROUNDS: Nummular headache (NH) is currently considered a form of peripheral neuralgia originating from the terminal branch in epicranial tissue but its etiopathogenesis is still unknown.
18465,1939,"Since autoimmune disorders often involve the trigeminosensory nerve to provoke craniofacial pain, we hypothesize that autoimmunity aberration may play a role with regard to NH."
18466,1939,"METHODS: We examined the antibodies to antinuclear factor, ds-DNA, extracted nuclear antigens, rheumatoid factor, as well as antiphospholipid antibodies, in 23 primary NH patients."
18467,1939,"RESULTS: Among them were 16 patients (69.6%) found as having at least one abnormal autoimmune index, namely, antibodies to antinuclear factor in 8 patients, SSA/La in 6 patients, rheumatoid factor in 4 patients, SSB/Ro in 2 patients, and ds-DNA in 1 patient."
18468,1939,"An abnormal increase of blood anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibody was noted in 4 patients and lupus anticoagulant in 1 patient, whereas HLA-B27 seropositivity was detected in 1 patient."
18469,1939,"Except for 2 patients positive for antinuclear factor without other associated features, 15 patients (65%) were finally diagnosed as having Sjogren/sicca syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome."
18470,1939,"CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of abnormal autoimmune indices and disorders is present in primary NH patients, suggesting a probable relationship between autoimmunity aberration and epicranial neuralgia in NH."
18471,1940,OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of the multifunctional protein semaphorin 5A (Sema5A) in modulating cellular immune responses and as a biomarker in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
18472,1940,METHODS: A soluble form of recombinant Sema5A was used to assess its effect on the functions of primary T cells and natural killer (NK) cells isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors.
18473,1940,Cell proliferation and expression of transcription factors were determined by flow cytometry.
18474,1940,Cytokine secretion was analyzed using Luminex technology.
18475,1940,"Serum samples obtained from 145 patients with RA and control serum samples obtained from healthy individuals or patients with non-RA rheumatic diseases were analyzed for the presence of secreted Sema5A, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblotting."
18476,1940,RESULTS: Soluble Sema5A strongly increased T cell and NK cell proliferation and induced the secretion of proinflammatory Th1/Th17 cytokines.
18477,1940,"Accordingly, Sema5A stimulation caused significant up-regulation of T-bet and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor t levels in T cells."
18478,1940,"In addition, significantly elevated levels of secreted Sema5A were detected in the serum of patients with RA compared with control serum."
18479,1940,Sema5A levels were highest in patients with RA who were positive for the RA biomarker anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (P < 0.001 versus patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and patients with Sjgren's syndrome) and correlated with the levels of rheumatoid factor.
18480,1940,"CONCLUSION: Soluble Sema5A is a potent activator of T cells and NK cells in vitro, and high serum levels of Sema5A are associated with RA."
18481,1940,"Taken together, the results indicate that Sema5A contributes to the pathogenesis of RA through antigen-independent T cell and NK cell activation."
18482,1940,"Hence, Sema5A is a promising complementary biomarker for the diagnosis of RA."
18483,1941,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical and laboratory differences between cryoglobulinaemic and hypergammaglobulinaemic purpura in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), in a large Italian multicentre cohort."
18484,1941,"METHOD: Patients were selected according to the following criteria: fulfilling the American-European classification criteria for pSS, serum cryoglobulin and gammaglobulin levels evaluated, and lack of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection."
18485,1941,"Multinomial analyses were performed by distinguishing three groups of pSS: (i) purpura associated with cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis (CV), (ii) purpura associated with hypergammaglobulinaemic vasculitis (HGV), and (iii) pSS patients without purpura (pSS controls)."
18486,1941,Patients with purpura but without cryoglobulins or hypergammaglobulinaemia were excluded.
18487,1941,RESULTS: A total of 652 patients were enrolled in this study.
18488,1941,"Group 1/CV comprised 23/652 patients (3.53%), group 2/HGV 40/652 patients (6.13%), and group 3/pSS controls 589/652 (90.34%)."
18489,1941,"The three groups were found to be significantly different from each other (post-estimation test: group 1/CV vs. group 3/pSS controls: p < 0.0001; group 1/CV vs. group 2/HGV: p = 0.0001; group 2/HGV vs. group 3/pSS controls: p = 0.0003), thus confirming the different phenotypes of purpura in pSS.Multivariate analyses revealed that peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.001), low C4 (p < 0.001), leucopaenia (p = 0.01), serum monoclonal component (p = 0.02), and the presence of anti-SSB/La antibodies (p = 0.02) characterized CV whereas rheumatoid factor (p = 0.001), leucopaenia (p = 0.01), serum monoclonal component (p = 0.01), and anti-SSA/Ro antibodies (p = 0.049) were significantly associated with HGV."
18490,1941,Lymphoma was associated only with CV.
18491,1941,"CONCLUSIONS: HGV is a cutaneous vasculitis, related to a benign B-cell proliferation, whereas CV is a systemic immune complex-mediated vasculitis with complement activation and a higher risk of lymphoma, thus confirming CV but not HGV as a prelymphomatous condition in pSS."
18492,1942,"OBJECTIVES: To study surface expression of P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), and its correlation with anxiety and/or depression."
18493,1942,METHODS: The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) were used to assess 31 patients with pSS.
18494,1942,"P2X7R expression on the surface of CD14+ and CD14- PBMC, with or without ATP stimulation, was measured by flow cytometry."
18495,1942,IL-1 and IL-6 levels in blood plasma and supernatant after ATP stimulation were measured by ELISA.
18496,1942,"Nineteen patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 18 patients with anxiety and/or depression, and 20 healthy cases were used as controls."
18497,1942,RESULTS: P2X7R expression was detected in all subjects.
18498,1942,"Compared with no ATP stimulation, significant up-regulation of P2X7R expression on CD14+ PBMC was observed after ATP stimulation in the pSS group only (p=0.001), while on CD14- PBMC there was significant up-regulation in both the pSS (p<0.001) and anxiety/depression (p=0.003) groups."
18499,1942,"After ATP stimulation, P2X7R expression on CD14+ PBMC in the pSS group was significantly higher than the RA group (p=0.044), anxiety/depression group (p=0.004) and healthy controls (p=0.002)."
18500,1942,"Moreover, in the pSS group, P2X7R expression on CD14+ PBMC was significantly positively correlated to IL-1 supernatant levels (r=0.447, p=0.025)."
18501,1942,"Overall, there were 45.2% (14/31) patients with anxiety and 32.3% (10/31) with depression, in the pSS group."
18502,1942,"P2X7R expression on CD14- PBMC was significantly positively correlated to scores of anxiety (r=0.344, p=0.030) and depression (r=0.319, p=0.045)."
18503,1942,"CONCLUSIONS: Surface expression of P2X7R on PBMC in patients with pSS was significantly higher than controls, suggesting P2X7R may contribute to the complex pathogenesis of pSS and also anxiety and/or depression."
18504,1943,"This article examines the differences and interaction between sex and gender, and how they affect women's oral and general health."
18505,1943,"The authors provide a definition of women's health, and examples of how this definition can be used to describe various oral health conditions and diseases in women."
18506,1943,The article reviews the research on sex and gender and provides examples of their interactions.
18507,1943,Examples of oral diseases that affect primarily women are reviewed.
18508,1943,"Advice for clinicians on the diagnosis, management, and prevention of these conditions is provided."
18509,1944,Vasculitides secondary to connective tissue diseases are classified under the category of 'vasculitis associated with systemic disease' in the revised International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) nomenclature.
18510,1944,"These secondary vasculitides may affect any of the small, medium or large vessels and usually portend a poor prognosis."
18511,1944,Any organ system can be involved and the presentation would vary depending upon that involvement.
18512,1944,Treatment depends upon the type and severity of presentation.
18513,1944,"In this review, we describe secondary vasculitis associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, relapsing polychondritis, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome and idiopathic inflammatory myositis, focusing mainly on recent advances in the past 3years."
18514,1945,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of oral candidiasis and multiple oral Candida infections in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS), and the clinical and drug susceptibility profile."
18515,1945,METHODS: Thirty patients with primary SS were enrolled in our study.
18516,1945,"The diagnosis of oral candidiasis was based on the clinical manifestation, and confirmed by a concentrated rinse culture."
18517,1945,Candida spp.
18518,1945,"assessment was accomplished using standard methods: Sabouraud dextrose agar with 50 mg/l chloramphenicol and CHROMagar were used for the rapid screening of clinical species, followed by the API 20C system for further species identification."
18519,1945,In vitro antifungal drug susceptibility of Candida isolates was determined by the minimal inhibitory concentrations.
18520,1945,"RESULTS: In our study, 87% (26/30) of subjects had oral candidiasis, in which 42% (11/26) had multiple Candida spp."
18521,1945,infection.
18522,1945,"Although C. albicans remains the predominant isolate, other rare species such as C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. krusei were present, alone or in combination."
18523,1945,Chronic atrophic candidiasis is the most common clinical type of oral candidiasis in patients with SS.
18524,1945,The susceptibilities of the 44 Candida isolates to 7 antifungal agents varied dramatically.
18525,1945,"The resistance to azoles was remarkable, and the phenomenon of cross-resistance between itraconazole and fluconazole was observed."
18526,1945,CONCLUSION: Patients with primary SS carry a high risk of oral candidiasis and a high frequency of multiple Candida infections.
18527,1945,The azole resistance patterns of Candida spp.
18528,1945,support the necessity for drug susceptibility testing as a routine procedure for patients with oral Candida infections.
18529,1946,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease with exocrine glands disorder.
18530,1946,Our previous work demonstrated the protective effect of Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides (DP) both on the phenotypes of patients and animal model with SS.
18531,1946,"In this study, we expand these observations to explore the possible mechanisms."
18532,1946,The experimental SS mice model was established with or without the administration of DP (20mg/ml).
18533,1946,"The time frame of lymphocytes infiltration, apoptotic indicators such as Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were determined in submandibular gland (SG), as well as the subsequent mRNA expression of cytokines such as TNF-, IL-1 beta and IL-6."
18534,1946,The expression and localization of aquaporin-5 (AQP-5) was examined by Western blot and immunofluorescent staining.
18535,1946,"As the result, DP could suppress the progressive lymphocytes infiltration and apoptosis, and balance the chaos of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the SG."
18536,1946,"Further, DP ameliorated the abnormalities of AQP-5 and maintained its functional importance of saliva secretion."
18537,1946,"In addition, the protection of AQP-5 by DP from human TNF- was supported by an in vitro study on A-253 cell line."
18538,1946,Our study further supported the efficacy of DP as the promising candidate for the therapy of SS.
18539,1947,"AIMS: The clinical significance of myeloperoxidase (MPO) has been the focus of investigation because it may contribute to the chronic, non-microbial inflammatory process in various diseases."
18540,1947,"Here, we determined serum MPO levels in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, and investigated the associations between MPO levels and disease activity indicators in RA."
18541,1947,"MAIN METHODS: The distribution of MPO was determined in serum samples from patients with RA, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS), dermatomyositis (DM), or ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and from healthy controls using commercial ELISA kits."
18542,1947,Associations of serum MPO levels with the disease variables of RA patients were evaluated.
18543,1947,KEY FINDINGS: All patient samples analyzed showed higher serum levels of MPO than healthy controls.
18544,1947,"Furthermore, MPO levels in RA were significantly higher than those in the other diseases with the exception of DM."
18545,1947,"Higher MPO levels were observed in RA patients with increased C-reactive protein (p=0.005) or neutrophil percentage (p<0.001), as well as in those with highly active disease (p<0.001)."
18546,1947,"Moderate positive correlations between MPO levels and IgM (r=0.334, p=0.001), C-reactive protein (r=0.293, p=0.003), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r=0.240, p=0.016), or DAS28 (r=0.350, p<0.001) were also demonstrated."
18547,1947,SIGNIFICANCE: The MPO concentration is likely to increase in patients with chronic inflammation.
18548,1947,The associations between MPO and the disease variables of RA patients support a role for MPO in the inflammatory process of the disease.
18549,1948,To investigate the risks of overactive bladder (OAB) and bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC) in primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients.
18550,1948,"A nationwide, population-based cohort study was conducted using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database."
18551,1948,"From 2001 to 2010, participants with newly diagnosed pSS were recognized as the study group."
18552,1948,"In addition, a comparison cohort of non-pSS participants was matched for age, gender, and initial diagnosis date."
18553,1948,"Risks of developing OAB and BPS/IC in pSS patients of different age, sex, and various therapeutic strategies were calculated."
18554,1948,Hazard ratios (HR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) were analyzed by Cox proportional hazard model.
18555,1948,"In total, 11,526 pSS patients were recognized."
18556,1948,The HRs of OAB and BPS/IC in pSS patients were 1.68 (95% C.I.
18557,1948,": 1.48-1.91, p<0.01) and 2.34 (95% C.I."
18558,1948,": 1.59-3.44, p<0.01), respectively."
18559,1948,"The risks of OAB and BPS/IC were significantly increased for pSS patients aged < 65 years (HR: 1.73 and 2.67), female patients (HR: 1.74 and 2.34), and patients requiring treatment for dry eyes and dry mouth (HR: 2.06 and 2.93)."
18560,1948,pSS patients exhibited an increased risk of OAB and BPS/IC.
18561,1948,"Female gender, younger age, and severe glandular dysfunction requiring treatments were potential risk factors."
18562,1949,Objective: To explore the clinical features and conduct prognostic analysis about visual recovery and relapse of neuromyelitisoptica (NMO) spectrum disease (NMOSD) with sjogren syndrome (SS).
18563,1949,"Methods: A retrospective and prospective observational study was conducted.Between July 2013 and June 2016, 172 patients with NMOSD (NMOSD-non SS: 116/172, 67.4%; NMOSD-SS: 56/172, 32.6%) were assessed at Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.The prognostic factors of NMOSD-SS patients were also analyzed."
18564,1949,"Results: As compared with NMOSD-non SS patients, NMOSD-SS patients had worse visual impairment (percentage of patients with visual acuity less than 0.1, 83.9% vs 69.8%, P<0.05), higher positive rate of SSA (92.9% vs 0.0%, P<0.05), higher proportion of dryness of mouth and eye (66.1% vs 5.2%, P<0.05) as well as higher percentage of reduced visual evoked potential (VEP) amplitude (60.7% vs 43.1%, P<0.05)."
18565,1949,"NMOSD-SS patients had a significantly higher average year recurrent frequency (0.58 vs 0.53) and significantly shorter mean recurrence time (6.7 months vs 12.4 months, P<0.05)."
18566,1949,"The results showed that recurrent eyes, the worst visual acuities of onset less than 0.1 were independent risk factors of visual impairment (visual activity <0.1), according to at least six months' follow-up of all NMOSD-SS patients (OR=6.410 and 9.434, respectively, P<0.05)."
18567,1949,"Meanwhile, immunosuppressive drugs were protective factors of relapse in NMOSD-SS patients (OR=0.107, P<0.05)."
18568,1949,"Conclusions: NMOSD-SS patients have worse visual impairment, and they are more vulnerable to relapse than NMOSD-non SS patients, and the vision is lack of recovery for NMOSD-SS with recurrent eyes or the worst vision of onset less than 0.1.Immunosuppressive drugs can reduce the recurrence of NMOSD-SS relapse."
18569,1950,"OBJECTIVE: To describe how systemic disease is treated in a large cohort of Spanish patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) in daily practice, focusing on the adequacy of therapies for the level of systemic activity measured by ESSDAI score."
18570,1950,"PATIENTS AND METHODS: By December 2014, our database included 1120 consecutive patients who fulfilled the 2002 classification criteria for SS."
18571,1950,"Therapeutic schedules were classified into 4 categories: no systemic therapies, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and/or low dose glucocorticoids (GCS) (<20mg/day), high dose GCS (>20mg/day) and use of second-line therapies (immunosuppressive agents, intravenous immunoglobulins [IVIG] and/or rituximab [RTX])."
18572,1950,"RESULTS: There were 1048 (94%) women and 72 (6%) men , with a mean age at diagnosis of 54 years."
18573,1950,"The main drug-based therapeutic approaches for systemic pSS during follow-up were HCQ in 282 (25%) patients, GCS in 475 (42%, at doses >20mg/day in 255-23%), immunosuppressive agents in 148 (13%), IVIG in 25 (2%) and RTX in 35 (3%) patients."
18574,1950,"HCQ was associated with a lower risk of death (adjusted HR of 0.57, 95% 0.34-0.95)."
18575,1950,"We classified 16 (7%) of the 255 patients treated with >20mg GCS and 21/148 (14%) treated with immunosuppressive agents as patients inadequately treated, mainly associated with articular involvement of low/moderate activity."
18576,1950,"CONCLUSION: The management of pSS should be organ-specific, using low dose GCS in patients with moderate systemic activity, limiting the use of high dose GCS and second-line therapies to refractory or potentially severe scenarios."
18577,1950,"The use of systemic therapies for dryness, chronic pain or fatigue is not warranted."
18578,1951,OBJECTIVE: The relevance of the Th17 pathway in primary SS (pSS) is unclear.
18579,1951,Published studies have relied on restimulating circulating CD161(+) T cells in vitro for quantitation of IL-17-producing cells.
18580,1951,"While CD161 marks all IL-17(+) T cells, it is also expressed by other Th subsets."
18581,1951,The aim of this study was to directly analyse retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor (ROR)- expressing and non-expressing subsets of CD161(+) T cells to determine the relevance of the Th17 pathway in pSS.
18582,1951,METHODS: We quantitated the frequencies of both CD161(-) and ROR-expressing T cells by comparative flow cytometry in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a well-stratified cohort of pSS patients and control subjects.
18583,1951,We also analysed the expression of antigen D-related HLA (HLA-DR) and CD161 in labial salivary glands from nine subjects undergoing a diagnostic biopsy.
18584,1951,"RESULTS: While the frequencies of both ROR(+) and ROR(-) subsets of CD161(+) CD4(+) T cells were increased in peripheral blood from pSS patients, the increase in the ROR(+) subset positively correlated with humoral manifestations of the disease (anti-SSA/SSB autoantibodies and hypergammaglobulinaemia), but not with disease activity, and vice versa for the ROR(-) subset."
18585,1951,"An increased frequency of HLA-DR(+) CD161(+)CD4(+) T cells was observed in labial salivary gland biopsies from pSS patients, suggesting chronic activation of CD161(+)CD4(+) T cells in the target tissue of the disease."
18586,1951,"CONCLUSION: In addition to pointing to CD161 as a marker of a pathogenic subset of CD4(+) T cells in pSS patients, our data indicate that even though the ROR(+) (Th17) CD161(+) subset might contribute to humoral manifestations of the disease, the ROR(-) (non-Th17) CD161(+) subset is the one associated with disease activity in pSS patients."
18587,1952,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous nodular amyloidosis is rare, and association with Sjgren's syndrome has been reported."
18588,1952,We discuss the possible link between these two diseases based on a case we saw.
18589,1952,PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 78-year-old woman with Sjgren's syndrome ongoing for 17 years presented for evaluation of a waxy infiltrated lesion on her left leg that had appeared 6 months earlier.
18590,1952,Histopathological examination revealed a deposit of homogenous eosinophilic material throughout the dermis consistent with amyloidosis.
18591,1952,Immunohistochemical study showed these deposits to be AL immunoglobin light chains.
18592,1952,DISCUSSION: The association of cutaneous nodular amyloidosis and Sjgren's syndrome appears to be a distinct disease entity reflecting the polymorphic clinical spectrum of lymphoproliferative diseases related to Sjgren's syndrome.
18593,1953,INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic vaccination with antigen-specific tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDC) might become a future option of individualized therapy for patients with autoimmune diseases.
18594,1953,"In this study, we tested the possibility of generating monocyte-derived tolDC from patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS)."
18595,1953,"We analyzed phenotype, cytokine production and ability to suppress Ro/La-specific immune responses."
18596,1953,"METHODS: Monocyte-derived tolDC from patients with pSS were generated in the presence of dexamethasone, vitamin D3 and lipopolysaccharide (DexVD3 DC)."
18597,1953,The phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry and the cytokine profile was investigated using a 25-plex Luminex assay and ELISA.
18598,1953,The capacity to both stimulate Ro/La-specific T cells and suppress this response was evaluated by autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR).
18599,1953,RESULTS: DC generated from patients with pSS had a similar phenotype and cytokine profile to those from healthy controls.
18600,1953,"DexVD3 DC from pSS patients induced little antigen-specific T cell proliferation, but DexVD3 DC-primed lymphocytes successfully suppressed Ro/La-specific T cell responses."
18601,1953,CONCLUSIONS: DexVD3 DC presenting Ro/La antigens might be a promising new therapeutic option for patients with pSS.
18602,1954,Autoimmune-rheumatological diseases are worldwide distributed disorders and represent a complex array of illnesses characterized by autoreactivity (reactivity against self-antigens) of T-B lymphocytes and by the synthesis of autoantibodies crucial for diagnosis (biomarkers).
18603,1954,"Yet, the effects of the autoimmune chronic inflammation on the infiltrated tissues and organs generally lead to profound tissue and organ damage with loss of function (i.e., lung, kidney, joints, exocrine glands)."
18604,1954,"Although progresses have been made on the knowledge of these disorders, much still remains to be investigated on their pathogenesis and identification of new biomarkers useful in clinical practice."
18605,1954,"The rationale of using proteomics in autoimmune-rheumatological diseases has been the unmet need to collect, from biological fluids that are easily obtainable, a summary of the final biochemical events that represent the effects of the interplay between immune cells, mesenchymal cells and endothelial cells."
18606,1954,"Proteomic analysis of these fluids shows encouraging results and in this review, we addressed four major autoimmune-rheumatological diseases investigated through proteomic techniques and provide evidence-based data on the highlights obtained in systemic sclerosis, primary and secondary Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis."
18607,1955,"PURPOSE: To explore the relationship of serum concentrations of osteopontin(OPN), TNF- and TGF-1 in Sjoigren's syndrome patients."
18608,1955,"METHODS: Forty Sjoigren's syndrome (SS) patients were determined by pathological examination, which included 15 primary SS and 25 secondary SS."
18609,1955,"Serum level of OPN, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 were examined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)."
18610,1955,Multiple correlation analysis was performed using SPSS13.0 software package.
18611,1955,"RESULTS: Serum OPN, TNF-alpha levels increased in SS compared with healthy subjects (P<0.05).Serum TGF-beta 1 level in secondary SS significantly increased than primary SS (P<0.05)."
18612,1955,"On the contrary, serum TGF-beta1 level had no significant change compared with the controls."
18613,1955,OPN was correlated with TGF-beta 1.
18614,1955,CONCLUSIONS: OPN and TNF-alpha may be used as adjunctive diagnostic parameter.
18615,1955,TGF-beta 1 can be used as an index in differential diagnosis of primary and secondary SS.
18616,1955,"OPN and TGF-beta 1 have different effects and interactions between them, demonstrating mutuality, diversity and integrity of the cytokine network."
18617,1956,"Primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease characterised by lymphocytic infiltrations in the exocrine glands, resulting in destruction of salivary and lacrimal glands."
18618,1956,"B cells have an important role in the disease, as detection of autoantibodies against SSA/Ro or SSB/La is one of the diagnostic criteria, being found in a majority of the patients."
18619,1956,Toll-like receptors (TLR) are pattern recognition receptors.
18620,1956,TLR-7 and -9 are found in endosomes and bind microbial nucleic acids.
18621,1956,We have previously shown that pSS patients and healthy controls have similar expression pattern of TLR-7 and -9 in various B-cell populations.
18622,1956,In this study we further analysed the responsiveness of B cells upon TLR stimulation.
18623,1956,B cells isolated from peripheral blood of 21 pSS patients and 18 healthy controls were stimulated with TLR-7 and -9 ligands for 24 h before being analysed for the expression of certain surface markers and intracellular cytokine levels by flow cytometry.
18624,1956,Secreted cytokines were measured by a multiplex cytokine assay.
18625,1956,Patients with pSS had more nave and less preswitched memory B cells compared to controls in unstimulated as well as via TLR-7 stimulated cells.
18626,1956,Unstimulated and via TLR-7 stimulated B cells from pSS patients also had fewer IL-10(+) preswitched memory B cells.
18627,1956,"Moreover, TLR-7 and -9 stimulated B cells of pSS patients secreted increased amounts of several cytokines."
18628,1956,B cells of pSS patients show a different responsiveness upon stimulation of TLR-7 and -9 compared to controls.
18629,1957,Immunoglobulin G4-related sialadenitis (IgG4-RS) is a newly recognized immune-mediated disease and one of immunoglobulin G4-related diseases (IgG4-RD).
18630,1957,Our multidisciplinary research group investigated the clinicopathological characteristics and diagnosis of IgG4-RS during the past 10 years.
18631,1957,"Clinically, it showed multiple bilateral enlargement of major salivary glands (including sublingual and accessory parotid glands) and lacrimal glands."
18632,1957,"The comorbid diseases of head and neck region including rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and lymphadenopathy were commonly seen, which could occur more early than enlargement of major salivary glands."
18633,1957,"Internal organ involvements, such as autoimmune pancreatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, and interstitial pneumonia could also be seen."
18634,1957,Thirty-five (38.5%) patients had the symptom of xerostomia.
18635,1957,Saliva flow at rest was lower than normal.
18636,1957,Secretory function was reduced more severely in the submandibular glands than in the parotid glands.
18637,1957,Serum levels of IgG4 were elevated in almost all the cases and the majority of the patients had increased IgE levels.
18638,1957,"CT, ultrasonography, and sialography showed their imaging characteristics."
18639,1957,"Histologically it showed marked lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, large irregular lymphoid follicles with expanded germinal centers, prominent cellular interlobular fibrosis, eosinophil infiltration, and obliterative phlebitis."
18640,1957,Their immunohistological examination showed marked IgG-positive and IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration and high IgG4/IgG ratio.
18641,1957,The disease could be divided into three stages according to severity of glandular fibrosis.
18642,1957,The serum IgG4 level was higher and the saliva secretion lower as glandular fibrosis increased.
18643,1957,"IgG4-RS should be differentiated from other diseases with enlargement of major salivary gland and lacrimal gland, such as primary Sjgren syndrome, chronic obstructive submandibular sialadenitis, and eosinophilic hyperplastic lymphogranuloma."
18644,1958,OBJECTIVE: Laminin alpha1-chain normally induces intercalated duct progenitors to differentiate to acinar cells through integrin (INT) alpha1ss1 and alpha2ss1 receptors.
18645,1958,"Maintenance of acinar cells is impaired in Sjgren's syndrome (SS), which is also characterized by low levels of serum and salivary androgens."
18646,1958,We hypothesized that androgens normally support salivary gland remodeling by upregulating either laminin alpha1 chain or its cellular alpha1 or alpha2 INT subunit-containing receptors.
18647,1958,METHODS: Intercalated duct and acinar human salivary gland (HSG) cells and labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsies from healthy controls and patients with SS were cultured without or with sex steroids.
18648,1958,Laminin alpha1 chain and INT alpha1 and alpha2 subunits were studied using quantitative reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction and INT alpha1 and alpha2 subunits using immunofluorescence staining.
18649,1958,RESULTS: INT alpha1-subunit and alpha2-subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were increased in intercalated duct and acinar cells by DHEA and testosterone.
18650,1958,"In contrast, laminin alpha1-chain mRNA levels were not affected."
18651,1958,The upregulating effect of DHEA on INT subunits was also seen at the protein level.
18652,1958,DHEA also increased mRNA levels of both INT subunits in healthy but not SS LSG.
18653,1958,"CONCLUSION: Androgens increased INT alpha1 and alpha2 subunits in tubuloepithelial cells and in healthy LSG, but in SS salivary glands this androgen regulation was defective, which is likely to contribute to defective outside-in signaling, acinar atrophy, and ductal cell hyperplasia."
18654,1959,OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and investigate the clinical features and the outcome of clinically significant renal involvement in a large cohort of patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
18655,1959,"METHODS: Among 715 patients who met the American-European Consensus Group criteria for primary SS, those with clinically significant renal involvement were identified and their clinical and immunologic features were recorded."
18656,1959,"The prognosis in patients with primary SS with renal involvement was assessed by the clinical appearance of any of the following major outcomes: death, hemodialysis, chronic renal failure (CRF), and lymphoma."
18657,1959,Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied to compare death rates between patients without and those with renal involvement.
18658,1959,"RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with primary SS (4.9%) had clinically significant renal involvement, representing a total followup time after renal diagnosis of 252.2 person-years."
18659,1959,"Thirteen patients (37.1%) had interstitial nephritis alone, 17 patients (48.6%) had glomerulonephritis (GN) alone, and 5 patients (14.3%) had both entities."
18660,1959,"Nine patients died (25.7%), 11 developed CRF (including 4 requiring chronic hemodialysis) (31.4%), and 9 developed lymphoma (25.7%)."
18661,1959,The overall 5-year survival rate was 85%.
18662,1959,"Kaplan-Meier analysis showed statistically significant reduced survival for patients with primary SS with renal involvement compared to those without renal involvement (P < 0.0001 by log rank test), with GN patients displaying increased mortality."
18663,1959,Eight of 9 reported deaths (89%) and 8 of 9 lymphomas (89%) were observed among patients with GN.
18664,1959,CONCLUSION: The long-term prognosis varies for patients with primary SS who have clinically significant renal involvement.
18665,1959,"Patients with interstitial nephritis display a favorable prognosis, while patients with GN are at high risk of developing lymphoma and have poor survival."
18666,1960,OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of patients referred for gold therapy and determine the reason for referral.
18667,1960,"METHODS: We conducted a chart review of patients referred for gold at the Mary Pack Arthritis Program, Vancouver, Canada, from July 2007 to July 2009."
18668,1960,RESULTS: The sample included 69 female and 12 male patients.
18669,1960,"Diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 71/81, psoriatic arthritis in 5, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in 2, Sjgren syndrome in 1, undifferentiated polyarthritis in 1, and spondyloarthritis in 1."
18670,1960,"Twenty of 81 patients had received gold before: 15 were referred for a second course, 4 a third course, and 1 a fourth course."
18671,1960,Ten of 81 patients were referred for gold as their first disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).
18672,1960,"Seventy-one had received prior DMARD: 1 prior DMARD in 22 patients, 2 in 24 patients, 3 in 15 patients, and > 3 in 6 patients."
18673,1960,Four patients had received prior biologic therapy plus 2 to 4 prior DMARD.
18674,1960,"Twelve of 71 received gold monotherapy, 56/71 received gold/DMARD combinations, and 3 received gold/biologic/DMARD combinations."
18675,1960,"Reasons for referral included failure of other DMARD in 54 patients, limited DMARD options in 50 (chronic liver disease in 34, sulfa allergy in 7, high alcohol consumption in 5, and planning pregnancy in 4), physician choice in 12, previous benefit from gold in 10, benefit of clinic support in 10, inappropriate for biologics in 7, patient choice in 4, and failure of biologics in 3."
18676,1960,CONCLUSION: The most common reasons for referral to gold clinic in 2007 to 2009 are failure of other DMARD and limited DMARD options due to underlying liver disease.
18677,1961,PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation between epidermal growth factor (EFG) and atrophic glossitis (AG) in patients with Sjoigren's syndromes (SS) and explore its pathogenesis.
18678,1961,METHODS: Ninety-three patients with SS (60 with AG and 33 without AG) and 20 normal were selected.
18679,1961,The concentrations of EGF in saliva were analyzed by ELISA.
18680,1961,The expressions of EGF receptor (EGFR) in the epithelial cells of the tongue were assayed by immunohistochemistry.
18681,1961,The differences among each group were analyzed with SPSS19.0 software package.
18682,1961,"RESULTS: The saliva EGF concentrations in SS was lower than that in normal control group(P<0.0001),and EGF concentrations in SS with AG was significantly lower than that in SS without AG (P=0.024)."
18683,1961,"EGF levels in saliva gradually decreased in the mild, moderate and severe atrophic glossitis groups, and there were significant differences among each group(P<0.05)."
18684,1961,"EGFR in the epithelial cells of tongue was lower in SS with moderate and severe AG than in the control group(P=0.009, P=0.037), and there was a significant correlation between EGF and the degree of AG (r=-0.673, P<0.01)."
18685,1961,CONCLUSIONS: Saliva EGF concentrations decrease significantly in patients with SS and it is closely related to the morbidity of atrophic glossitis.
18686,1962,The aim of the study was to analyse the frequency of different Lactobacillus species in relation to the pH-lowering potential of the plaque.
18687,1962,METHODS: Ten subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation (RT group) and 10 subjects with primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS group) and matched controls with normal salivary secretion were included.
18688,1962,Lactobacillus species were selected from their growth on Rogosa agar and identified by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism using HaeIII and HpaII restriction enzymes.
18689,1962,"RESULTS: Lactobacilli were isolated from 14 subjects (6 RT, 3 pSS, 5 controls)."
18690,1962,"The most prevalent species were Lactobacillus fermentum (7 subjects), Lactobacillus casei (7 subjects) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (6 subjects)."
18691,1962,L. fermentum and L. casei were the most prevalent species in anterior sites and L. rhamnosus and L. fermentum in posterior sites.
18692,1962,"In anterior sites, hyposalivated subjects with high Lactobacillus counts had an increased plaque acidogenicity compared to those with low counts."
18693,1962,"In posterior sites, subjects with high Lactobacillus counts had a lower final pH compared with those with low counts."
18694,1962,"CONCLUSION: There were large intra- and inter-individual variations in frequencies of Lactobacillus species and Lactobacillus counts, but no specific species could be related to plaque acidogenicity."
18695,1963,OBJECTIVE: Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) transmits crucial survival signals from the B cell receptor (BCR) in B cells.
18696,1963,"Pharmacologic BTK inhibition effectively diminishes disease symptoms in mouse models of autoimmunity; conversely, transgenic BTK overexpression induces systemic autoimmunity in mice."
18697,1963,We undertook this study to investigate BTK expression and activity in human B cells in the context of autoimmune disease.
18698,1963,"METHODS: Using intracellular flow cytometry, we quantified BTK expression and phosphorylation in subsets of peripheral blood B cells from 30 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 26 patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS), and matched healthy controls."
18699,1963,"RESULTS: In circulating B cells, BTK protein expression levels correlated with BTK phosphorylation."
18700,1963,BTK expression was up-regulated upon BCR stimulation in vitro and was significantly higher in CD27+ memory B cells than in CD27-IgD+ naive B cells.
18701,1963,"Importantly, BTK protein and phospho-BTK were significantly increased in B cells from anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)-positive RA patients but not in B cells from ACPA-negative RA patients."
18702,1963,BTK was increased both in naive B cells and in memory B cells and correlated with frequencies of circulating CCR6+ Th17 cells.
18703,1963,"Likewise, BTK protein was increased in B cells from a major fraction of patients with primary SS and correlated with serum rheumatoid factor levels and parotid gland T cell infiltration."
18704,1963,"Interestingly, targeting T cell activation in patients with primary SS using the CTLA-4Ig fusion protein abatacept restored BTK protein expression in B cells to normal levels."
18705,1963,"CONCLUSION: These data indicate that autoimmune disease in humans is characterized by enhanced BTK activity, which is linked not only to autoantibody formation but also to T cell activity."
18706,1964,"Sjgren's syndrome is a chronic illness manifested characteristically by immune injury to the salivary and lacrimal glands, resulting in dry mouth/eyes."
18707,1964,Anti-Ro [Sjgren's syndrome antigen A (SSA)] and anti-La [Sjgren's syndrome antigen B (SSB)] autoantibodies are found frequently in Sjgren's subjects as well as in individuals who will go on to develop the disease.
18708,1964,Immunization of BALB/c mice with Ro60 peptides results in epitope spreading with anti-Ro and anti-La along with lymphocyte infiltration of salivary glands similar to human Sjgren's.
18709,1964,"In addition, these animals have poor salivary function/low saliva volume."
18710,1964,"In this study, we examined whether Ro-peptide immunization produces a Sjgren's-like illness in other strains of mice."
18711,1964,"BALB/c, DBA-2, PL/J, SJL/J and C57BL/6 mice were immunized with Ro60 peptide-274."
18712,1964,Sera from these mice were studied by immunoblot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for autoantibodies.
18713,1964,"Timed salivary flow was determined after pharmacological stimulation, and salivary glands were examined pathologically."
18714,1964,"We found that SJL/J mice had no immune response to the peptide from Ro60, while C57BL/6 mice produced antibodies that bound the peptide but had no epitope spreading."
18715,1964,"PL/J mice had epitope spreading to other structures of Ro60 as well as to La, but like C57BL/6 and SJL/J had no salivary gland lymphocytic infiltration and no decrement of salivary function."
18716,1964,DBA-2 and BALB/c mice had infiltration but only BALB/c had decreased salivary function.
18717,1964,The immunological processes leading to a Sjgren's-like illness after Ro-peptide immunization were interrupted in a stepwise fashion in these differing mice strains.
18718,1964,"These data suggest that this is a model of preclinical disease with genetic control for epitope spreading, lymphocytic infiltration and glandular dysfunction."
18719,1965,"Objective: Th17 cells, which mainly produce interleukin (IL)-17, have been suggested to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases."
18720,1965,"The plasticity of Th17 cells, in which these cells shift to a Th1 phenotype in the presence of IL-12, has recently been reported."
18721,1965,"However, the role of IL-17 in Sjgren's syndrome (SS) and Mikulicz's disease (MD) currently remains unknown."
18722,1965,PATIENTS AND METHODS: The submandibular salivary gland and lymph node of a MD patient and the salivary glands of 15 SS patients were collected.
18723,1965,"IFN-+ cells, IL-17+ cells, and IFN-+IL-17+ cells were detected by immunohistochemical staining."
18724,1965,"RESULTS: IFN-+ cells, IL-17+ cells, and IFN-+IL-17+ cells were detected in the submandibular salivary gland and lymph node of the MD patient and salivary glands of the 15 SS patients."
18725,1965,DISCUSSION: IFN-+IL-17+cells in the salivary glands of patients were speculated to be Th1/Th17 cells in the present study.
18726,1965,"Th1/Th17 cells are known to be derived from Th17 cells and differentiate into Th1 cells, and IL-17-derived Th1 cells have been suggested to induce the deterioration of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)."
18727,1965,"Thus, Th1/Th17 cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SS and MD."
18728,1965,"CONCLUSION: IFN-+, IFN-+IL-17+, and IL-17+ cells were detected in the submandibular salivary gland and lymph node of a MD patient and the salivary glands of 15 SS patients."
18729,1966,Macrophages (Ms) are critical regulators of immune response and serve as a link between innate and acquired immunity.
18730,1966,The precise mechanism of involvement of tissue-resident Ms in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases is not clear.
18731,1966,"Here, using a murine model for Sjgren's syndrome (SS), we investigated the role of tissue-resident Ms in the onset and development of autoimmunity."
18732,1966,Two unique populations of CD11b(high) and CD11b(low) resident Ms were observed in the target tissue of the SS model.
18733,1966,"Comprehensive gene expression analysis of chemokines revealed effective production of CCL22 by the CD11b(high) Ms. CCL22 upregulated the migratory activity of CD4(+) T cells by increasing CCR4, a receptor of CCL22, on T cells in the SS model."
18734,1966,"In addition, CCL22 enhanced IFN- production of T cells of the SS model, thereby suggesting that CCL22 may impair the local immune tolerance in the target organ of the SS model."
18735,1966,"Moreover, administration of anti-CCL22 antibody suppressed autoimmune lesions in the SS model."
18736,1966,"Finally, histopathological analysis revealed numerous CCL22-producing Ms in the minor salivary gland tissue specimens of the SS patients."
18737,1966,CCL22-producing tissue-resident Ms may control autoimmune lesions by enhancing T cell response in the SS model.
18738,1966,These results suggest that specific chemokines and their receptors may serve as novel therapeutic or diagnostic targets for SS.
18739,1967,"Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterised by destruction of small intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to fibrosis and potential cirrhosis through resulting complications."
18740,1967,"The serological hallmark of primary biliary cirrhosis is the antimitochondrial antibody, a highly disease-specific antibody identified in about 95% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis."
18741,1967,"These patients usually have fatigue and pruritus, both of which occur independently of disease severity."
18742,1967,The typical course of primary biliary cirrhosis has changed substantially with the introduction of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).
18743,1967,Several randomised placebo-controlled studies have shown that UDCA improves transplant-free survival in primary biliary cirrhosis.
18744,1967,"However, about 40% of patients do not have a biochemical response to UDCA and would benefit from new therapies."
18745,1967,Liver transplantation is a life-saving surgery with excellent outcomes for those with decompensated cirrhosis.
18746,1967,"Meanwhile, research on nuclear receptor hormones has led to the development of exciting new potential treatments."
18747,1967,"This Seminar will review the current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and natural history of primary biliary cirrhosis, discuss management of the disease and its sequelae, and introduce research on new therapeutic options."
18748,1968,OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to assess overactive bladder (OAB) symptom bother (SB) and health-related quality of life (HRQL) among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS).
18749,1968,METHODS: We recruited adult SLE and pSS patients and two groups of age- and sex-matched controls.
18750,1968,We applied the OAB questionnaire-short form (OABq-SF) to all participants to assess SB and HRQL and collected clinical information relevant for OAB.
18751,1968,We compared the OABq-SF scores for SB and HRQL between patients and controls using univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis.
18752,1968,"RESULTS: We recruited 95 rheumatic patients (68 SLE, 27 pSS) and 231 controls."
18753,1968,"Compared to controls SLE patients showed higher OABq-SF SB scores (22.620.4 vs 14.717.0, p=0.004) and lower HRQL scores (89.815.8 vs 93.811.4, p=0.044)."
18754,1968,"On multivariate analysis SLE was significantly associated with a higher SB score (-coefficient 7.13, p=0.008) and tended to be associated with worse HRQL values (-coefficient -3.53, p=0.055)."
18755,1968,"Patients with pSS had numerically higher mean SB scores (22.822.5 vs 16.218.0, respectively, p=0.107) and lower HRQL scores (91.010.7 vs 93.211.6, respectively, p=0.369), although these differences were not statistically significant."
18756,1968,Diagnosis of pSS was not significantly associated with SB or HRQL scores on univariate or multivariate analysis.
18757,1968,CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SLE have significantly worse OAB-SB and poorer HRQL compared to controls.
18758,1968,"A similar trend was seen for pSS patients, especially for SB."
18759,1968,"These findings suggest that clinically subtle OAB symptoms may be present in rheumatic patients for whom, later on, bladder pain syndrome may occur."
18760,1969,OBJECTIVE: Chronic autoimmune diseases are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death.
18761,1969,Endothelial dysfunction represents the first stage of subclinical atherosclerosis and multiple factors contribute to endothelial injury.
18762,1969,"Among these, an altered balance between endothelial microparticle (EMP) release and endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) generation promotes endothelial dysfunction."
18763,1969,The role of EMPs and EPCs in promoting endothelial damage in primary SS (pSS) has never been investigated.
18764,1969,Our aim was to evaluate the role of EMPs and EPCs as markers of endothelial damage in pSS and their correlation with disease clinical and immunological features.
18765,1969,"METHODS: Circulating EMPs (CD31(+)/CD42(-)), true EPCs (CD34(+)/KDR(+)/CD133(+)) and mature EPCs (CD34(+)/KDR(+)/CD133(-)) were quantified by FACS analysis in 34 pSS patients and 18 age- and sex-matched controls."
18766,1969,"Correlation between EMP and EPC levels and parameters of disease activity and damage, clinical features and markers of immunological dysfunction was performed."
18767,1969,RESULTS: Patients displayed higher EMP numbers with respect to healthy controls [HCs; mean 450 n/l (S.D.
18768,1969,"155) vs 231 (110), P < 0.0001]."
18769,1969,EPC and mature EPC levels were higher in patients compared with HCs [mean 226 n/ml (S.D.
18770,1969,"181) vs 69 (53), P < 0.001 and 166 (161) vs 36 (32), P < 0.0001, respectively)."
18771,1969,"EMP levels directly correlated with disease duration from symptoms and diagnosis ( = 0.5, P < 0.01)."
18772,1969,"Early EPCs inversely correlated with disease duration from symptoms ( = -0.5, P < 0.01) and diagnosis ( = -0.4, P < 0.05)."
18773,1969,CONCLUSION: This is the first demonstration of chronic endothelial fragmentation characterizing pSS.
18774,1969,The reparative potentiality of the endothelial layer appears to be preserved in the earliest stages of disease.
18775,1969,"During the course of the disease, progressive exhaustion of the precursor endothelial pool may be hypothesized, leading to defective vascular layer restoration and endothelial dysfunction."
18776,1970,"BACKGROUND: Antibodies against type 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3R) are involved in the pathogenesis of Sjgren's syndrome (SS), but the clinical value of them in SS patients has been controversial."
18777,1970,The aims of this study were to: (1) establish an improved enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect IgA antibodies against M3R; (2) evaluate the value of IgA antibodies against the second extracellular loop of M3R205-220 (c2M3RP) in diagnosis of SS.
18778,1970,"METHODS: To increase the ELISA sensitivity, c2M3RP was coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA) by the glutaraldehyde method and a 96-well microplate was treated by ultraviolet rays before coated."
18779,1970,"Concentrations of anti-c2M3RP, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB were measured in the sera of 240 individuals: 91 patients with primary SS and 149 controls (16 secondary SS, 27 systemic lupus erythematosus, 40 rheumatoid arthritis and 66 healthy controls)."
18780,1970,Diagnostic properties of anti-c2M3RP were determined by receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis.
18781,1970,"RESULTS: The prevalence of serum IgA anti-c2M3RP antibodies in patients with pSS (46%, 42/91) was significantly higher than that in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (19%, 5/27), in rheumatoid arthritis (15%, 6/40) and in healthy controls (5%, 3/66)."
18782,1970,"However, there was no significant difference between the two SS groups (P = 0.727)."
18783,1970,"The diagnostic performance of IgA anti-M3RP antibodies was similar to anti-SSA assay, but had 22% higher sensitivity than anti-SSB."
18784,1970,"By analyzing of IgA anti-c2M3RP antibodies, combination of anti-SSA and anti-SSB resulted in increased sensitivity, whereas their specificity was not significantly changed."
18785,1970,"CONCLUSIONS: The improved anti-c2M3RP ELISA is a novel, sensitive, and specific serological test for the diagnosis of SS."
18786,1970,"The combined application of anti-c2M3RP, anti-SSA and anti-SSB tests can improve the laboratory diagnosis of SS."
18787,1970,The IgA anti-c2M3RP antibodies may serve as a novel diagnostic marker for SS.
18788,1971,OBJECTIVE: To assess disease features in Sle1.Yaa mice with genetic interleukin-6 (IL-6) deficiency.
18789,1971,"METHODS: Sera and tissues were collected from C57BL/6 (B6), Sle1.Yaa, and Sle1.Yaa.IL-6(-/-) mice and analyzed for various features of disease."
18790,1971,"Using serum samples, autoantibody specificities were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence, cytokine production was analyzed by Luminex and ELISA, and levels of blood urea nitrogen were determined by ELISA."
18791,1971,"Renal, lung, and salivary gland tissue sections were evaluated for pathologic changes."
18792,1971,"Lymphocyte phenotypes, including CD4+ T cell cytokine production, and those of follicular and extrafollicular T helper subsets, germinal center B cells, and plasma cells, were determined using flow cytometry."
18793,1971,"RESULTS: IL-6 deficiency not only ameliorated autoantibody production and renal disease in this model, but also effectively reduced inflammation of lungs and salivary glands."
18794,1971,"Furthermore, IL-6 deficiency abrogated differentiation of Th1 and extrafollicular T helper cells, germinal center B cells, and plasma cells in the spleen and eliminated renal T cells with IL-17, interferon-, and IL-21 production potential."
18795,1971,"CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight IL-6-mediated T cell aberrations in Yaa-driven autoimmunity and support the concept of therapeutic IL-6/IL-6 receptor blockade in systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjgren's syndrome by impairing the production of autoantibodies and lymphocytic infiltration of the kidneys, lungs, and salivary glands."
18796,1972,OBJECTIVE: To define parameters predictive of lymphoma development in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS).
18797,1972,METHODS: A multicenter case-control survey was performed to identify predictors of lymphoma.
18798,1972,Cases were patients who developed lymphoma after diagnosis of primary SS and were mainly recruited through the Club Rhumatismes et Inflammation network.
18799,1972,"For each case, 2 controls (matched for disease duration and age) were randomly selected among patients with primary SS and without lymphoma."
18800,1972,Cases and controls were compared using univariate analysis and then using multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors of lymphoma.
18801,1972,RESULTS: One hundred one patients with primary SS and lymphoma were included.
18802,1972,"Eighty-seven patients were women (86.1%), and the meanSD age at lymphoma diagnosis was 57.412.6 years."
18803,1972,"The most frequent histologic type was B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in 99 of 101 patients, with marginal-zone lymphoma in 76 of the 99 patients (76.8%) including 58 (58.6%) with lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type."
18804,1972,Lymphomas were most frequently located in the salivary glands (43 patients).
18805,1972,"A specific treatment was initiated at diagnosis in 87 patients with B cell NHL, and 61 patients (61.6%) achieved complete sustained remission after the first line of treatment."
18806,1972,"In the multivariate analysis, salivary gland enlargement, the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF), low C4, cryoglobulinemia, lymphopenia, and disease activity according to the European League Against Rheumatism Sjgren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (excluding the lymphoma domain) were found to be predictors of lymphoma."
18807,1972,No previous treatment for primary SS was associated with any effect on lymphoma occurrence.
18808,1972,"CONCLUSION: In addition to previously known factors predictive of lymphoma occurrence, the independent roles of RF and disease activity were demonstrated in this case-control study of primary SS-associated lymphoma."
18809,1972,Our findings highlight the roles of chronic antigenic stimulation and disease activity in the development of this severe complication.
18810,1973,"BACKGROUND: Although most commonly encountered in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is becoming more common in patients receiving immunosuppressive medications."
18811,1973,"Disseminated MAC with skin lesions may occur, and several presentations have been reported, including panniculitis, cutaneous granulomas, pustules, ulcerations, and erythematous skin lesions."
18812,1973,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this report is to describe an unusual presentation of MAC that is unlikely to be encountered frequently in the outpatient dermatology setting, especially in a patient without human immunodeficiency virus infection."
18813,1973,METHODS: The authors present a case of disseminated MAC infection with cutaneous manifestations in an iatrogenically immunocompromised patient.
18814,1973,CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of MAC infection is challenging given the varied clinical presentations and the difficulty in culturing MAC.
18815,1973,"In addition, the acid-fast stain is nonspecific."
18816,1973,"Clinicians should remember to consider MAC infection in patients with acid-fast-positive skin lesions, as the selection of appropriate antibiotic therapy is species specific."
18817,1974,The diagnosis of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) is difficult due to the lack of specific laboratory and clinical tests.
18818,1974,"As an initial step for the global discovery of changes in the abundance of parotid salivary proteins in pSS, a pooled sample was compared to that from healthy control subjects by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT)."
18819,1974,A total of 1246 proteins were identified by MudPIT.
18820,1974,"The abundance of 477 of these proteins did not change, 529 were only detected in either the pSS or HC sample, while 206 of these proteins were significantly upregulated  twofold and 34 were downregulated  0.5."
18821,1974,Ingenuity Pathway Analyses of differentially expressed proteins identified by MudPIT resulted in the identification of 100 significant pathways.
18822,1974,The same samples were quantified in parallel using RP MS. Fifty-eight of 71 proteins identified by RP overlapped with MudPIT results.
18823,1974,Five proteins were further analyzed by targeted label-free quantification to confirm the similar relative differential expression observed by RP and MudPIT approaches.
18824,1974,The present study supports the use of MS for global discovery and validation of marker proteins for improved and early diagnosis of pSS.
18825,1975,BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical features of patients who developed collagen vascular disease (CVD) after an initial diagnosis of idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP).
18826,1975,"METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 72 consecutive patients with NSIP who were diagnosed by surgical lung biopsy in our institution (idiopathic NSIP, n=35; CVD-NSIP, n=37at initial diagnosis)."
18827,1975,No patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for a diagnosis with CVD within six months after the diagnosis of idiopathic NSIP.
18828,1975,"RESULTS: Of 35 patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic NSIP, six patients (17.1%) developed CVD during the follow-up period (5.55.0 years); three patients were diagnosed with dermatomyositis (DM), two patients with overlap syndrome (DM and Sjogren's syndrome), and one patient with rheumatoid arthritis."
18829,1975,"The mean time until CVD diagnosis was 2.0 years (six months - 3.5 years), and the one-, two- and three-year incidences of CVD development were 3.6%, 15.2% and 20.0%, respectively."
18830,1975,"There was no significant difference in clinical characteristics and survival among patients with NSIP preceding CVD diagnosis, those with idiopathic NSIP, or those with CVD-NSIP."
18831,1975,"In addition, at the time of initial diagnosis, there was no significant difference for the fulfillment of previous criteria such as interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune feature (IPAF) between patients with NSIP preceding CVD diagnosis and those with idiopathic NSIP."
18832,1975,CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to predict CVD occurrence and careful attention is needed to detect the development of CVD in patients with idiopathic NSIP.
18833,1976,Squamous cell carcinoma is a known complication reported to occur in chronic discoid lupus erythematosus in sun-exposed areas.
18834,1976,We report a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus who developed a squamous cell carcinoma in a recent plaque of discoid lupus erythematosus in a sun-protected area.
18835,1976,This article emphasizes the need for a very high index of suspicion for squamous cell carcinoma and repeated biopsies when discoid lupus erythematosus fails to respond to conventional therapy or there is unexplained exacerbation.
18836,1977,"We report a case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and Sjogren syndrome (SjS) that was treated with the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, etanercept (ETN)."
18837,1977,Both RA activity and transaminase levels improved as a result of treatment.
18838,1977,Follow-up liver biopsy showed improvement of hepatitis.
18839,1977,"Although the efficacy of anti-TNF for RA patients with AIH remains controversial, this case suggests that treatment with ETN may result in a favorable clinical course in a certain subset of patients with RA and AIH."
18840,1978,Sjgren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by clonal B cell attack of the exocrine glands and dysregulated expression of B cell-activating factor (BAFF).
18841,1978,"Based upon the current data of increased rates of lymphoid malignancy, as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is associated with SS, we propose the detection of clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene in those patients as a predictor of malignant clonal expansion."
18842,1978,"To test our proposal, we examined the IgH clonal rearrangements in SS patients (60) and healthy control subjects (42) having chronic non-specific sialadenitis, to determine the presence of clonal B cells in minor labial salivary glands (MSG) of SS patients."
18843,1978,"Clonal B cell expansion was assessed by two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays: (i) semi-nested PCR, against sequences encoding framework regions FR3, FR2 and FR1c of the variable chain IgH gene in B cells present in the MSG infiltrate; and (ii) the PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, against the major and minor breakpoint regions of the Bcl-2 oncogene coupled with a variable segment of the IgH to assess the Bcl-2/JH translocation."
18844,1978,"When FR3, FR2 and FR1c primers were employed, we detected B cell monoclonality in 87% of the SS patients and 19% of the control subjects."
18845,1978,The association between inflammation severity of the MSG pattern and the presence of B cell clonality was found to be statistically significant (P<0.01).
18846,1978,We concluded that the presence of B cell clonality in MSG can be used as a index of an altered microenvironment favouring the development of lymphoma in SS patients.
18847,1979,We recently reported the presence of anti-aquaporin 5 (AQP5) immunoglobulin G (IgG) in patients with primary Sjgren syndrome (SS) with a sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.68.
18848,1979,The aim of this study was to identify functional epitopes for the anti-AQP5 autoantibodies detected in control subjects and patients with SS.
18849,1979,"Recognition of epitopes by anti-AQP5 autoantibodies in sera ( n = 13 for control and n = 24 for SS) or purified IgG ( n = 1 for control and n = 3 for SS) was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay performed in the presence or absence of peptides corresponding to the second transmembrane helix and extracellular loops A, C, and E of AQP5."
18850,1979,Functional epitopes were determined by measuring the effects of purified IgG and neutralizing peptides on transepithelial osmotic permeability (P(f)(T)) of MDCK cells expressing AQP5.
18851,1979,"In the IIF assay, 89% of SS samples were inhibited by at least 1 peptide, while only half of control samples were inhibited by any peptide."
18852,1979,"Overall, SS samples were inhibited by peptides corresponding to extracellular loops A, C, and E by 40% to 50%, whereas control samples were inhibited only by peptides corresponding to loop E by <20%."
18853,1979,A cyclized peptide (E1) mimicking loop E was most frequently recognized and best differentiated between the SS and control samples.
18854,1979,"Incubation of MDCK-AQP5 cells with SS but not with control IgG, significantly decreased P(f)(T), which was reversed by neutralization of IgG binding to any of the extracellular loops."
18855,1979,"In conclusion, the anti-AQP5 autoantibodies detected in control and SS groups showed differences in fine specificity to the functional epitopes of AQP5."
18856,1979,The prevalent recognition of functional epitopes by anti-AQP5 autoantibodies from SS patients suggests that anti-AQP5 autoantibodies act as mediators of glandular hypofunction and are a potential therapeutic target in SS.
18857,1980,CD6 is a cell surface receptor expressed on the majority of T cells and a subset of B cells.
18858,1980,"When expressed, CD6 contributes to lymphocyte activation through its extracellular domain 1, while adhesion and cellular migration are related to the extracellular scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain (SRCR-D)-3 of CD6."
18859,1980,"Itolizumab, clone T1h, is a newly developed humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets CD6 SRCR-D1 and blocks immune activation."
18860,1980,"Itolizumab has been proposed to be effective in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjgren's syndrome and multiple sclerosis."
18861,1980,"In Sjgren's syndrome, the utilization of itolizumab as therapeutic option is reinforced by our recent observation that ALCAM, the CD6 ligand, is overexpressed and that CD6-positive T and B cells are detected within salivary glands from Sjgren's syndrome patients."
18862,1980,"In this study, itolizumab-positive target cells were characterized within both peripheral blood and salivary glands in order to provide rational for anti-CD6 treatment in Sjgren's syndrome."
18863,1981,"Recently, the association of Th-17 cells or IL-17 with ocular inflammatory diseases such as uveitis, scleritis and dry eye syndrome was discovered."
18864,1981,We assessed whether interleukin (IL)-17 was present in the tears of various ocular surface inflammatory diseases and the tear IL-17 concentrations were clinically correlated with various ocular surface inflammatory diseases.
18865,1981,"We measured concentrations of IL-17 in tears of normal subjects (n = 28) and patients (n = 141) with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), dry eye syndrome (DES), Sjgren syndrome (SS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), filamentary keratitis, and autoimmune keratitis associated with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus."
18866,1981,Clinical epitheliopathy scores were based on the surface area of corneal and conjunctival fluorescein staining.
18867,1981,"The mean concentrations of IL-17 in tears of patients with filamentary keratitis, GVHD, autoimmune keratitis, SS, DES, MGD, SJS were significantly higher in order than that in normal subjects."
18868,1981,"Tear IL-17 concentration was significantly correlated with clinical epitheilopathy scores in the patients with systemic inflammatory disease, while tear IL-17 was not correlated with clinical severity of the cornea and conjunctiva in the dry eye patients without any systemic inflammatory disease."
18869,1981,Tear IL-17 is likely to correlate clinically with corneal disease severity only in the patients with systemic inflammatory disease.
18870,1982,Anti-SS-A antibodies are often sought for in autoimmune diseases diagnosis.
18871,1982,Two different target proteins have actually been identified: Ro52 and Ro60.
18872,1982,Clinical and immunological associations seem different depending on anti-Ro52 or anti-Ro60 antibodies presence.
18873,1982,"However, due to a heterogeneous presentation in the literature, some immunology laboratories in France have stopped providing anti-Ro52 antibody findings."
18874,1982,We report here a new hospital study designed to determine the diagnostic utility of the separate detection of anti-Ro52 and anti-Ro60 antibodies.
18875,1982,"We conducted a retrospective, observational study, including every adult patient with positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) tested in our immunology laboratory, and associated with anti-Ro52 and/or anti-Ro60 antibodies, between 2011 and 2014."
18876,1982,"Out of 13032 sera tested for ANA, 399 adults had antibodies to Ro52 and/or Ro60; 81.7% were female, with a mean age of 54.5  17.0 years."
18877,1982,Anti-Ro52 antibodies were found in 75.7% of the patients and anti-Ro60 antibodies in 56.9%.
18878,1982,"Among them, 43.1% were classified in the Ro52 + Ro60- group, 32.6% in the Ro52 + Ro60 + group and 24.3% in the Ro52-Ro60+ group."
18879,1982,"In the Ro52-Ro60+ group, systemic lupus was the most frequent diagnosis (48.5%), with a possible association with antiphospholipid antibodies (anti-cardiolipin antibodies: OR 2.5 (CI95 [1.0-5.0], p = 0.05) and lupus anticoagulant {OR 3.6 (CI95 [1.10-10.0] p = 0.02)}."
18880,1982,"In the Ro52+Ro60+, primary Sjgren Syndrome was the most likely (OR 4.2 95% CI [2.1-8.3] p < 10(-4)), especially in patients Ro52+Ro60+La+."
18881,1982,"Patients with isolated anti-Ro52 had a wider variety of diseases associated, but among auto-immune diseases they were more prone to inflammatory myositis (OR 10.5 [1.4-81.7], p = 0.02) and inflammatory rheumatism (OR 4.6 [1.6-13.8], p = 0.006) in contrast to systemic lupus (OR 0.2 [0.1-0.3], p < 10(-4)) or primary Sjgren's syndrome (OR 0.1 [0.06-0.2], p < 10(-4))."
18882,1982,"We therefore suggest that, when anti-ENA antibodies are prescribed, it should include separate anti-Ro52 and anti-Ro60 antibodies determination."
18883,1982,"To go even further, we would like to suggest a change in ENA nomenclature to avoid confusion, abandoning the anti-SS-A label in favor of the anti-Ro52/TRIM21 or anti-Ro60 antibody for a clearer designation."
18884,1983,"La antigen (Sjgren's syndrome antigen B) is a phosphoprotein associated with nascent precursor tRNAs and other RNAs, and it is targeted by autoantibodies in patients with Sjgren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and neonatal lupus."
18885,1983,"Increased levels of La are associated with leukemias and other cancers, and various viruses usurp La to promote their replication."
18886,1983,"Yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) genetically depleted of La grow and proliferate, whereas deletion from mice causes early embryonic lethality, raising the question of whether La is required by mammalian cells generally or only to surpass a developmental stage."
18887,1983,We developed a conditional La allele and used it in mice that express Cre recombinase in either B cell progenitors or the forebrain.
18888,1983,B cell Mb1(Cre) La-deleted mice produce no B cells.
18889,1983,"Consistent with CamKII Cre, which induces deletion in hippocampal CA1 cells in the third postnatal week and later throughout the neocortex, brains develop normally in La-deleted mice until 5 weeks and then lose a large amount of forebrain cells and mass, with evidence of altered pre-tRNA processing."
18890,1983,The data indicate that La is required not only in proliferating cells but also in nondividing postmitotic cells.
18891,1983,"Thus, La is essential in different cell types and required for normal development of various tissue types."
18892,1984,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Chinese herbal medicines for nourishing yin, supplementing qi, and activating blood on the reproductive endocrine-immune network and its mechanisms in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS)."
18893,1984,METHODS: Seventy pSS patients were randomly assigned to two groups using a randomized digital table: the integrative therapy group (36 cases) and the control group (34 cases).
18894,1984,Thirty healthy subjects were taken as a normal group.
18895,1984,"The control group was treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets alone, and the integrative therapy group was treated by Chinese herbal medicines for nourishing yin, supplementing qi, and activating blood combined with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets."
18896,1984,The treatment course was 6 months for both groups.
18897,1984,"Before and after treatment, serum estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL) by radioimmunoassay and immunoglobulin (IgG) by immunodiffusion, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) by Westergren, interferon- (IFN-) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay were determined."
18898,1984,RESULTS: E2 and T levels in all patients were lower than those of normal subjects before treatment (P<0.05) and were increased significantly after 6-month treatment (P<0.05).
18899,1984,"ESR, FSH, LH, IgG, IFN - , IL - 4 and ratios of E2/T, and IFN -/IL in the patients were higher than those of normal subjects before the treatments (P<0.05), and were reduced significantly after the treatments (P<0.05)."
18900,1984,The T and IFN -  levels and E2/T ratio in the patients treated with integrative therapy were reduced significantly compared with the control group (P<0.05).
18901,1984,"However, the PRL levels before and after treatment were not significantly changed in the two groups (P>0.05)."
18902,1984,"The ratios of E2/T and IFN -/IL-4, and levels of IgG and ESR were positively correlated before and after treatment (P<0.05)."
18903,1984,CONCLUSIONS: The ratios of E2/T and IFN -/IL-4 might be used as indicators of pSS activity.
18904,1984,"Chinese herbal medicines for nourishing yin, supplementing qi, and activating blood combined with Western medicine could improve the therapeutic effect by regulating the reproductive endocrine-immune network in pSS patients."
18905,1985,"PURPOSE: Extracellular high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) acts as a damage associated molecular pattern molecule through the Toll-like receptor to promote autoreactive B cell activation, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of Sjgren's syndrome."
18906,1985,The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of subconjunctival administration of anti-HMGB1 on dry eye in a mouse model of Sjgren's syndrome.
18907,1985,METHODS: Ten weeks-old NOD.B10.H2b mice were subconjunctivally injected with 0.02 to 2 g of anti-HMGB1 antibodies or PBS twice a week for two consecutive weeks.
18908,1985,Tear volume and corneal staining scores were measured and compared between before- and after-treatment.
18909,1985,Goblet cell density was counted in PAS stained forniceal conjunctiva and inflammatory foci score (>50 cells/focus) was measured in extraorbital glands.
18910,1985,"Flow cytometry was performed to evaluate the changes in BrdU+ cells, IL-17-, IL-10-, or IFN-secreting cells, functional B cells, and IL-22 secreting innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) in cervical lymph nodes."
18911,1985,The level of IL-22 in intraorbital glands was measured by ELISA.
18912,1985,RESULTS: Injection of 2 g or 0.02 g anti-HMGB1 attenuated corneal epithelial erosions and increased tear secretion (p<0.05).
18913,1985,Goblet cell density was increased in 0.2 g and 2 g anti-HMGB1-treated-mice with marginal significance.
18914,1985,"The inflammatory foci score, and the number of BrdU+ cells, IL-17-, IL-10-, IFN-secreting cells, and functional B cells did not significantly change following anti-HMGB1 treatment."
18915,1985,"Surprisingly, the percentage of ILC3s was significantly increased in the draining lymph nodes (p<0.05), and the expression of IL-22 was significantly increased in the intraorbital glands (p<0.05) after administration of 2 g anti-HMGB1."
18916,1985,CONCLUSION: This study shows that subconjunctival administration of anti-HMGB1 attenuates clinical manifestations of dry eye.
18917,1985,"The improvement of dry eye may involve an increase of ILC3s, rather than modulation of B or plasma cells, as shown using a mouse model of Sjgren's syndrome."
18918,1986,The many features that link autoimmune disorders (AD) and lymphoma are reviewed herein.
18919,1986,"Firstly, the epidemiology indicates the increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) development in many AD, and especially in Sjgren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus."
18920,1986,"In these AD, the relative risk of NHL occurrence varies between 2 and 4 up to 40 fold higher than in the general population, according to various surveys."
18921,1986,Factors favouring or predicting NHL have been reported in detail.
18922,1986,B-cell activation and proliferation are part of AD and are essential factors for the onset of malignant cell clones in a deregulated immunological environment.
18923,1986,Targeting deregulated or malignant B-cells is the goal of some newly developed treatments.
18924,1986,The prototype is anti-CD20 rituximab that has substantially modified the prognosis of B-cell NHL and is also an effective new treatment opportunity for some AD.
18925,1986,"Similarly, intensified treatments with autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT) that were developed for high-risk lymphoma are now under advanced investigation for use in some refractory AD."
18926,1986,"Thus, the successful use of rituximab and ASCT in both AD and NHL further emphasizes the close link between these two entities."
18927,1986,"This review provides details on the main epidemiological features regarding NHL incidence in AD, the pathogenetic factors that favour lymphoma onset and some recent advances in therapeutic approaches that are effective in both autoimmune and malignant lymphoproliferative disorders."
18928,1987,"Inhibitory coreceptors are thought to play important roles in maintaining immunological homeostasis, and a defect in the negative signals from inhibitory coreceptors may lead to the development of autoimmune diseases."
18929,1987,"We have recently identified B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), a new inhibitory coreceptor expressed on immune cells, and we suggest that BTLA may be involved in the development of autoimmune diseases using BTLA-deficient mice."
18930,1987,"However, the role of BTLA in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases in humans remains unknown."
18931,1987,"We, therefore, examined the possible association between BTLA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and Sjgren's syndrome (SS) by conducting a case-control genetic association study."
18932,1987,"We found that 590C single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of BTLA gene was significantly associated with susceptibility to RA, but not to SLE or SS."
18933,1987,"Furthermore, RA patients bearing this 590C SNP developed the disease significantly earlier than the patients without this allele."
18934,1987,We also found that BTLA with 590C allele lacked the inhibitory activity on concanavalin A- and anti-CD3 Ab-induced IL-2 production in Jurkat T cells.
18935,1987,These results suggest that BTLA is an RA-susceptibility gene and is involved in the protection from autoimmunity in humans.
18936,1988,There are no clearly established protocols for the treatment of dry mouth.
18937,1988,"The aim of this paper is a systematic review of the literature of the past 10 years using the words  dry mouth ,  prognosis ,  treatment  and  dentistry ."
18938,1988,"The initial search found 1,450 entries and within the restriction  clinical trials OR randomized controlled trial OR systemic reviews  it has been reduced to 522, which 145 were meta-analysis and systematic reviews."
18939,1988,Papers not relevant to the issue were removed reducing the entries to 53.
18940,1988,"Twenty-four were dismissed (8 irrelevant, 7 reviews without adequate information and 9 personal opinions)."
18941,1988,"Of the 29 items tested, 15 were controlled trials, 2 uncontrolled trials, 4 observational studies, 2 systematic reviews and 5 non systematic reviews."
18942,1988,The most studied patients were Sjgren's syndrome and the irradiated patients.
18943,1988,"Treatments are focused on the etiology, prevention, symptomatic, local salivary stimulation and systemic treatments."
18944,1988,"It can be concluded that treatment must be individualized, salivary substitutes and mechanical stimulation techniques can be applied."
18945,1989,"OBJECTIVE: Interleukin-14-transgenic (IL-14TG) mice develop an autoimmune exocrinopathy with characteristics similar to Sjgren's syndrome, including sialadenitis and hyposalivation."
18946,1989,"The P2Y(2) receptor (P2Y(2) R) for extracellular ATP and UTP is upregulated during salivary gland inflammation (i.e., sialadenitis) where it regulates numerous inflammatory responses."
18947,1989,This study investigated the role of P2Y(2) Rs in autoimmune sialadenitis in the IL-14TG mouse model of Sjgren's syndrome.
18948,1989,MATERIALS AND METHODS: IL-14TG mice were bred with P2Y(2) R(-/-) mice to generate IL-14TGP2Y(2) R(-/-) mice.
18949,1989,"P2Y(2) R expression, lymphocytic focus scores, B- and T-cell accumulation, and lymphotoxin- expression were evaluated in the submandibular glands (SMG) along with carbachol-stimulated saliva secretion in IL-14TG, IL-14TGP2Y(2) R(-/-) , and C57BL/6 control mice at 9 and 12months of age."
18950,1989,RESULTS: Genetic ablation of P2Y(2) Rs in IL-14TG mice significantly reduced B and T lymphocyte infiltration of SMGs.
18951,1989,"However, reduced sialadenitis did not restore saliva secretion in IL-14TGP2Y(2) R(-/-) mice."
18952,1989,"Decreased sialadenitis in IL-14TGP2Y(2) R(-/-) mice correlated with decreased lymphotoxin- levels, a critical proinflammatory cytokine associated with autoimmune pathology in IL-14TG mice."
18953,1989,CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that P2Y(2) Rs contribute to the development of salivary gland inflammation in IL-14TG mice and may also contribute to autoimmune sialadenitis in humans.
18954,1990,OBJECTIVE: To estimate the future risk and time trends of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in individuals with newly diagnosed primary Sjgren syndrome (pSS) in the general population.
18955,1990,"METHODS: Using a population database that includes all residents of British Columbia, Canada, we created a study cohort of all patients with incident SS and up to 10 controls from the general population matched for age, sex, and entry time."
18956,1990,"We compared incidence rates (IR) of pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and VTE between the 2 groups according to SS disease duration."
18957,1990,"We calculated HR, adjusting for confounders."
18958,1990,"RESULTS: Among 1175 incident pSS cases (mean age 56.7 yrs, 87.6% women), the IR of PE, DVT, and VTE were 3.9, 2.8, and 5.2 per 1000 person-years (PY), respectively; the corresponding rates in the comparison cohort were 0.9, 0.8, and 1.4 per 1000 PY."
18959,1990,"Compared with non-SS individuals, the multivariable HR for PE, DVT, and VTE among SS cases were 4.07 (95% CI 2.04-8.09), 2.80 (95% CI 1.27-6.17), and 2.92 (95% CI 1.66-5.16), respectively."
18960,1990,"The HR matched for age, sex, and entry time for VTE, PE, and DVT were highest during the first year after SS diagnosis (8.29, 95% CI 2.57-26.77; 4.72, 95% CI 1.13-19.73; and 7.34, 95% CI 2.80-19.25, respectively)."
18961,1990,"CONCLUSION: These findings provide population-based evidence that patients with pSS have a substantially increased risk of VTE, especially within the first year after SS diagnosis."
18962,1990,Further research into the involvement of monitoring and prevention of VTE in SS may be warranted.
18963,1991,INTRODUCTION: Antimalarial medications are basal active drugs used for the treatment of various rheumatological conditions.
18964,1991,Their common side-effects include eye damage.
18965,1991,AIM: The aim of this study is to determine the safety of antimalarial medications used for rheumatological conditions and the incidence of retinopathy.
18966,1991,"MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients with rheumatological conditions, who were followed in our rheumatology clinics between 2005 and 2009 while under chloroquine (CQ) and/or hydroxychloroquine (HQ) treatment were included in the study."
18967,1991,"Indirect ophthalmoscopic examination with 90 dioptry lens, frontal segment examination and macular visual area test were applied to all patients."
18968,1991,"Severity of retinopathy was evaluated as mild initial defect in the macula, or severe visual area loss."
18969,1991,RESULTS: Retinopathy findings were detected in 21 out of 85 patients (24.7%).
18970,1991,"Of these patients, 12 had mild initial defects while nine had severe visual area loss."
18971,1991,"Of 21 patients, eight were on HQ and 13 were on CQ treatment."
18972,1991,"Of the patients seen with findings of retinopathy, 17 had comorbid hypertension (HT) and six had diabetes mellitus (DM)."
18973,1991,Patients receiving CQ are under higher risk compared to those on HQ treatment (P = 0.001).
18974,1991,"Patient age, disease duration, HT and DM presence had no statistically significant effect on retinopathy development (P = 0.144, P = 0.305, P = 0.258, P = 0.395, respectively)."
18975,1991,CONCLUSION: The incidence of retinopathy among patients using antimalarial medications as observed in this study was relatively high.
18976,1991,"Based on these results, it is essential to emphasize the importance of close monitoring in patients receiving antimalarial medications and evaluation of visual findings before treatment initiation."
18977,1992,OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to analyse the prevalence of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) in primary SS (pSS) and to compare a novel urinary acidification test with furosemide and fludrocortisone (FF) with the gold standard ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) to detect dRTA.
18978,1992,METHODS: Urinary acidification was assessed in 57 pSS patients using NH4Cl and FF.
18979,1992,A urinary acidification defect was defined as an inability to reach a urinary pH of <5.3 after NH4Cl.
18980,1992,RESULTS: The prevalence of complete dRTA (urinary acidification defect with acidosis) was 5% (3/57).
18981,1992,All three patients had positive SSA/Ro and SSB/La autoantibodies and impaired kidney function.
18982,1992,The prevalence of incomplete dRTA (urinary acidification defect without acidosis) was 25% (14/57).
18983,1992,"Compared with patients without dRTA, patients with incomplete dRTA had significantly lower venous pH and serum bicarbonate and higher urinary pH."
18984,1992,SSB/La antibodies were more prevalent in the dRTA groups (P < 0.05).
18985,1992,"Compared with NH4Cl, the positive and negative predictive values of FF were 46% and 82%, respectively."
18986,1992,"Vomiting occurred more often during the urinary acidification test with NH4Cl than with FF (9 vs 0, P < 0.05)."
18987,1992,"CONCLUSION: Incomplete dRTA is common in pSS and causes mild acidaemia and higher urinary pH, which may contribute to bone demineralization and kidney stone formation."
18988,1992,"FF cannot replace NH4Cl in testing urinary acidification in pSS, but may be considered as a screening tool, given its reasonable negative predictive value and better tolerability."
18989,1993,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of rheumatoid factor (RF) and antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP) in patients with Sjgren syndrome (SS) secondary to rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
18990,1993,"METHODS: The study included 118 individuals, and the subjects were divided into three groups: rheumatoid arthritis (RA; n = 46), RA with secondary Sjgren syndrome (RA/SS; n = 20) and healthy controls (C; n = 52)."
18991,1993,"Clinical and laboratory characteristics, including ocular, oral, and serum markers, anti-CCP, and rheumatoid factor (RF), were compared in addition to biopsy of labial minor salivary glands."
18992,1993,"RESULTS: The RA group exhibited unstimulated salivary flow rate, and Schirmer test results were similar to those for C and higher than those for RA/SS (P < .05)."
18993,1993,"Furthermore, the frequency of xerophthalmia and xerostomia was similar among the RA and C groups, and much higher in the RA/SS group (P < .05)."
18994,1993,"Anti-CCP positivity and serum levels were similar in both RA groups, irrespective of SS diagnosis (RA  RA/SS; P > .05)."
18995,1993,RF presented a similar frequency and serum level between the RA and RA/SS groups (P > .05).
18996,1993,CONCLUSIONS: Secondary SS seems to be a cluster of oral and ocular symptoms among patients with RA.
18997,1993,Anti-CCP and RF are not relevant to evaluate the presence of SS among these patients.
18998,1994,"Salivary glands mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (SGML) is a distinct subtype of marginal zone B-cell type non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), which is commonly seen in middle aged females."
18999,1994,SGML is usually associated with autoimmune diseases such as Sjgren's syndrome or with chronic infection such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.
19000,1994,"Chromosomal abnormalities are frequently seen in SGML, which usually activate nuclear factor-B molecular pathway to modulate cell survival and proliferation, resulting in lymphoma occurrence."
19001,1994,"SGML tends to arise from parotid gland, presenting frequently as a localized and indolent lesion, a long-term follow-up and biopsy are needed for accurate diagnosis."
19002,1994,"Surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are usually effective disseminated diseases at multiple sites need combined treatment."
19003,1994,"SGML has a relatively better prognosis with a higher relapse rate than other types of NHLs, dissemination or higher degree of malignant transformation may occur."
19004,1994,"Thus, a long-term and close follow-up is essential for patients with SGML."
19005,1995,"This study tested the hypothesis that B cells from salivary tissue are distinct in terms of proliferative capacity, immunoglobulin M secretion, repertoire, and autoantibody enrichment in Sjgren's syndrome."
19006,1995,"We sorted purified B cells from the spleen, cervical lymph nodes, and submandibular glands of a primary Sjgren's syndrome mouse model (Id3(-/-))."
19007,1995,Enzyme-linked immunospot and proliferation assays were performed with stimulated B cells.
19008,1995,"We single-cell sorted B cells from the spleen, cervical lymph nodes, and submandibular gland tissue from Sjgren's syndrome mice and sequenced immunoglobulin M heavy-chain variable regions."
19009,1995,"Finally, autoantigen arrays were performed using immunoglobulin M derived from sera, cervical lymph nodes, spleens, and submandibular gland tissue of Id3(-/-) animals."
19010,1995,Results suggest B cells from salivary tissue of Sjgren's syndrome mice are similar to those from secondary immune sites in terms of proliferative and secretory capacity.
19011,1995,"However, differences in repertoire usage, heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 length, mutational frequency, and N region addition were observed among B cells derived from submandibular gland, cervical lymph node, and spleen tissue."
19012,1995,"Moreover, autoantigen array data show immunoglobulin M from salivary B cells have enriched specificity for Ro (Sjgren's syndrome A) and La (Sjgren's syndrome B)."
19013,1995,"All together, these data suggest salivary B cells have unique repertoire characteristics that likely influence autoantigen binding and contribute to Sjgren's syndrome disease in a tissue-specific manner."
19014,1996,OBJECTIVE: Analysis of B cell determinants of Ro 60 exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells (apotopes) or intracellular epitopes provides insight into the structural forms of the autoantigen that break immune tolerance.
19015,1996,This study was initiated to compare anti-Ro 60 responses in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjgren's syndrome (SS) against membrane-bound and intracellular forms of Ro 60.
19016,1996,METHODS: The reactivity of autoantibodies from patients with SLE and primary SS to Ro 60 apotopes and epitopes was assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry and solid-phase immunoassay.
19017,1996,"Anti-Ro 60 IgG was eluted from early apoptotic cells or recombinant Ro 60 immobilized on nitrocellulose, and binding to membrane-bound and intracellular forms of Ro 60 was quantitated by flow cytometry."
19018,1996,"RESULTS: An immunodominant apotope, which was recognized by IgG from a subset of SLE patients with anti-Ro, but not anti-La, autoantibodies, was mapped to a region forming a helix-loop-helix at the apical tip of the Ro 60 molecule."
19019,1996,Immobilization of this region to the solid phase exposed an epitope that was recognized by IgG from primary SS and SLE patients whose sera had both anti-Ro and anti-La autoantibodies.
19020,1996,Autoantibodies eluted from either the surface of apoptotic cells or the Ro 60 epitope on the solid phase were non-cross-reactive and specifically recognized membrane-bound or cytoplasmic forms of Ro 60.
19021,1996,CONCLUSION: This is the first example of a dichotomy of human autoantibody responses against mutually exclusive determinants linked to a single domain of a systemic autoantigen and supports a model in which tolerance is broken by different immunogenic forms of Ro 60.
19022,1997,"The atypical chemokine receptor CCX-CKR regulates bioavailability of CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25, homeostatic chemokines that play crucial roles in thymic lymphopoiesis."
19023,1997,Deletion of CCX-CKR results in accelerated experimental autoimmunity induced by immunization.
19024,1997,"Here we show that CCX-CKR deletion also increases incidence of a spontaneous Sjgren's syndrome-like pathology, characterized by lymphocytic infiltrates in salivary glands and liver of CCX-CKR(-/-) mice, suggestive of a defect in self-tolerance when CCX-CKR is deleted."
19025,1997,This prompted detailed examination of the thymus in CCX-CKR(-/-) mice.
19026,1997,"Negatively selected mature SP cells were less abundant in CCX-CKR(-/-) thymi, yet expansion of both DP and immature SP cells was apparent."
19027,1997,Deletion of CCX-CKR also profoundly reduced proportions of DN3 thymocyte precursors and caused DN2 cells to accumulate within the medulla.
19028,1997,"These effects are likely driven by alterations in thymic stroma as CCX-CKR(-/-) mice have fewer cTECs per thymocyte, and cTECs express the highest level of CCX-CKR in the thymus."
19029,1997,"A profound decrease in CCL25 within the thymic cortex was observed in CCX-CKR(-/-) thymi, likely accounting for their defects in thymocyte distribution and frequency."
19030,1997,"These findings identify a novel role for CCX-CKR in regulating cTEC biology, which promotes optimal thymocyte development and selection important for self-tolerant adaptive immunity."
19031,1998,"OBJECTIVES: IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory condition of unknown aetiology."
19032,1998,We have recently described clonally expanded circulating CD4(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in IgG4-RD that infiltrate affected tissues where they secrete interleukin (IL)-1 and transforming growth factor -1 (TGF-1).
19033,1998,"In this study, we sought to examine the role of CD4(+) CTLs in the pathogenesis of IgG4-related dacryoadenitis and sialoadenitis (IgG4-DS) and to determine whether these cells secrete interferon-gamma (IFN-) at lesional sites."
19034,1998,"METHODS: Salivary glands of 25 patients with IgG4-DS, 22 patients with Sjgren's syndrome (SS), 12 patients with chronic sialoadenitis (CS) and 12 healthy controls were analysed in this study."
19035,1998,"Gene expression analysis was performed on submandibular glands (SMGs) from five patients with IgG4-DS, three with CS and three healthy controls."
19036,1998,"Infiltrating CD4(+) CTLs were examined by quantitative multicolour imaging in tissue samples from 20 patients with IgG4-DS, 22 patients with SS, 9 patients with CS and 9 healthy controls."
19037,1998,"RESULTS: In IgG4-DS tissues, nine genes associated with CD4(+) CTLs were overexpressed."
19038,1998,The expression of granzyme A (GZMA) mRNA was significantly higher in samples from patients with IgG4-RD compared with corresponding tissues from SS and healthy controls.
19039,1998,Quantitative imaging showed that infiltrating CD4(+) GZMA(+) CTLs were more abundant in patients with IgG4-DS than in the other groups.
19040,1998,The ratio of CD4(+)GZMA(+) CTLs in SMGs from patients with IgG4-DS correlated with serum IgG4 concentrations and the number of affected organs.
19041,1998,A large fraction of CD4(+)GZMA(+) CTLs in SMGs from patients with IgG4-DS secreted IFN-.
19042,1998,CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of IgG4-DS is associated with tissue infiltration by CD4(+)GZMA(+) CTLs that secrete IFN-.
19043,1999,We encountered a neonatal patient with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) whose mother was positive for anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies.
19044,1999,Complete atrioventricular block was found in a male patient at 29 weeks of gestation.
19045,1999,The patient was born at 40 weeks of gestation.
19046,1999,"He showed severe circulatory disturbance at 22 h after the birth, and he also had elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (1027 IU l(-1)), alanine aminotransferase (121 IU l(-1)), lactic dehydrogenase (3490 IU l(-1)), ferritin (9769.7 ng ml(-1)) and soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor (3230 U ml(-1))."
19047,1999,"We could not find any known HLH genetic abnormality in the patient, but he fulfilled seven of the eight criteria for HLH."
19048,1999,"Serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 had been already elevated in his cord blood, and serum levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-8 were significantly increased on the second day of life."
19049,1999,His symptoms regressed with the administration of hydrocortisone.
19050,1999,We presumed that transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies could be related to the occurrence of HLH.
19051,2000,Previous studies revealed high incidence of acquired N-glycosylation sites acquired N-glycosylation sites in RNA transcripts encoding immunoglobulin heavy variable region (IGHV) 3 genes from parotid glands of primary Sjgren's syndrome (pSS) patients.
19052,2000,"In this study, next generation sequencing was used to study the extent of ac-Nglycs among clonally expanded cells from all IGVH families in the salivary glands of pSS patients."
19053,2000,RNA was isolated from parotid gland biopsies of five pSS patients and five non-pSS sicca controls.
19054,2000,"IGHV sequences covering all functional IGHV genes were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed."
19055,2000,"Each biopsy recovered 1,800-4,000 unique IGHV sequences."
19056,2000,No difference in IGHV gene usage was observed between pSS and non-pSS sequences.
19057,2000,Clonally related sequences with more than 0.3% of the total number of sequences per patient were referred to as dominant clone.
19058,2000,"Overall, 70 dominant clones were found in pSS biopsies, compared to 15 in non-pSS."
19059,2000,No difference in percentage mutation in dominant clone-derived IGHV sequences was seen between pSS and non-pSS.
19060,2000,"In pSS, no evidence for antigen-driven selection in dominant clones was found."
19061,2000,We observed a significantly higher amount of ac-Nglycs among pSS dominant clone-derived sequences compared to non-pSS.
19062,2000,"Ac-Nglycs were, however, not restricted to dominant clones or IGHV gene."
19063,2000,Most ac-Nglycs were detected in the framework 3 region.
19064,2000,No stereotypic rheumatoid factor rearrangements were found in dominant clones.
19065,2000,"Lineage tree analysis showed in four pSS patients, but not in non-pSS, the presence of the germline sequence from a dominant clone."
19066,2000,Presence of germline sequence and mutated IGHV sequences in the same dominant clone provide evidence that this clone originated from a nave B-cell recruited into the parotid gland to expand and differentiate locally into plasma cells.
19067,2000,"The increased presence of ac-Nglycs in IGHV sequences, due to somatic hypermutation, might provide B-cells an escape mechanism to survive during immune response."
19068,2000,We speculate that glycosylation of the B-cell receptor makes the cell sensitive to environmental lectin signals to contribute to aberrant B-cell selection in pSS parotid glands.
